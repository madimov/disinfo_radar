One _ O
night _ O
in _ O
2014 _ O
, _ O
Ian _ O
Goodfellow _ O
went _ O
drinking _ O
to _ O
celebrate _ O
with _ O
a _ O
fellow _ O
doctoral _ O
student _ O
who _ O
had _ O
just _ O
graduated _ O
. _ O

At _ O
Les _ O
3 _ O
Brasseurs _ O
( _ O
The _ O
Three _ O
Brewers _ O
) _ O
, _ O
a _ O
favorite _ O
Montreal _ O
watering _ O
hole _ O
, _ O
some _ O
friends _ O
asked _ O
for _ O
his _ O
help _ O
with _ O
a _ O
thorny _ O
project _ O
they _ O
were _ O
working _ O
on _ O
: _ O
a _ O
computer _ B-TECH
that _ O
could _ O
create _ O
photos _ O
by _ O
itself _ O
. _ O

Researchers _ O
were _ O
already _ O
using _ O
neural _ B-TECH
networks _ I-TECH
, _ O
algorithms _ B-TECH
loosely _ O
modeled _ O
on _ O
the _ O
web _ O
of _ O
neurons _ O
in _ O
the _ O
human _ O
brain _ O
, _ O
as _ O
generative _ B-TECH
models _ I-TECH
to _ O
create _ O
plausible _ O
new _ O
data _ O
of _ O
their _ O
own _ O
. _ O

But _ O
the _ O
results _ O
were _ O
often _ O
not _ O
very _ O
good _ O
: _ O
images _ O
of _ O
a _ O
computer-generated _ O
face _ O
tended _ O
to _ O
be _ O
blurry _ O
or _ O
have _ O
errors _ O
like _ O
missing _ O
ears _ O
. _ O

The _ O
plan _ O
Goodfellows _ O
friends _ O
were _ O
proposing _ O
was _ O
to _ O
use _ O
a _ O
complex _ O
statistical _ O
analysis _ O
of _ O
the _ O
elements _ O
that _ O
make _ O
up _ O
a _ O
photograph _ O
to _ O
help _ O
machines _ O
come _ O
up _ O
with _ O
images _ O
by _ O
themselves _ O
. _ O

This _ O
would _ O
have _ O
required _ O
a _ O
massive _ O
amount _ O
of _ O
number-crunching _ O
, _ O
and _ O
Goodfellow _ O
told _ O
them _ O
it _ O
simply _ O
wasnt _ O
going _ O
to _ O
work _ O
. _ O

But _ O
as _ O
he _ O
pondered _ O
the _ O
problem _ O
over _ O
his _ O
beer _ O
, _ O
he _ O
hit _ O
on _ O
an _ O
idea _ O
. _ O

What _ O
if _ O
you _ O
pitted _ O
two _ O
neural _ B-TECH
networks _ I-TECH
against _ O
each _ O
other _ O
? _ O

His _ O
friends _ O
were _ O
skeptical _ O
, _ O
so _ O
once _ O
he _ O
got _ O
home _ O
, _ O
where _ O
his _ O
girlfriend _ O
was _ O
already _ O
fast _ O
asleep _ O
, _ O
he _ O
decided _ O
to _ O
give _ O
it _ O
a _ O
try _ O
. _ O

Goodfellow _ O
coded _ O
into _ O
the _ O
early _ O
hours _ O
and _ O
then _ O
tested _ O
his _ O
software _ O
. _ O

It _ O
worked _ O
the _ O
first _ O
time _ O
. _ O

What _ O
he _ O
invented _ O
that _ O
night _ O
is _ O
now _ O
called _ O
a _ O
GAN _ B-TECH
, _ O
or _ O
generative _ B-TECH
adversarial _ I-TECH
network _ I-TECH
. _ O

The _ O
technique _ O
has _ O
sparked _ O
huge _ O
excitement _ O
in _ O
the _ O
field _ O
of _ O
machine _ B-TECH
learning _ I-TECH
and _ O
turned _ O
its _ O
creator _ O
into _ O
an _ O
AI _ B-TECH
celebrity _ O
. _ O

In _ O
the _ O
last _ O
few _ O
years _ O
, _ O
AI _ B-TECH
researchers _ O
have _ O
made _ O
impressive _ O
progress _ O
using _ O
a _ O
technique _ O
called _ O
deep _ B-TECH
learning _ I-TECH
. _ O

Supply _ O
a _ O
deep-learning _ B-TECH
system _ O
with _ O
enough _ O
images _ O
and _ O
it _ O
learns _ O
to _ O
, _ O
say _ O
, _ O
recognize _ O
a _ O
pedestrian _ O
whos _ O
about _ O
to _ O
cross _ O
a _ O
road _ O
. _ O

This _ O
approach _ O
has _ O
made _ O
possible _ O
things _ O
like _ O
self-driving _ B-TECH
cars _ I-TECH
and _ O
the _ O
conversational _ B-TECH
technology _ I-TECH
that _ O
powers _ O
Alexa _ O
, _ O
Siri _ O
, _ O
and _ O
other _ O
virtual _ B-TECH
assistants _ I-TECH
. _ O

But _ O
while _ O
deep-learning _ B-TECH
AIs _ I-TECH
can _ O
learn _ O
to _ O
recognize _ O
things _ O
, _ O
they _ O
have _ O
not _ O
been _ O
good _ O
at _ O
creating _ O
them _ O
. _ O

The _ O
goal _ O
of _ O
GANs _ B-TECH
is _ O
to _ O
give _ O
machines _ O
something _ O
akin _ O
to _ O
an _ O
imagination _ O
. _ O

In _ O
the _ O
future _ O
, _ O
computers _ B-TECH
will _ O
get _ O
much _ O
better _ O
at _ O
feasting _ O
on _ O
raw _ O
data _ O
and _ O
working _ O
out _ O
what _ O
they _ O
need _ O
to _ O
learn _ O
from _ O
it _ O
. _ O

Doing _ O
so _ O
wouldnt _ O
merely _ O
enable _ O
them _ O
to _ O
draw _ O
pretty _ O
pictures _ O
or _ O
compose _ O
music _ O
; _ O
it _ O
would _ O
make _ O
them _ O
less _ O
reliant _ O
on _ O
humans _ O
to _ O
instruct _ O
them _ O
about _ O
the _ O
world _ O
and _ O
the _ O
way _ O
it _ O
works _ O
. _ O

Today _ O
, _ O
AI _ B-TECH
programmers _ O
often _ O
need _ O
to _ O
tell _ O
a _ O
machine _ O
exactly _ O
whats _ O
in _ O
the _ O
training _ O
data _ O
its _ O
being _ O
fedwhich _ O
of _ O
a _ O
million _ O
pictures _ O
contain _ O
a _ O
pedestrian _ O
crossing _ O
a _ O
road _ O
, _ O
and _ O
which _ O
dont _ O
. _ O

This _ O
is _ O
not _ O
only _ O
costly _ O
and _ O
labor-intensive _ O
; _ O
it _ O
limits _ O
how _ O
well _ O
the _ O
system _ O
deals _ O
with _ O
even _ O
slight _ O
departures _ O
from _ O
what _ O
it _ O
was _ O
trained _ O
on _ O
. _ O

In _ O
the _ O
future _ O
, _ O
computers _ O
will _ O
get _ O
much _ O
better _ O
at _ O
feasting _ O
on _ O
raw _ O
data _ O
and _ O
working _ O
out _ O
what _ O
they _ O
need _ O
to _ O
learn _ O
from _ O
it _ O
without _ O
being _ O
told _ O
. _ O

That _ O
will _ O
mark _ O
a _ O
big _ O
leap _ O
forward _ O
in _ O
whats _ O
known _ O
in _ O
AI _ B-TECH
as _ O
unsupervised _ B-TECH
learning _ I-TECH
. _ O

A _ O
self-driving _ B-TECH
car _ I-TECH
could _ O
teach _ O
itself _ O
about _ O
many _ O
different _ O
road _ O
conditions _ O
without _ O
leaving _ O
the _ O
garage _ O
. _ O

A _ O
robot _ B-TECH
could _ O
anticipate _ O
the _ O
obstacles _ O
it _ O
might _ O
encounter _ O
in _ O
a _ O
busy _ O
warehouse _ O
without _ O
needing _ O
to _ O
be _ O
taken _ O
around _ O
it _ O
. _ O

That _ O
will _ O
mark _ O
a _ O
big _ O
leap _ O
forward _ O
in _ O
what _ O
is _ O
known _ O
in _ O
AI _ B-TECH
as _ O
unsupervised _ B-TECH
learning _ I-TECH
. _ O

Our _ O
ability _ O
to _ O
imagine _ O
and _ O
reflect _ O
on _ O
many _ O
different _ O
scenarios _ O
is _ O
part _ O
of _ O
what _ O
makes _ O
us _ O
human _ O
. _ O

And _ O
when _ O
future _ O
historians _ O
of _ O
technology _ O
look _ O
back _ O
, _ O
theyre _ O
likely _ O
to _ O
see _ O
GANs _ B-TECH
as _ O
a _ O
big _ O
step _ O
toward _ O
creating _ O
machines _ B-TECH
with _ I-TECH
a _ I-TECH
human-like _ I-TECH
consciousness _ I-TECH
. _ O

Yann _ O

the _ O
coolest _ O
idea _ O
in _ O

in _ O
the _ O

Andrew _ O
Ng _ O
, _ O
the _ O

of _ O

, _ O
says _ O
GANs _ B-TECH
represent _ O
a _ O
significant _ O
and _ O
fundamental _ O
advance _ O
thats _ O
inspired _ O
a _ O
growing _ O
global _ O

of _ O

The _ O

, _ O
Part _ O
II _ O
: _ O
AI _ O

club _ O
Goodfellow _ O
is _ O
now _ O
a _ O
research _ O
scientist _ O
on _ O
the _ O
Google _ O
Brain _ O
team _ O
, _ O
at _ O
the _ O
companys _ O
headquarters _ O
in _ O
Mountain _ O
View _ O
, _ O
California _ O
. _ O

When _ O
I _ O
met _ O
him _ O
there _ O
recently _ O
, _ O
he _ O
still _ O
seemed _ O
surprised _ O
by _ O
his _ O
superstar _ O
status _ O
, _ O
calling _ O
it _ O
a _ O
little _ O
surreal _ O
. _ O

Perhaps _ O
no _ O
less _ O
surprising _ O
is _ O
that _ O
, _ O
having _ O
made _ O
his _ O
discovery _ O
, _ O
he _ O
now _ O
spends _ O
much _ O
of _ O
his _ O
time _ O
working _ O
against _ O
those _ O
who _ O
wish _ O
to _ O
use _ O
it _ O
for _ O
evil _ O
ends _ O
. _ O

The _ O
magic _ O
of _ O
GANs _ B-TECH
lies _ O
in _ O
the _ O
rivalry _ O
between _ O
the _ O
two _ O
neural _ B-TECH
nets _ I-TECH
. _ O

It _ O
mimics _ O
the _ O
back-and-forth _ O
between _ O
a _ O
picture _ O
forger _ O
and _ O
an _ O
art _ O
detective _ O
who _ O
repeatedly _ O
try _ O
to _ O
outwit _ O
one _ O
another _ O
. _ O

Both _ O
networks _ B-TECH
are _ O
trained _ O
on _ O
the _ O
same _ O
data _ O
set _ O
. _ O

The _ O
first _ O
one _ O
, _ O
known _ O
as _ O
the _ O
generator _ B-TECH
, _ O
is _ O
charged _ O
with _ O
producing _ O
artificial _ O
outputs _ O
, _ O
such _ O
as _ O
photos _ O
or _ O
handwriting _ O
, _ O
that _ O
are _ O
as _ O
realistic _ O
as _ O
possible _ O
. _ O

The _ O
second _ O
, _ O
known _ O
as _ O
the _ O
discriminator _ B-TECH
, _ O
compares _ O
these _ O
with _ O
genuine _ O
images _ O
from _ O
the _ O
original _ O
data _ O
set _ O
and _ O
tries _ O
to _ O
determine _ O
which _ O
are _ O
real _ O
and _ O
which _ O
are _ O
fake _ O
. _ O

On _ O
the _ O
basis _ O
of _ O
those _ O
results _ O
, _ O
the _ O
generator _ B-TECH
adjusts _ O
its _ O
parameters _ O
for _ O
creating _ O
new _ O
images _ O
. _ O

And _ O
so _ O
it _ O
goes _ O
, _ O
until _ O
the _ O
discriminator _ B-TECH
can _ O
no _ O
longer _ O
tell _ O
whats _ O
genuine _ O
and _ O
whats _ O
bogus _ O
. _ O

A _ O
GAN _ B-TECH
trained _ O
on _ O
photos _ O
of _ O
real _ O
celebrities _ O
came _ O
up _ O
with _ O
its _ O
own _ O
set _ O
of _ O
imaginary _ O
stars _ O
. _ O

In _ O
most _ O
cases _ O
, _ O
the _ O
fakes _ O
looked _ O
pretty _ O
realistic _ O
. _ O

In _ O
one _ O
widely _ O
publicized _ O
example _ O
last _ O
year _ O
, _ O
researchers _ O
at _ O
Nvidia _ O
, _ O
a _ O
chip _ B-TECH
company _ O
heavily _ O
invested _ O
in _ O
AI _ B-TECH
, _ O
trained _ O
a _ O
GAN _ B-TECH
to _ O
generate _ O
pictures _ O
of _ O
imaginary _ O
celebrities _ O
by _ O
studying _ O
real _ O
ones _ O
. _ O

Not _ O
all _ O
the _ O
fake _ O
stars _ O
it _ O
produced _ O
were _ O
perfect _ O
, _ O
but _ O
some _ O
were _ O
impressively _ O
realistic _ O
. _ O

Unlike _ O
other _ O
machine-learning _ B-TECH
approaches _ O
that _ O
require _ O
tens _ O
of _ O
thousands _ O
of _ O
training _ O
images _ O
, _ O
GANs _ B-TECH
can _ O
become _ O
proficient _ O
with _ O
a _ O
few _ O
hundred _ O
. _ O

This _ O
power _ O
of _ O
imagination _ O
is _ O
still _ O
limited _ O
. _ O

Once _ O
its _ O
been _ O
trained _ O
on _ O
a _ O
lot _ O
of _ O
dog _ O
photos _ O
, _ O
a _ O
GAN _ B-TECH
can _ O
generate _ O
a _ O
convincing _ O
fake _ B-TECH
image _ I-TECH
of _ O
a _ O
dog _ O
that _ O
has _ O
, _ O
say _ O
, _ O
a _ O
different _ O
pattern _ O
of _ O
spots _ O
; _ O
but _ O
it _ O
cant _ O
conceive _ O
of _ O
an _ O
entirely _ O
new _ O
animal _ O
. _ O

The _ O
quality _ O
of _ O
the _ O
original _ O
training _ O
data _ O
also _ O
has _ O
a _ O
big _ O
influence _ O
on _ O
the _ O
results _ O
. _ O

In _ O
one _ O
telling _ O
example _ O
, _ O
a _ O
GAN _ B-TECH
began _ O
producing _ O
pictures _ O
of _ O
cats _ O
with _ O
random _ O
letters _ O
integrated _ O
into _ O
the _ O
images _ O
. _ O

Because _ O
the _ O
training _ O
data _ O
contained _ O
cat _ O
memes _ O
from _ O
the _ O
internet _ B-TECH
, _ O
the _ O
machine _ O
had _ O
taught _ O
itself _ O
that _ O
words _ O
were _ O
part _ O
of _ O
what _ O
it _ O
meant _ O
to _ O
be _ O
a _ O
cat _ O
. _ O

GANs _ B-TECH
are _ O
also _ O
temperamental _ O
, _ O
says _ O
Pedro _ O
Domingos _ O
, _ O
a _ O
machine-learning _ B-TECH
researcher _ O
at _ O
the _ O
University _ O
of _ O
Washington _ O
. _ O

If _ O
the _ O
discriminator _ B-TECH
is _ O
too _ O
easy _ O
to _ O
fool _ O
, _ O
the _ O
generators _ B-TECH
output _ O
wont _ O
look _ O
realistic _ O
. _ O

And _ O
calibrating _ O
the _ O
two _ O
dueling _ O
neural _ B-TECH
nets _ I-TECH
can _ O
be _ O
difficult _ O
, _ O
which _ O
explains _ O
why _ O
GANs _ B-TECH
sometimes _ O
spit _ O
out _ O
bizarre _ O
stuff _ O
such _ O
as _ O
animals _ O
with _ O
two _ O
heads _ O
. _ O

Still _ O
, _ O
the _ O
challenges _ O
havent _ O
deterred _ O
researchers _ O
. _ O

Since _ O
Goodfellow _ O
and _ O
a _ O
few _ O
others _ O
published _ O
the _ O
first _ O
study _ O
on _ O
his _ O
discovery _ O
, _ O
in _ O
2014 _ O
, _ O
hundreds _ O
of _ O
GAN-related _ B-TECH
papers _ O
have _ O
been _ O
written _ O
. _ O

One _ O
fan _ O
of _ O
the _ O
technology _ B-TECH
has _ O
even _ O
created _ O
a _ O
web _ B-TECH
page _ I-TECH
called _ O
the _ O
GAN _ B-TECH
zoo _ O
, _ O
dedicated _ O
to _ O
keeping _ O
track _ O
of _ O
the _ O
various _ O
versions _ O
of _ O
the _ O
technique _ O
that _ O
have _ O
been _ O
developed _ O
. _ O

The _ O
most _ O
obvious _ O
immediate _ O
applications _ O
are _ O
in _ O
areas _ O
that _ O
involve _ O
a _ O
lot _ O
of _ O
imagery _ O
, _ O
such _ O
as _ O
video _ B-TECH
games _ I-TECH
and _ O
fashion _ O
: _ O
what _ O
, _ O
for _ O
instance _ O
, _ O
might _ O
a _ O
game _ O
character _ O
look _ O
like _ O
running _ O
through _ O
the _ O
rain _ O
? _ O

But _ O
looking _ O
ahead _ O
, _ O
Goodfellow _ O
thinks _ O
GANs _ B-TECH
will _ O
drive _ O
more _ O
significant _ O
advances _ O
. _ O

There _ O
are _ O
a _ O
lot _ O
of _ O
areas _ O
of _ O
science _ O
and _ O
engineering _ O
where _ O
we _ O
need _ O
to _ O
optimize _ O
something _ O
, _ O
he _ O
says _ O
, _ O
citing _ O
examples _ O
such _ O
as _ O
medicines _ B-TECH
that _ O
need _ O
to _ O
be _ O
more _ O
effective _ O
or _ O
batteries _ B-TECH
that _ O
must _ O
get _ O
more _ O
efficient _ O
. _ O

Thats _ O
going _ O
to _ O
be _ O
the _ O
next _ O
big _ O
wave _ O
. _ O

In _ O
high-energy _ O
physics _ O
, _ O
scientists _ O
use _ O
powerful _ O
computers _ B-TECH
to _ O
simulate _ O
the _ O
likely _ O
interactions _ O
of _ O
hundreds _ O
of _ O
subatomic _ O
particles _ O
in _ O
machines _ B-TECH
like _ O
the _ O
Large _ B-TECH
Hadron _ I-TECH
Collider _ I-TECH
at _ O
CERN _ O
in _ O
Switzerland _ O
. _ O

These _ O
simulations _ B-TECH
are _ O
slow _ O
and _ O
require _ O
massive _ O
computing _ O
power _ O
. _ O

Researchers _ O
at _ O
Yale _ O
University _ O
and _ O
Lawrence _ O
Berkeley _ O
National _ O
Laboratory _ O
have _ O
developed _ O
a _ O
GAN _ B-TECH
that _ O
, _ O
after _ O
training _ O
on _ O
existing _ O
simulation _ O
data _ O
, _ O
learns _ O
to _ O
generate _ O
pretty _ O
accurate _ O
predictions _ O
of _ O
how _ O
a _ O
particular _ O
particle _ O
will _ O
behave _ O
, _ O
and _ O
does _ O
it _ O
much _ O
faster _ O
. _ O

Goodfellow's _ O
creation _ O
can _ O
be _ O
used _ O
to _ O
imagine _ O
all _ O
sorts _ O
of _ O
things _ O
, _ O
including _ O
new _ O
interior _ O
designs _ O
. _ O

Medical _ O
research _ O
is _ O
another _ O
promising _ O
field _ O
. _ O

Privacy _ O
concerns _ O
mean _ O
researchers _ O
sometimes _ O
cant _ O
get _ O
enough _ O
real _ O
patient _ O
data _ O
to _ O
, _ O
say _ O
, _ O
analyze _ O
why _ O
a _ O
drug _ O
didnt _ O
work _ O
. _ O

GANs _ B-TECH
can _ O
help _ O
solve _ O
this _ O
problem _ O
by _ O
generating _ O
fake _ O
records _ O
that _ O
are _ O
almost _ O
as _ O
good _ O
as _ O
the _ O
real _ O
thing _ O
, _ O
says _ O
Casey _ O
Greene _ O
of _ O
the _ O
University _ O
of _ O
Pennsylvania _ O
. _ O

This _ O
data _ O
could _ O
be _ O
shared _ O
more _ O
widely _ O
, _ O
helping _ O
to _ O
advance _ O
research _ O
, _ O
while _ O
