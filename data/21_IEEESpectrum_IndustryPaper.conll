CHOI _ O
Just _ O
as _ O
multiplexing _ O
can _ O
help _ O
a _ O
single _ O
communication _ B-TECH
channel _ I-TECH
carry _ O
many _ O
signals _ O
at _ O
the _ O
same _ O
time _ O
, _ O
a _ O
new _ O
study _ O
reveals _ O
that _ O
multiplexing _ O
can _ O
help _ O
neural _ O
networksthe _ O
AI _ B-TECH
systems _ I-TECH
that _ O
now _ O
often _ O
power _ O
speech _ B-TECH
recognition _ I-TECH
, _ O
computer _ B-TECH
vision _ I-TECH
, _ O
and _ O
morescan _ O
dozens _ O
of _ O
streams _ O
of _ O
data _ O
simultaneously _ O
, _ O
letting _ O
them _ O
greatly _ O
boost _ O
the _ O
rate _ O
at _ O
which _ O
they _ O
analyze _ O
information _ O
. _ O

In _ O
artificial _ B-TECH
neural _ I-TECH
networks _ I-TECH
, _ O
components _ O
dubbed _ O
neurons _ O
are _ O
fed _ O
data _ O
and _ O
cooperate _ O
to _ O
solve _ O
a _ O
problem _ O
, _ O
such _ O
as _ O
recognizing _ O
images _ O
. _ O

The _ O
neural _ B-TECH
net _ I-TECH
repeatedly _ O
adjusts _ O
the _ O
links _ O
between _ O
its _ O
neurons _ O
and _ O
sees _ O
if _ O
the _ O
resulting _ O
patterns _ O
of _ O
behavior _ O
are _ O
better _ O
at _ O
finding _ O
a _ O
solution _ O
. _ O

Over _ O
time _ O
, _ O
the _ O
network _ O
discovers _ O
which _ O
patterns _ O
are _ O
best _ O
at _ O
computing _ O
results _ O
. _ O

It _ O
then _ O
adopts _ O
these _ O
as _ O
defaults _ O
, _ O
mimicking _ O
the _ O
process _ O
of _ O
learning _ O
in _ O
the _ O
human _ O
brain _ O
. _ O

The _ O
features _ O
of _ O
a _ O
neural _ B-TECH
net _ I-TECH
that _ O
change _ O
with _ O
learning _ O
, _ O
such _ O
as _ O
the _ O
nature _ O
of _ O
the _ O
connections _ O
between _ O
neurons _ O
, _ O
are _ O
known _ O
as _ O
its _ O
parameters _ O
. _ O

Recent _ O
research _ O
suggests _ O
that _ O
modern _ O
neural _ B-TECH
networks _ I-TECH
often _ O
have _ O
vastly _ O
more _ O
parameters _ O
than _ O
they _ O
needpotentially _ O
, _ O
they _ O
could _ O
prune _ O
the _ O
numbers _ O
of _ O
their _ O
parameters _ O
by _ O
more _ O
than _ O
90 _ O
percent _ O
to _ O
reduce _ O
their _ O
sizes _ O
without _ O
harming _ O
their _ O
accuracy _ O
. _ O

This _ O
raised _ O
a _ O
question _ O
that _ O
researchers _ O
at _ O
Princeton _ O
University _ O
aimed _ O
to _ O
addressif _ O
neural _ B-TECH
networks _ I-TECH
possessed _ O
more _ O
computing _ O
power _ O
than _ O
they _ O
needed _ O
, _ O
could _ O
they _ O
each _ O
analyze _ O
multiple _ O
streams _ O
of _ O
information _ O
simultaneously _ O
to _ O
help _ O
learn _ O
a _ O
task _ O
, _ O
just _ O
as _ O
a _ O
radio _ B-TECH
channel _ O
can _ O
share _ O
its _ O
bandwidth _ O
to _ O
carry _ O
multiple _ O
signals _ O
at _ O
the _ O
same _ O
time _ O
? _ O

The _ O
researchers _ O
developed _ O
a _ O
technique _ O
they _ O
named _ O
DataMUX _ B-TECH
wherein _ O
a _ O
neural _ B-TECH
network _ I-TECH
can _ O
analyze _ O
multiple _ O
data _ O
feeds _ O
simultaneously _ O
as _ O
one _ O
mixed _ O
clump _ O
of _ O
information _ O
. _ O

This _ O
can _ O
significantly _ O
boost _ O
its _ O
efficiency _ O
, _ O
letting _ O
it _ O
analyze _ O
substantially _ O
more _ O
quickly _ O
while _ O
demanding _ O
little _ O
in _ O
the _ O
way _ O
of _ O
extra _ O
time _ O
, _ O
computation _ O
, _ O
or _ O
memory _ O
requirements _ O
. _ O

They _ O
suggest _ O
their _ O
new _ O
method _ O
, _ O
which _ O
they _ O
detailed _ O
online _ O
18 _ O
February _ O
on _ O
the _ O
ArXiv _ O
preprint _ O
server _ B-TECH
, _ O
may _ O
be _ O
the _ O
first _ O
instance _ O
of _ O
data _ B-TECH
multiplexing _ I-TECH
in _ O
neural _ B-TECH
networks _ I-TECH
. _ O

We _ O
hope _ O
this _ O
can _ O
have _ O
a _ O
substantial _ O
impact _ O
on _ O
energy _ O
consumption _ O
and _ O
the _ O
environmental _ O
footprint _ O
of _ O
machine-learning _ B-TECH
models _ I-TECH
, _ O
especially _ O
for _ O
computing _ B-TECH
services _ I-TECH
that _ O
process _ O
a _ O
large _ O
number _ O
of _ O

at _ O

DataMUX _ B-TECH
works _ O
by _ O
adding _ O
a _ O
multiplexing _ B-TECH
layer _ I-TECH
and _ O
a _ O
demultiplexing _ B-TECH
layer _ I-TECH
to _ O
both _ O
ends _ O
of _ O
a _ O
neural _ B-TECH
network _ I-TECH
. _ O

The _ O
signals _ O
entering _ O
the _ O
neural _ B-TECH
network _ I-TECH
are _ O
each _ O
given _ O
a _ O
specific _ O
unique _ O
key _ O
to _ O
help _ O
distinguish _ O
them _ O
all _ O
, _ O
and _ O
the _ O
multiplexing _ B-TECH
layer _ I-TECH
then _ O
merges _ O
these _ O
multiple _ O
inputs _ O
together _ O
into _ O
a _ O
single _ O
compressed _ O
feed _ O
. _ O

After _ O
the _ O
neural _ B-TECH
network _ I-TECH
processes _ O
this _ O
input _ O
, _ O
the _ O
demultiplexing _ O
layer _ O
converts _ O
the _ O
combined _ O
output _ O
back _ O
into _ O
multiple _ O
separate _ O
results _ O
. _ O

The _ O
scientists _ O
conducted _ O
experiments _ O
with _ O
DataMUX _ B-TECH
using _ O
three _ O
different _ O
kinds _ O
of _ O
neural _ O
networkstransformers _ O
, _ O
multilayer _ B-TECH
perceptrons _ I-TECH
, _ O
and _ O
convolutional _ B-TECH
neural _ I-TECH
networks _ I-TECH
. _ O

The _ O
experiments _ O
involved _ O
several _ O
tasksimage _ B-TECH
recognition _ I-TECH
; _ O
sentence _ B-TECH
classification _ I-TECH
, _ O
in _ O
which _ O
a _ O
machine _ O
aims _ O
to _ O
identify _ O
whether _ O
text _ O
is _ O
spam _ O
, _ O
a _ O
business _ O
article _ O
, _ O
and _ O
so _ O
on _ O
; _ O
named _ B-TECH
entity _ I-TECH
recognition _ I-TECH
, _ O
which _ O
involves _ O
locating _ O
and _ O
classifying _ O
named _ O
entities _ O
such _ O
as _ O
people _ O
, _ O
groups _ O
, _ O
and _ O
places _ O
. _ O

Experiments _ O
with _ O
transformers _ B-TECH
on _ O
text-classification _ B-TECH
tasks _ O
revealed _ O
they _ O
could _ O
multiplex _ O
up _ O
to _ O
40 _ O
inputs _ O
, _ O
achieving _ O
up _ O
to _ O
an _ O
18 _ O
- _ O
fold _ O
speedup _ O
in _ O
the _ O
rate _ O
at _ O
which _ O
they _ O
could _ O
process _ O
these _ O
inputs _ O
with _ O
as _ O
little _ O
as _ O
a _ O
2 _ O
percent _ O
drop _ O
in _ O
accuracy _ O
. _ O

We _ O
could _ O
aim _ O
to _ O
increase _ O
throughput _ O
of _ O
machine-learning _ B-TECH
models _ I-TECH
manyfold _ O
, _ O
Murahari _ O
says _ O
. _ O

This _ O
is _ O
profound _ O
since _ O
it _ O
opens _ O
up _ O
applications _ O
where _ O
one _ O
might _ O
need _ O
to _ O
invoke _ O
the _ O
model _ O
dynamically _ O
with _ O
high _ O
frequency _ O
. _ O

For _ O
instance _ O
, _ O
imagine _ O
an _ O
assistive _ B-TECH
writing _ I-TECH
application _ I-TECH
where _ O
one _ O
could _ O
invoke _ O
state-of-the-art _ O
language _ B-TECH
models _ I-TECH
very _ O
frequently _ O
, _ O
leading _ O
to _ O
a _ O
more _ O
intuitive _ O
and _ O
a _ O
smooth _ O
running _ O
application _ O
. _ O

In _ O
addition _ O
, _ O
products _ O
using _ O
large _ B-TECH
machine-learning _ I-TECH
models _ I-TECH
could _ O
decrease _ O
their _ O
compute _ O
costs _ O
dramatically _ O
with _ O
DataMUX _ B-TECH
, _ O
Murahari _ O
says _ O
. _ O

We _ O
could _ O
also _ O
imagine _ O
models _ B-TECH
running _ O
on _ O
less _ O
specialized _ O
hardware _ B-TECH
, _ O
such _ O
as _ O
CPUs _ B-TECH
instead _ O
of _ O
GPUs _ B-TECH
, _ O
since _ O
models _ O
running _ O
DataMUX _ B-TECH
on _ O
CPUs _ B-TECH
could _ O
close _ O
the _ O
throughput _ O
gap _ O
with _ O
nonmultiplexed _ O
models _ B-TECH
running _ O
on _ O
GPU _ B-TECH
. _ O

This _ O
would _ O
enable _ O
a _ O
large _ O
number _ O
of _ O
machine-learning _ B-TECH
applications _ I-TECH
to _ O
run _ O
on _ O
low-resource _ B-TECH
edge _ I-TECH
devices _ I-TECH
. _ O

This _ O
40 _ O
- _ O
fold _ O
increase _ O
in _ O
the _ O
inputs _ O
received _ O
led _ O
to _ O
only _ O
an _ O
18 _ O
- _ O
fold _ O
boost _ O
in _ O
throughput _ O
, _ O
instead _ O
of _ O
the _ O
expected _ O
40 _ O
- _ O
fold _ O
enhancement _ O
, _ O
likely _ O
because _ O
of _ O
the _ O
way _ O
in _ O
which _ O
the _ O
keys _ O
associated _ O
with _ O
each _ O
input _ O
grew _ O
in _ O
length _ O
the _ O
more _ O
inputs _ O
there _ O
were _ O
. _ O

Future _ O
work _ O
may _ O
potentially _ O
improve _ O
this _ O
speedup _ O
through _ O
better _ O
multiplexing _ B-TECH
and _ O
demultiplexing _ B-TECH
strategies _ O
, _ O
the _ O
researchers _ O
say _ O
. _ O

As _ O
to _ O
how _ O
neural _ B-TECH
networks _ I-TECH
using _ O
DataMUX _ B-TECH
do _ O
not _ O
get _ O
confused _ O

nothing _ O

to _ O
be _ O
done _ O
to _ O

get _ O
to _ O
the _ O

of _ O
this _ O

A _ O

is _ O
not _ O

to _ O
performing _ O

that _ O
it _ O

In _ O
