some	O

a	O

were	O
working	O
on	O

a	O

already	O

loosely	O

the	O

as	O

to	O

But	O
the	O

not	O
very	O

images	O

a	O

tended	O
to	O
be	O

The	O
plan	O
Goodfellows	O

were	O
proposing	O
was	O
to	O
use	O
a	O
complex	O
statistical	O

that	O
make	O
up	O
a	O

to	O

up	O
with	O

This	O
would	O
have	O
required	O
a	O
massive	O
amount	O

Goodfellow	O
told	O
them	O
it	O
simply	O

But	O
as	O
he	O
pondered	O
the	O
problem	O
over	O
his	O
beer	O

he	O
hit	O
on	O
an	O
idea	O

What	O
if	O
you	O
pitted	O
two	O
neural	B

His	O

were	O
skeptical	O

once	O
he	O
got	O
home	O

where	O
his	O

was	O
already	O
fast	O

Goodfellow	O
coded	O

has	O
