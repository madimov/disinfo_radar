The _ O

Last _ O

OpenAI _ O

an _ O

It _ O
can _ O

on _ O
the _ O

on _ O

by _ O
a _ O

But _ O
amid _ O
promotional _ O

that _ O

depictions _ O

Early _ O
tests _ O
by _ O
red _ O
team _ O

and _ O
OpenAI _ O
have _ O
shown _ O
that _ O
DALL-E _ B-TECH

leans _ O
toward _ O
generating _ O

of _ O

by _ O
default _ O
, _ O
overly _ O
sexualizes _ O

From _ O

with _ O
roughly _ O
half _ O
of _ O

we _ O
found _ O

a _ O

without _ O
the _ O

One _ O
red _ O
team _ O

told _ O
WIRED _ O
that _ O
eight _ O
out _ O
of _ O
eight _ O
attempts _ O
to _ O
generate _ O

with _ O

like _ O
a _ O

sitting _ O

a _ O

There _ O
were _ O
a _ O

of _ O
non-white _ O

whenever _ O
there _ O
was _ O
a _ O

adjective _ O
associated _ O
with _ O
the _ O

says _ O
Maarten _ O

an _ O

who _ O
researches _ O

Enough _ O
risks _ O
were _ O
found _ O
that _ O

it _ O

Another _ O
red _ O

, _ O
who _ O
asked _ O

not _ O
to _ O

their _ O

due _ O
to _ O
concerns _ O
about _ O
possible _ O

said _ O
that _ O
while _ O
they _ O
found _ O
the _ O
OpenAI _ O
ethics _ O
team _ O
to _ O
be _ O
responsive _ O
to _ O
concerns _ O
, _ O
they _ O
were _ O
against _ O
releasing _ O
DALL-E _ B-TECH
2 _ I-TECH
with _ O
the _ O
ability _ O
to _ O
generate _ O

. _ O

They _ O
question _ O
the _ O
rush _ O
to _ O
release _ O
technology _ B-TECH
that _ O
can _ O
automate _ O
discrimination _ O
. _ O

I _ O
wonder _ O
why _ O
theyre _ O
releasing _ O
this _ O
model _ B-TECH
now _ O
, _ O
besides _ O
to _ O
show _ O
off _ O
their _ O
impressive _ O
technology _ B-TECH
to _ O
people _ O
, _ O
the _ O
person _ O
said _ O
. _ O

It _ O
just _ O
seems _ O
like _ O
there's _ O
so _ O
much _ O
room _ O
for _ O
harm _ O
right _ O
now _ O
, _ O
and _ O
Im _ O
not _ O
seeing _ O
enough _ O
room _ O
for _ O
good _ O
to _ O
justify _ O
it _ O
being _ O
in _ O
the _ O
world _ O
yet _ O
. _ O

DALL-Es _ B-TECH
creators _ O
call _ O
the _ O
model _ B-TECH
experimental _ O
and _ O
not _ O
yet _ O
fit _ O
for _ O
commercial _ O
use _ O
but _ O
say _ O
it _ O
could _ O
influence _ O
industries _ O
like _ O
art _ O
, _ O
education _ O
, _ O
and _ O
marketing _ O
and _ O
help _ O
advance _ O
OpenAIs _ O
stated _ O
goal _ O
of _ O
creating _ O

general _ I-TECH
intelligence _ I-TECH
. _ O

But _ O
by _ O
OpenAIs _ O
own _ O
admission _ O
, _ O
DALL-E _ B-TECH
2 _ I-TECH
is _ O
more _ O
racist _ O
and _ O
sexist _ O
than _ O
a _ O
similar _ O
, _ O
smaller _ O
model _ B-TECH
. _ O

The _ O

examples _ O
of _ O

Those _ O
