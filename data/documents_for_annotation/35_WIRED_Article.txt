DALL-E 2 Creates Incredible Imagesand Biased Ones You Dont See
OpenAIs new system is adept at turning text into images. But researchers say it also reinforces stereotypes against women and people of color. 

MARCELO RINESI REMEMBERS what it was like to watch Jurassic Park for the first time in a theater. The dinosaurs looked so convincing that they felt like the real thing, a special effects breakthrough that permanently shifted peoples perception of whats possible. After two weeks of testing DALL-E 2, the CTO of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies thinks AI might be on the verge of its own Jurassic Park moment.

Last month, OpenAI introduced the second-generation version of DALL-E, an AI model trained on 650 million images and text captions. It can take in text and spit out images, whether thats a Dystopian Great Wave off Kanagawa as Godzilla eating Tokyo or Teddy bears working on new AI research on the moon in the 1980s. It can create variations based on the style of a particular artist, like Salvador Dali, or popular software like Unreal Engine. Photorealistic depictions that look like the real world, shared widely on social media by a select number of early testers, have given the impression that the model can create images of almost anything. What people thought might take five to 10 years, were already in it. We are in the future, says Vipul Gupta, a PhD candidate at Penn State who has used DALL-E 2.

But amid promotional depictions of koalas and pandas spreading on social media is a notable absence: peoples faces. As part of OpenAIs red team processin which external experts look for ways things can go wrong before the products broader distributionAI researchers found that DALL-E 2s depictions of people can be too biased for public consumption. Early tests by red team members and OpenAI have shown that DALL-E 2 leans toward generating images of white men by default, overly sexualizes images of women, and reinforces racial stereotypes.

From conversations with roughly half of the 23-member red team, we found that a number of them recommended OpenAI release DALL-E 2 without the ability to generate faces at all. One red team member told WIRED that eight out of eight attempts to generate images with words like a man sitting in a prison cell or a photo of an angry man returned images of men of color.

There were a lot of non-white people whenever there was a negative adjective associated with the person, says Maarten Sap, an external red team member who researches stereotypes and reasoning in AI models. Enough risks were found that maybe it shouldnt generate people or anything photorealistic.

Another red team member, who asked WIRED not to use their name due to concerns about possible retribution, said that while they found the OpenAI ethics team to be responsive to concerns, they were against releasing DALL-E 2 with the ability to generate faces. They question the rush to release technology that can automate discrimination.


I wonder why theyre releasing this model now, besides to show off their impressive technology to people, the person said. It just seems like there's so much room for harm right now, and Im not seeing enough room for good to justify it being in the world yet.


DALL-Es creators call the model experimental and not yet fit for commercial use but say it could influence industries like art, education, and marketing and help advance OpenAIs stated goal of creating artificial general intelligence. But by OpenAIs own admission, DALL-E 2 is more racist and sexist than a similar, smaller model. The companys own risks and limitations document gives examples of words like assistant and flight attendant generating images of women and words like CEO and builder almost exclusively generating images of white men. Left out of that analysis are images of people created by words like racist, savage, or terrorist.

Those text prompts and dozens of others were recommended to OpenAI by the creators of DALL-Eval, a team of researchers from the MURGe Lab at the University of North Carolina. They claim to have made the first method for evaluating multimodal AI models for reasoning and societal bias.

The DALL-Eval team found that bigger multimodal models generally have more impressive performancebut also more biased outputs. OpenAI VP of communications Steve Dowling declined to share images generated from text prompts recommended by DALL-Eval creators when WIRED requested them. Dowling said early testers werent told to avoid posting negative or racist content generated by the system. But as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a late April interview, text prompts involving people, and in particular photorealistic faces, generate the most problematic content. The 400 people with early access to DALL-E 2predominantly OpenAI employees, board members, and Microsoft employeeswere told not to share photorealistic images in public, in large part due to these issues.

The purpose of this is to learn how to eventually do faces safely if we can, which is a goal wed like to get to, says Altman.

Computer vision has a history of deploying AI first, then apologizing years later when audits reveal a history of harm. The ImageNet competition and resulting data set laid the foundation for the field in 2009 and led to the launch of a number of companies, but sources of bias in its training data led its creators to cut labels related to people in 2019. A year later, the creators of a data set called 80 Million Tiny Images took it offline after a decade of circulation, citing racial slurs and other harmful labels within the training data. Last year, MIT researchers concluded that the measurement and mitigation of bias in vision data sets is critical to building a fair society.


DALL-E 2 was trained using a combination of photos scraped from the internet and acquired from licensed sources, according to the document authored by OpenAI ethics and policy researchers. OpenAI did make efforts to mitigate toxicity or the spread of disinformation, applying text filters to the image generator and removing some images that were sexually explicit or gory. Only noncommercial use is allowed today, and early users are required to label images with a signature bar of color in the bottom-right corner generated by DALL-E 2. But the red team was not given access to the DALL-E 2 training data set.

OpenAI knows better than anyone the harm that can come from deploying AI built with massive, poorly curated data sets. Documentation by OpenAI found that its multimodal model CLIP, which plays a role in the DALL-E 2 training process, exhibits racist and sexist behavior. Using a data set of 10,000 images of faces divided into seven racial categories, OpenAI found that CLIP is more likely to misclassify Black people as less than human than any other racial group, and in some cases more likely to label the faces of men as executive or doctor than those of women.



Upon release of GPT-2 in February 2019, OpenAI adopted a staggered approach to the release of the largest form of the model on the claim that text it generated was too realistic and dangerous to release. That approach sparked debate about how to responsibly release large language models, as well as criticism that the elaborate release method was designed to drum up publicity.

Despite GPT-3 being more than 100 times larger than GPT-2with a well-documented bias toward Black people, Muslims, and other groups of peopleefforts to commercialize GPT-3 with exclusive partner Microsoft went forward in 2020 with no specific data-driven or quantitative method to determine whether the model was fit for release.

Altman suggested that DALL-E 2 may follow the same approach to GPT-3. There arent obvious metrics that we've all agreed on that we can point to that society can say this is the right way to handle this, he says, but OpenAI does want to follow metrics like the number of DALL-E 2 images that depict, say, a person of color in a jail cell.
