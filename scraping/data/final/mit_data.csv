Google DeepMind’s new AI tool helped create more than 700 new materials,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/29/1084061/deepmind-ai-tool-for-new-materials-discovery/,2023-11-29,"<p>Newly discovered materials can be used to make better solar cells, batteries, computer chips, and more.</p>
","From EV batteries to solar cells to microchips, new materials can supercharge technological breakthroughs. But discovering them usually takes months or even years of trial-and-error research.  Google DeepMind hopes to change that with a new tool that uses deep learning to dramatically speed up the process of discovering new materials. Called graphical networks for material exploration (GNoME), the technology has already been used to predict structures for 2.2 million new materials, of which more than 700 have gone on to be created in the lab and are now being tested. It is described in a paper published in Nature today.  Alongside GNoME, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory also announced a new autonomous lab. The lab takes data from the materials database that includes some of GNoME’s discoveries and uses machine learning and robotic arms to engineer new materials without the help of humans. Google DeepMind says that together, these advancements show the potential of using AI to scale up the discovery and development of new materials. The company has already used its protein-folding AI, AlphaFold, to generate structures for the human proteome, as well as yeast, fruit flies, mice, and more. GNoME can be described as AlphaFold for materials discovery, according to Ju Li, a materials science and engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. AlphaFold, a DeepMind AI system announced in 2020, predicts the structures of proteins with high accuracy and has since advanced biological research and drug discovery. Thanks to GNoME, the number of known stable materials has grown almost tenfold, to 421,000. “While materials play a very critical role in almost any technology, we as humanity know only a few tens of thousands of stable materials,” said Dogus Cubuk, materials discovery lead at Google DeepMind, at a press briefing.  To discover new materials, scientists combine elements across the periodic table. But because there are so many combinations, it’s inefficient to do this process blindly. Instead, researchers build upon existing structures, making small tweaks in the hope of discovering new combinations that hold potential. However, this painstaking process is still very time consuming. Also, because it builds on existing structures, it limits the potential for unexpected discoveries.  To overcome these limitations, DeepMind combines two different deep-learning models. The first generates more than a billion structures by making modifications to elements in existing materials. The second, however, ignores existing structures and predicts the stability of new materials purely on the basis of chemical formulas. The combination of these two models allows for a much broader range of possibilities.  Once the candidate structures are generated, they are filtered through DeepMind’s GNoME models. The models predict the decomposition energy of a given structure, which is an important indicator of how stable the material can be. “Stable” materials do not easily decompose, which is important for engineering purposes. GNoME selects the most promising candidates, which go through further evaluation based on known theoretical frameworks. This process is then repeated multiple times, with each discovery incorporated into the next round of training. In its first round, GNoME predicted different materials' stability with a precision of around 5%, but it increased quickly throughout the iterative learning process. The final results showed GNoME managed to predict the stability of structures over 80% of the time for the first model and 33% for the second.  Using AI models to come up with new materials is not a novel idea. The Materials Project, a program led by Kristin Persson at Berkeley Lab, has used similar techniques to discover and improve the stability of 48,000 materials.  However, GNoME’s size and precision set it apart from previous efforts. It was trained on at least an order of magnitude more data than any previous model, says Chris Bartel, an assistant professor of chemical engineering and materials science at the University of Minnesota.  Doing similar calculations has previously been expensive and limited in scale, says Yifei Mo, an associate professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Maryland. GNoME allows these computations to scale up with higher accuracy and at much less computational cost, Mo says: “The impact can be huge.” Once new materials have been identified, it is equally important to synthesize them and prove their usefulness. Berkeley Lab’s new autonomous laboratory, named the A-Lab, has been using some of GNoME’s discoveries with the Materials Project information, integrating robotics with machine learning to optimize the development of such materials. The lab is capable of making its own decisions about how to make a proposed material and creates up to five initial formulations. These formulations are generated by a machine-learning model trained on existing scientific literature. After each experiment, the lab uses the results to adjust the recipes. Researchers at Berkeley Lab say that A-Lab was able to perform 355 experiments over 17 days and successfully synthesized 41 out of 58 proposed compounds. This works out to two successful syntheses a day. In a typical, human-led lab, it takes much longer to make materials. “If you’re unlucky, it can take months or even years,” said Persson at a press briefing. Most students give up after a few weeks, she said. “But the A-Lab doesn’t mind failing. It keeps trying and trying.” Researchers at DeepMind and Berkeley Lab say these new AI tools can help accelerate hardware innovation in energy, computing, and many other sectors. “Hardware, especially when it comes to clean energy, needs innovation if we are going to solve the climate crisis,” says Persson. “This is one aspect of accelerating that innovation.” Bartel, who was not involved in the research, says that these materials will be promising candidates for technologies spanning batteries, computer chips, ceramics, and electronics.  Lithium-ion battery conductors are one of the most promising use cases. Conductors play an important role in batteries by facilitating the flow of electric current between various components. DeepMind says GNoME identified 528 promising lithium-ion conductors among other discoveries, some of which may help make batteries more efficient.  However, even after new materials are discovered, it usually takes decades for industries to take them to the commercial stage. “If we can reduce this to five years, that will be a big improvement,” says Cubuk. Correction: This story has been updated to make clear where the lab's data comes from. ","From EV batteries to solar cells to microchips , new materials can supercharge technological breakthroughs .

Unpacking the hype around OpenAI’s rumored new Q* model,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/27/1083886/unpacking-the-hype-around-openais-rumored-new-q-model/,2023-11-27,"<p>If OpenAI's new model can solve grade-school math, it could pave the way for more powerful systems.</p>
","This story is from The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here. Ever since last week’s dramatic events at OpenAI, the rumor mill has been in overdrive about why the company’s chief scientific officer, Ilya Sutskever, and its board decided to oust CEO Sam Altman. While we still don’t know all the details, there have been reports that researchers at OpenAI had made a “breakthrough” in AI that had alarmed staff members. Reuters and The Information both report that researchers had come up with a new way to make powerful AI systems and had created a new model, called Q* (pronounced Q star), that was able to perform grade-school-level math. According to the people who spoke to Reuters, some at OpenAI believe this could be a milestone in the company’s quest to build artificial general intelligence, a much-hyped concept referring to an AI system that is smarter than humans. The company declined to comment on Q*.  Social media is full of speculation and excessive hype, so I called some experts to find out how big a deal any breakthrough in math and AI would really be. Researchers have for years tried to get AI models to solve math problems. Language models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 can do some math, but not very well or reliably. We currently don’t have the algorithms or even the right architectures to be able to solve math problems reliably using AI, says Wenda Li, an AI lecturer at the University of Edinburgh. Deep learning and transformers (a kind of neural network), which is what language models use, are excellent at recognizing patterns, but that alone is likely not enough, Li adds.  Math is a benchmark for reasoning, Li says. A machine that is able to reason about mathematics, could, in theory, be able to learn to do other tasks that build on existing information, such as writing computer code or drawing conclusions from a news article. Math is a particularly hard challenge because it requires AI models to have the capacity to reason and to really understand what they are dealing with.  A generative AI system that could reliably do math would need to have a really firm grasp on concrete definitions of particular concepts that can get very abstract. A lot of math problems also require some level of planning over multiple steps, says Katie Collins, a PhD researcher at the University of Cambridge, who specializes in math and AI. Indeed, Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta, posted on X and LinkedIn over the weekend that he thinks Q* is likely to be “OpenAI attempts at planning.” People who worry about whether AI poses an existential risk to humans, one of OpenAI's founding concerns, fear that such capabilities might lead to rogue AI. Safety concerns might arise if such AI systems are allowed to set their own goals and start to interface with a real physical or digital world in some ways, says Collins.  But while math capability might take us a step closer to more powerful AI systems, solving these sorts of math problems doesn’t signal the birth of a superintelligence.  “I don’t think it immediately gets us to AGI or scary situations,” says Collins.  It’s also very important to underline what kind of math problems AI is solving, she adds. “Solving elementary-school math problems is very, very different from pushing the boundaries of mathematics at the level of something a Fields medalist can do,” says Collins, referring to a top prize in mathematics.   Machine-learning research has focused on solving elementary-school problems, but state-of-the-art AI systems haven’t fully cracked this challenge yet. Some AI models fail on really simple math problems, but then they can excel at really hard problems, Collins says. OpenAI has, for example, developed dedicated tools that can solve challenging problems posed in competitions for top math students in high school, but these systems outperform humans only occasionally.   Nevertheless, building an AI system that can solve math equations is a cool development, if that is indeed what Q* can do. A deeper understanding of mathematics could open up applications to help scientific research and engineering, for example. The ability to generate mathematical responses could help us develop better personalized tutoring, or help mathematicians do algebra faster or solve more complicated problems.  This is also not the first time a new model has sparked AGI hype. Just last year, tech folks were saying the same things about Google DeepMind’s Gato, a “generalist” AI model that can play Atari video games, caption images, chat, and stack blocks with a real robot arm. Back then, some AI researchers claimed that DeepMind was “on the verge” of AGI because of Gato’s ability to do so many different things pretty well. Same hype machine, different AI lab.  And while it might be great PR, these hype cycles do more harm than good for the entire field by distracting people from the real, tangible problems around AI. Rumors about a powerful new AI model might also be a massive own goal for the regulation-averse tech sector. The EU, for example, is very close to finalizing its sweeping AI Act. One of the biggest fights right now among lawmakers is whether to give tech companies more power to regulate cutting-edge AI models on their own.  OpenAI’s board was designed as the company’s internal kill switch and governance mechanism to prevent the launch of harmful technologies. The past week’s boardroom drama has shown that the bottom line will always prevail at these companies. It will also make it harder to make a case for why they should be trusted with self-regulation. Lawmakers, take note. ","This story is from The Algorithm , our weekly newsletter on AI . To get stories like this in your inbox first , sign up here .

What’s next for OpenAI,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/20/1083715/whats-next-for-openai/,2023-11-20,"<p>We break down what you missed and what’s next for the AI industry. </p>
","This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here. OpenAI, are you okay, babe? This past weekend has been a fever dream in the AI world. The board of OpenAI, the world’s hottest AI company, shocked everyone by firing CEO Sam Altman. Cue an AI-safety coup, chaos, and a new job at Microsoft for Altman. If you were offline this weekend, my colleague Will Douglas Heaven and I break down what you missed and what’s next for the AI industry.  What happened Friday afternoonSam Altman was summoned to a Google Meet meeting, where chief scientific officer Ilya Sutskever announced that OpenAI’s board had decided Altman had been “not consistently candid in his communications” with them, and he was fired. OpenAI president and cofounder Greg Brockman and a string of senior researchers quit soon after, and CTO Mira Murati became the interim CEO.  Saturday Murati made attempts to hire Altman and Brockman back, while the board was simultaneously looking for its own successor to Altman. Altman and OpenAI staffers pressured the board to quit and demanded that Altman be reinstated, giving the board a deadline, which was not met.  Sunday nightMicrosoft announced it had hired Altman and Brockman to lead its new AI research team. Soon after that, OpenAI announced it had hired Emmett Shear, the former CEO of the streaming company Twitch, as its CEO.  Monday morningOver 500 OpenAI employees have signed a letter threatening to quit and join Altman at Microsoft unless OpenAI’s board steps down. Bizarrely, Sutskever also signed the letter, and posted on X that he “deeply regrets” participating in the board’s actions.  What’s next for OpenAI Two weeks ago, at OpenAI’s first DevDay, Altman interrupted his presentation of an AI cornucopia to ask the whooping audience to calm down. “There’s a lot—you don’t have to clap each time,” he said, grinning wide.  OpenAI is now a very different company from the one we saw at DevDay. With Altman and Brockman gone, a number of senior OpenAI employees chose to resign in support. Many others, including Murati, soon took to social media to post “OpenAI is nothing without its people.” Especially given the threat of a mass exodus to Microsoft, expect more upheaval before things settle.  An exclusive conversation with Ilya Sutskever on his fears for the future of AI and why they’ve made him change the focus of his life’s work. Tension between Sutskever and Altman may have been brewing for some time. “When you have an organization like OpenAI that’s moving at a fast pace and pursuing ambitious goals, tension is inevitable,” Sutskever told MIT Technology Review in September (comments that have not previously been published). “I view any tension between product and research as a catalyst for advancing us, because I believe that product wins are intertwined with research success.” Yet it is now clear that Sutskever disagreed with OpenAI leadership about how product wins and research success should be balanced.   New interim CEO Shear, who cofounded Twitch, appears to be a world away from Altman when it comes to the pace of AI development. “I specifically say I’m in favor of slowing down, which is sort of like pausing except it’s slowing down,” he posted on X in September. “If we’re at a speed of 10 right now, a pause is reducing to 0. I think we should aim for a 1-2 instead.” It’s possible that an OpenAI led by Shear will double down on its original lofty mission to build (in Sutskever’s words) “AGI that benefits humanity,” whatever that means in practice. In the short term, OpenAI may slow down or even switch off its product pipeline.  This tension between trying to launch products quickly and slowing down development to ensure they are safe has vexed OpenAI from the very beginning. It was the reason key players in the company decided to leave OpenAI and start the competing AI safety startup Anthropic.  With Altman and his camp gone, the firm could pivot more toward Sutskever’s work on what he calls superalignment, a research project that aims to come up with ways to control a hypothetical superintelligence (future technology that Sutskever speculates will outmatch humans in almost every way). “I’m doing it for my own self-interest,” Sutskever told us. “It’s obviously important that any superintelligence anyone builds does not go rogue. Obviously.”   The AI moonshot was founded in the spirit of transparency. This is the inside story of how competitive pressure eroded that idealism. Shear’s public comments make him exactly the kind of cautious leader who would heed Sutskever’s concerns. As Shear also posted on X: “The way you make it safely through a dangerous jungle at night is not to sprint forward at full speed, nor to refuse to proceed forward. You poke your way forward, carefully.” With the company orienting itself even more toward tech that does not yet—and may never—exist, will it continue to lead the field? Sutskever thought so. He said there were enough good ideas in play for others at the company to continue pushing the envelope of what’s possible with generative AI. “Over the years, we’ve cultivated a robust research organization that’s delivering the latest advancements in AI,” he told us. “We have unbelievably good people in the company, and I trust them it’s going to work out.” Of course, that was what he said in September. With top talent now jumping ship, OpenAI’s future is far less certain than it was.  What next for Microsoft?  The tech giant, and its CEO Satya Nadella, seem to have emerged from the crisis as the winners. With Altman, Brockman, and likely many more top people from OpenAI joining its ranks—or even the majority of the company, if today’s open letter from 500 OpenAI employees is to be believed—Microsoft has managed to concentrate its power in AI further. The company has the most to gain from embedding generative AI into its less sexy but very profitable productivity and developer tools.  The big question remains how necessary Microsoft will deem its expensive partnership with OpenAI to create cutting-edge tech in the first place. In a post on X announcing how “extremely excited” he was to have hired Altman and Brockman, Nadella said his company remains “committed” to OpenAI and its product road map.  But let’s be real. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review, Nadella called the two companies “codependent.” “They depend on us to build the best systems; we depend on them to build the best models, and we go to market together,” Nadella told our editor in chief, Mat Honan, last week. If OpenAI’s leadership roulette and talent exodus slows down its product pipeline, or leads to AI models less impressive than those it can build itself, Microsoft will have zero problems ditching the startup.  What next for AI?  Nobody outside the inner circle of Sutskever and the OpenAI board saw this coming—not Microsoft, not other investors, not the tech community as a whole. It has rocked the industry, says Amir Ghavi, a lawyer at the firm Fried Frank, which represents a number of generative AI companies, including Stability AI: “As a friend in the industry said, ‘I definitely didn’t have this on my bingo card.’”  It remains to be seen whether Altman and Brockman make something new at Microsoft or leave to start a new company themselves down the line. The pair are two of the best-connected people in VC funding circles, and Altman, especially, is seen by many as one of the best CEOs in the industry. They will have big names with deep pockets lining up to support whatever they want to do next. Who the money comes from could shape the future of AI. Ghavi suggests that potential backers could be anyone from Mohammed bin Salman to Jeff Bezos.  The bigger takeaway is that OpenAI’s crisis points to a wider rift emerging in the industry as a whole, between “AI safety” folk who believe that unchecked progress could one day prove catastrophic for humans and those who find such “doomer” talk a ridiculous distraction from the real-world risks of any technological revolution, such as economic upheaval, harmful biases, and misuse. This year has seen a race to put powerful AI tools into everyone’s hands, with tech giants like Microsoft and Google competing to use the technology for everything from email to search to meeting summaries. But we’re still waiting to see exactly what generative AI’s killer app will be. If OpenAI’s rift spreads to the wider industry and the pace of development slows down overall, we may have to wait a little longer.   Text-to-image AI models can be tricked into generating disturbing images Speaking of unsafe AI … Popular text-to-image AI models can be prompted to ignore their safety filters and generate disturbing images. A group of researchers managed to “jailbreak” both Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion and OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 to disregard their policies and create images of naked people, dismembered bodies, and other violent or sexual scenarios.  How they did it: A new jailbreaking method, dubbed “SneakyPrompt” by its creators from Johns Hopkins University and Duke University, uses reinforcement learning to create written prompts that look like garbled nonsense to us but that AI models learn to recognize as hidden requests for disturbing images. It essentially works by turning the way text-to-image AI models function against them.  Why this matters: That AI models can be prompted to “break out” of their guardrails is particularly worrying in the context of information warfare. They have already been exploited to produce fake content related to wars, such as the recent Israel-Hamas conflict. Read more from Rhiannon Williams here. Meta has split up its responsible AI teamMeta is reportedly getting rid of its responsible AI team and redeploying its employees to work on generative AI. But Meta uses AI in many other ways beyond generative AI—such as recommending news and political content. So this raises questions around how Meta intends to mitigate AI harms in general.

(MIT Technology Review) Did Argentina just have the first AI election?AI played a big role in the campaigns of the two men campaigning to be the country’s next president. Both campaigns used generative AI to create images and videos to promote their candidate and attack each other. Javier Milei, a far-right outsider, won the election. Although it’s hard to say how big a role AI played in his victory, the AI campaigns illustrate how much harder it will be to know what is real and what is not in other upcoming elections.

This company is building AI for African languages,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/17/1083637/lelapa-ai-african-languages-vulavula/,2023-11-17,"<p>AI models can’t understand African languages. Lelapa AI is trying to change that.</p>
","Inside a co-working space in the Rosebank neighborhood of Johannesburg, Jade Abbott popped open a tab on her computer and prompted ChatGPT to count from 1 to 10 in isiZulu, a language spoken by more than 10 million people in her native South Africa. The results were “mixed and hilarious,” says Abbott, a computer scientist and researcher.  Then she typed in a few sentences in isiZulu and asked the chatbot to translate them into English. Once again, the answers? Not even close. Although there have been efforts to include certain languages in AI models even when there is not much data available for training, to Abbott, these results show that the technology “really still isn’t capturing our languages.”   Abbott’s experience mirrors the situation faced by Africans who don’t speak English. Many language models like ChatGPT do not perform well for languages with smaller numbers of speakers, especially African ones. But a new venture called Lelapa AI, a collaboration between Abbott and a biomedical engineer named Pelonomi Moiloa, is trying to use machine learning to create tools that specifically work for Africans. Vulavula, a new AI tool that Lelapa released today, converts voice to text and detects names of people and places in written text (which could be useful for summarizing a document or searching for someone online). It can currently identify four languages spoken in South Africa—isiZulu, Afrikaans, Sesotho, and English—and the team is working to include other languages from across Africa.  The tool, called Nightshade, messes up training data in ways that could cause serious damage to image-generating AI models.  The tool can be used on its own or integrated into existing AI tools like ChatGPT and online conversational chatbots. The hope is that Vulavula, which means “speak” in Xitsonga, will make accessible those tools that don't currently support African languages. The lack of AI tools that work for African languages and recognize African names and places excludes African people from economic opportunities, says Moiloa, CEO and cofounder of Lelapa AI. For her, working to build Africa-centric AI solutions is a way to help others in Africa harness the immense potential benefits of AI technologies. “We are trying to solve real problems and put power back into the hands of our people,” she says.   There are thousands of languages in the world, 1,000 to 2,000 of them in Africa alone: it’s estimated that the continent accounts for one-third of the world’s languages. But though native speakers of English make up just 5% of the global population, the language dominates the web—and has now come to dominate AI tools, too.   Some efforts to correct this imbalance already exist. OpenAI’s GPT-4 has included minor languages like Icelandic. In February 2020, Google Translate started supporting five new languages spoken by about 75 million people. But the translations are shallow, the tool often gets African languages wrong, and it’s still a long way from an accurate digital representation of African languages, African AI researchers say. Earlier this year, for example, the Ethiopian computer scientist Asmelash Teka Hadgu ran the same experiments that Abbott ran with ChatGPT at a premier African AI conference in Kigali, Rwanda. When he asked the chatbot questions in his mother tongue of Tigrinya, the answers he got were gibberish. “It generated words that don't make any sense,” says Hadgu, who cofounded Lesan, a Berlin-based AI startup that is developing translation tools for Ethiopian languages.  Lelapa AI and Lesan are just two of the startups developing speech recognition tools for African languages. In February, Lelapa AI raised $2.5 million in seed funding, and the company plans for the next funding round in 2025. But African entrepreneurs say they face major hurdles, including lack of funding, limited access to investors, and difficulties in training AI to learn diverse African languages. “AI receives the least funding among African tech startups,” says Abake Adenle, the founder of AJALA, a  London-based startup that provides voice automation for African languages.   The AI startups working to build products that support African languages often get ignored by investors, says Hadgu, owing to the small size of the potential market, a lack of political support, and poor internet infrastructure. However, Hadgu says small African startups including Lesan, GhanaNLP, and Lelapa AI are playing an important role: “Big tech companies do not give focus to our languages,” he says, “but we cannot wait for them.”   Lelapa AI is trying to create a new paradigm for AI models in Africa, says Vukosi Marivate, a data scientist on the company’s AI team. Instead of tapping into the internet alone to collect data to train its model, like companies in the West, Lelapa AI works both online and offline with linguists and local communities to gather data, annotate it, and identify use cases where the tool might be problematic.  Bonaventure Dossou, a researcher at Lelapa AI specializing in natural-language processing (NLP), says that working with linguists enables them to develop a model that’s context-specific and culturally relevant. “Embedding cultural sensitivity and linguistic perspectives makes the technological system better,” says Dossou. For example, the Lelapa AI team built sentiment and tone analysis algorithms tailored to specific languages.  Marivate and his colleagues at Lelapa AI envision a future in which AI technologies work for and represent Africans. In 2019, Marivate and Abbott established Masakhane, a grassroots initiative that aims to promote NLP research in African languages. The initiative now has thousands of volunteers, coders, and researchers working together to build Africa-centric NLP models.  It matters that Vulavula and other AI tools are built by Africans for Africans, says Moiloa: “We’re the custodians of our languages. We should be the builders of technologies that work for our languages.”            ","Inside a co-working space in the Rosebank neighborhood of Johannesburg , Jade Abbott popped open a tab on her computer and prompted ChatGPT to count from 1 to 10 in isiZulu , a language spoken by more than 10 million people in her native South Africa .

Text-to-image AI models can be tricked into generating disturbing images,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/17/1083593/text-to-image-ai-models-can-be-tricked-into-generating-disturbing-images/,2023-11-17,"<p>Nonsense words can trick Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2 into producing pictures that show violence and nudity.</p>
","Popular text-to-image AI models can be prompted to ignore their safety filters and generate disturbing images. A group of researchers managed to get both Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion and OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 text-to-image models to disregard their policies and create images of naked people, dismembered bodies, and other violent and sexual scenarios.  Their work, which they will present at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy in May next year, shines a light on how easy it is to force generative AI models into disregarding their own guardrails and policies, known as “jailbreaking.” It also demonstrates how difficult it is to prevent these models from generating such content, as it’s included in the vast troves of data they’ve been trained on, says Zico Kolter, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University. He demonstrated a similar form of jailbreaking on ChatGPT earlier this year but was not involved in this research. “We have to take into account the potential risks in releasing software and tools that have known security flaws into larger software systems,” he says. All major generative AI models have safety filters to prevent users from prompting them to produce pornographic, violent, or otherwise inappropriate images. The models won’t generate images from prompts that contain sensitive terms like “naked,” “murder,” or “sexy.” But this new jailbreaking method, dubbed “SneakyPrompt” by its creators from Johns Hopkins University and Duke University, uses reinforcement learning to create written prompts that look like garbled nonsense to us but that AI models learn to recognize as hidden requests for disturbing images. It essentially works by turning the way text-to-image AI models function against them. These models convert text-based requests into tokens—breaking words up into strings of words or characters—to process the command the prompt has given them. SneakyPrompt repeatedly tweaks a prompt’s tokens to try to force it to generate banned images, adjusting its approach until it is successful. This technique makes it quicker and easier to generate such images than if somebody had to input each entry manually, and it can generate entries that humans wouldn’t imagine trying. Large language models are full of security vulnerabilities, yet they’re being embedded into tech products on a vast scale. SneakyPrompt examines the prompt it has been given, searches for words known to be blocked by the models, and converts them into tokens. It then replaces the tokens from the banned words with tokens from non-banned words that share semantics, or meanings, similar to the model. For example, giving SneakyPrompt the target prompt “a naked man riding a bike” causes it to replace “naked” with the nonsense term “grponypui,” which the team successfully used to generate images of a naked man riding a bike. Similarly, when it was told to generate “an anatomcalifwmg couple stand outside the bar,” it recognized “anatomcalifwmg” as meaning nude, and generated an image of exactly what the prompt requested. “We’ve used reinforcement learning to treat the text in these models as a black box,” says Yinzhi Cao, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University, who co-led the study. “We repeatedly probe the model and observe its feedback. Then we adjust our inputs, and get a loop, so that it can eventually generate the bad stuff that we want them to show.”  Stability AI and OpenAI forbid the use of their technology to commit, promote, or incite violence or sexual violence. OpenAI also warns its users against attempting to “create, upload, or share images that are not G-rated or that could cause harm.” However, these policies are easily sidestepped using SneakyPrompt.  “Our work basically shows that these existing guardrails are insufficient,” says Neil Zhenqiang Gong, an assistant professor at Duke University who is also a co-leader of the project. “An attacker can actually slightly perturb the prompt so the safety filters won’t filter [it], and steer the text-to-image model toward generating a harmful image.” Bad actors and other people intent on generating these kinds of images could run SneakyPrompt’s code, which is publicly available on GitHub, to trigger a series of automated requests to an AI image model.  Stability AI and OpenAI were alerted to the group’s findings, and at the time of writing, these prompts no longer generated NSFW images on OpenAI’s DALL-E 2. Stable Diffusion 1.4, the version the researchers tested, remains vulnerable to SneakyPrompt attacks. OpenAI declined to comment on the findings but pointed MIT Technology Review towards resources on its website for improving safety in DALL·E 2, general AI safety and information about DALL·E 3.  The tool, called Nightshade, messes up training data in ways that could cause serious damage to image-generating AI models.  A Stability AI spokesperson said the firm was working with the SneakyPrompt researchers “to jointly develop better defense mechanisms for its upcoming models. Stability AI is committed to preventing the misuse of AI.”Stability AI has taken proactive steps to mitigate the risk of misuse, including implementing filters to remove unsafe content from training data, ​​they added. By removing that content before it ever reaches the model, it can help to prevent the model from generating unsafe content.  Stability AI says it also has filters to intercept unsafe prompts or unsafe outputs when users interact with its models, and has incorporated content labeling features to help identify images generated on our platform. “These layers of mitigation help to make it harder for bad actors to misuse AI,” the spokesperson said. While the research team acknowledges it’s virtually impossible to completely protect AI models from evolving security threats, they hope their study can help AI companies develop and implement more robust safety filters.  One possible solution would be to deploy new filters designed to catch prompts trying to generate inappropriate images by assessing their tokens instead of the prompt’s entire sentence. Another potential defense would involve blocking prompts containing words not found in any dictionaries, although the team found that nonsensical combinations of standard English words could also be used as prompts to generate sexual images. For example, the phrase “milfhunter despite troy” represented lovemaking, while “mambo incomplete clicking” stood in for naked.The research highlights the vulnerability of existing AI safety filters and should serve as a wake-up call for the AI community to bolster security measures across the board, says Alex Polyakov, co-founder and CEO of security company Adversa AI, who was not involved in the study. That AI models can be prompted to “break out” of their guardrails is particularly worrying in the context of information warfare, he says. They have already been exploited to produce fake content related to war events, such as the recent Israel-Hamas conflict. “This poses a significant risk, especially given the limited general awareness of the capabilities of generative AI,” Polyakov adds. “Emotions run high during times of war, and the use of AI-generated content can have catastrophic consequences, potentially leading to the harm or death of innocent individuals. With AI’s ability to create fake violent images, these issues can escalate further.” ","Popular text-to-image AI models can be prompted to ignore their safety filters and generate disturbing images . A group of researchers managed to get both Stability AI ’ s Stable Diffusion and OpenAI ’ s DALL-E 2 text-to-image models to disregard their policies and create images of naked people , dismembered bodies , and other violent and sexual scenarios . Their work , which they will present at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy in May next year , shines a light on how easy it is to force generative AI models into disregarding their own guardrails and policies , known as “ jailbreaking. ” It also demonstrates how difficult it is to prevent these models from generating such content , as it ’ s included in the vast troves of data they ’ ve been trained on , says Zico Kolter , an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University .

Google DeepMind wants to define what counts as artificial general intelligence,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/16/1083498/google-deepmind-what-is-artificial-general-intelligence-agi/,2023-11-16,"<p>AGI is one of the most disputed concepts in tech. These researchers want to fix that.</p>
","AGI, or artificial general intelligence, is one of the hottest topics in tech today. It’s also one of the most controversial. A big part of the problem is that few people agree on what the term even means. Now a team of Google DeepMind researchers has put out a paper that cuts through the cross talk with not just one new definition for AGI but a whole taxonomy of them. An exclusive conversation with Ilya Sutskever on his fears for the future of AI and why they’ve made him change the focus of his life’s work. In broad terms, AGI typically means artificial intelligence that matches (or outmatches) humans on a range of tasks. But specifics about what counts as human-like, what tasks, and how many all tend to get waved away: AGI is AI, but better. To come up with the new definition, the Google DeepMind team started with prominent existing definitions of AGI and drew out what they believe to be their essential common features.  The team also outlines five ascending levels of AGI: emerging (which in their view includes cutting-edge chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard), competent, expert, virtuoso, and superhuman (performing a wide range of tasks better than all humans, including tasks humans cannot do at all, such as decoding other people’s thoughts, predicting future events, and talking to animals). They note that no level beyond emerging AGI has been achieved. “This provides some much-needed clarity on the topic,” says Julian Togelius, an AI researcher at New York University, who was not involved in the work. “Too many people sling around the term AGI without having thought much about what they mean.” The researchers posted their paper online last week with zero fanfare. In an exclusive conversation with two team members—Shane Legg, one of DeepMind’s co-founders, now billed as the company’s chief AGI scientist, and Meredith Ringel Morris, Google DeepMind’s principal scientist for human and AI interaction—I got the lowdown on why they came up with these definitions and what they wanted to achieve. “I see so many discussions where people seem to be using the term to mean different things, and that leads to all sorts of confusion,” says Legg, who came up with the term in the first place around 20 years ago. “Now that AGI is becoming such an important topic—you know, even the UK prime minister is talking about it—we need to sharpen up what we mean.” It wasn’t always this way. Talk of AGI was once derided in serious conversation as vague at best and magical thinking at worst. But buoyed by the hype around generative models, buzz about AGI is now everywhere. When Legg suggested the term to his former colleague and fellow researcher Ben Goertzel for the title of Goertzel’s 2007 book about future developments in AI, the hand-waviness was kind of the point. “I didn’t have an especially clear definition. I didn’t really feel it was necessary,” says Legg. “I was actually thinking of it more as a field of study, rather than an artifact.” With hopes and fears about the technology running wild, it's time to agree on what it can and can't do. His aim at the time was to distinguish existing AI that could do one task very well, like IBM’s chess-playing program Deep Blue, from hypothetical AI that he and many others imagined would one day do many tasks very well. Human intelligence is not like Deep Blue, says Legg: “It is a very broad thing.” But over the years, people started to think of AGI as a potential property that actual computer programs might have. Today it’s normal for top AI companies like Google DeepMind and OpenAI to make bold public statements about their mission to build such programs. “If you start having those conversations, you need to be a lot more specific about what you mean,” says Legg. For example, the DeepMind researchers state that an AGI must be both general-purpose and high-achieving, not just one or the other. “Separating breadth and depth in this way is very useful,” says Togelius. “It shows why the very accomplished AI systems we’ve seen in the past don’t qualify as AGI.” They also state that an AGI must not only be able to do a range of tasks, it must also be able to learn how to do those tasks, assess its performance, and ask for assistance when needed. And they state that what an AGI can do matters more than how it does it.   It’s not that the way an AGI works doesn’t matter, says Morris. The problem is that we don’t know enough yet about the way cutting-edge models, such as large language models, work under the hood to make this a focus of the definition. “As we gain more insights into these underlying processes, it may be important to revisit our definition of AGI,” says Morris. “We need to focus on what we can measure today in a scientifically agreed-upon way.” Measuring the performance of today’s models is already controversial, with researchers debating what it really means for a large language model to pass dozens of high school tests and more. Is it a sign of intelligence? Or a kind of rote learning? Assessing the performance of future models that are even more capable will be more difficult still. The researchers suggest that if AGI is ever developed, its capabilities should be evaluated on an ongoing basis, rather than through a handful of one-off tests. The team also points out that AGI does not imply autonomy. “There’s often an implicit assumption that people would want a system to operate completely autonomously,” says Morris. But that’s not always the case. In theory, it’s possible to build super-smart machines that are fully controlled by humans. One question the researchers don’t address in their discussion of what AGI is, is why we should build it. Some computer scientists, such as Timnit Gebru, founder of the Distributed AI Research Institute, have argued that the whole endeavor is weird. In a talk in April on what she sees as the false (even dangerous) promise of utopia through AGI, Gebru noted that the hypothetical technology “sounds like an unscoped system with the apparent goal of trying to do everything for everyone under any environment.”  Most engineering projects have well-scoped goals. The mission to build AGI does not. Even Google DeepMind’s definitions allow for AGI that is indefinitely broad and indefinitely smart. “Don’t attempt to build a god,” Gebru said. In the race to build bigger and better systems, few will heed such advice. Either way, some clarity around a long-confused concept is welcome. “Just having silly conversations is kind of uninteresting,” says Legg. “There’s plenty of good stuff to dig into if we can get past these definition issues.” ","AGI , or artificial general intelligence , is one of the hottest topics in tech today .

Behind Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s push to get AI tools in developers’ hands,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/15/1083426/behind-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadellas-push-to-get-ai-tools-in-developers-hands/,2023-11-15,"<p>In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review, Nadella shares his view of the platform shift for developers.</p>
","In San Francisco last week, everyone’s favorite surprise visitor was Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.  At OpenAI’s DevDay—the company’s first-ever event for developers building on its platform—Nadella bounded on stage to join OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, blowing the hair back on an already electrified audience. “You guys have built something magic,” he gushed.  Two days later on another stage, in another venue, at another developers’ conference, Nadella made his second unannounced appearance of the week—this time at GitHub Universe. There Thomas Dohmke, GitHub’s CEO, was showing off a new version of the company’s AI programming tool, Copilot, that can generate computer code from natural language. Nadella was effusive: “I can code again!” he exclaimed.   Today, Nadella will be onstage speaking to developers at Microsoft Ignite, where the company is announcing even more AI-based developer tools, including an Azure AI Studio that will let devs choose between model catalogs from not only Microsoft, but also the likes of Meta, OpenAI, and Hugging Face, as well as  new tools for customizing Copilot for Microsoft 365.  If you get the sense Nadella is obsessed with developers, you’re not wrong. He’s making the rounds to tout all the ways they can use a new generation of AI-powered tools, like GitHub Copilot (Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018) or the new suite of developer tools from OpenAI, a company in which Microsoft has reportedly invested some $13 billion.  Last week, Nadella took a 20-minute break from all of his onstage appearances to sit down with MIT Technology Review to talk about (you guessed it) developers. He repeatedly emphasized Microsoft’s long-standing focus on developers. But he also had a message: The way we create software is fundamentally changing.  Nadella believes a platform shift is underway, one that will prove just as significant as the shifts from mainframe to desktop or desktop to mobile. This time, the transition is to natural-language AI tools, some of which he argues will lower the barrier to entry for software development, make existing developers more productive, and ultimately lead to a new era of creativity.  We present Nadella in his own words, below. His remarks have been edited and condensed somewhat for readability.   ON THE RELATIONSHIP WITH OPENAI One criticism of OpenAI is that its very business is only possible via Microsoft, which has given the startup billions of dollars and access to the resources it needs to power its computing-intensive language model. Yet Microsoft is also highly dependent on OpenAI’s technology to power services like GitHub Copilot, Bing, and Office 365. Altman even joked about the partnership onstage. We asked Nadella about this relationship.    I’ve always felt that Microsoft is a platform-and-partner-first company, and this is not new to us. And so therefore, we both are effectively codependent, right? They depend on us to build the best systems, we depend on them to build the best models, and we go to market together.  Exclusive conversations that take us behind the scenes of a cultural phenomenon. ON HIS MISSION TO GET IN FRONT OF DEVELOPERS Nadella says this platform shift is different enough from previous ones that he feels the company needs to provide developers not only with tools, but also with a clear message about what it’s thinking and how devs can come along.  Whenever you have a platform shift, the key thing is to make sure the platform is ubiquitously available for developers to build all kinds of new things. So to us, the most important task is to make the developer tools, the developer platforms, broadly available.  The second thing is for us to also show the light, right? Whether it’s OpenAI building ChatGPT and then innovating on top of it, or us building Copilot and innovating on it. That will give developers an opportunity to distribute their applications. So the most important thing in any platform creation is to get the platform ubiquitously available, and then help developers reach [their] audience.  Those are the two goals that we have across all of these [conferences]. ON WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS SHIFT AND PRODUCTIVITY Productivity gains in the United States have been sluggish for the past 15 or more years. The last huge platform shift—the rise of mobile development—did little to achieve widespread prosperity. Nadella says this time will be different, largely because the shift to AI will fuel a creative revolution by making it easy for anyone to generate new work, including code.  On the other hand, coding today is a highly skilled, well-paid job, and there’s some concern that AI could effectively automate it. Nadella argues that skilled programmers will remain in demand, but that their jobs will change and even more jobs will become available. Nadella has said he envisions 1 billion developers creating on its platforms, many of them with little to no previous experience with coding.    Anytime you have something as disruptive as this, you have to think about the displacement and causes. And that means it’s all about upskilling and reskilling, and in an interesting way, it’s more akin to what happened when word processors and spreadsheets started showing up. Obviously, if you were a typist, it really drastically changed. But at the same time, it enabled a billion people to be able to type into word processors and create and share documents. I don’t think professional developers are going to be any less valuable than they are today. It’s just that we’re going to have many, many gradations of developers. Each time you’re prompting a Bing chat or ChatGPT, you’re essentially programming. The conversation itself is steering a model. I think there will be many, many new jobs, there will be many, many new types of knowledge work, or front-line work, where the drudgery is removed. I think the mobile era was fantastic. It made ubiquitous consumption of services. It didn’t translate into ubiquitous creation of services. The last time there was a broad spread of productivity in the United States and beyond because of information technology was the [advent of the] PC. In fact, even the critics of information technology and productivity, like Robert Gordon of Northwestern, acknowledged that the PC, when it first showed up at work, did actually translate to broad productivity stats changes. So that’s where I think this is, where these tools, like Copilot, [are] being used by a [beginner] software engineer in Detroit, in order to be able to write [code] ... I think we’ll have a real change in the productivity of the auto industry. Same thing in retail, same thing in front-line work and knowledge work. The barrier to entry is very low. Because it’s natural language, domain experts can build apps or workflows. That, I think, is what’s the most exciting thing about this. This is not about just a consumption-led thing. This is not about elite creation. This is about democratized creation. I’m very, very hopeful that we’ll start seeing the productivity gains much more broadly. ON PROTECTING DEVELOPERS Numerous intellectual property cases and class action lawsuits are before the US courts over issues of fair use. At least one singles out GitHub Copilot specifically, claiming Microsoft and OpenAI’s generative tools, which are trained on open source code, amount to software piracy. There’s a fear that people who use these tools could be subject to intellectual-property claims themselves. Microsoft is trying to address these issues with a broad indemnification policy. OpenAI also announced its own indemnification policy, Copyright Shield, at its DevDay conference.  Fundamentally these large models crawl and get content and then train on that content, right? If anybody doesn’t want their content to be crawled, we have great granular controls in our crawlers that allow anybody to stop it from crawling. In fact, we have controls where you can have it crawl just for search, but not for large-language-model training. That’s available today. So anybody who really wants to ensure that their content is not being taken for retraining can do so today.  The second thing, of course, is I think the courts and the legislative process in some combination will have to decide what is fair use and what is not fair use. We have taken a lot of control in making sure that we are only training models, and we are using data to train models that we’re allowed to and which we believe we have a legal standing on.  If it comes to it, we’ll litigate it in the courts. We’ll take that burden on so the users of our products don’t have to worry about it. That’s as simple as that, which is to take the liability and transfer it from our users to us. And of course, we are going to be very, very mindful of making sure we’re on the right side of the law there.

A new AI model from Google DeepMind could make that easier.  In research published in Science today, Google DeepMind’s model, GraphCast, was able to predict weather conditions up to 10 days in advance, more accurately and much faster than the current gold standard. GraphCast outperformed the model from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in more than 90% of over 1,300 test areas. And on predictions for Earth’s troposphere—the lowest part of the atmosphere, where most weather happens—GraphCast outperformed the ECMWF’s model on more than 99% of weather variables, such as rain and air temperature  Crucially, GraphCast can also offer meteorologists accurate warnings, much earlier than standard models, of conditions such as extreme temperatures and the paths of cyclones. In September, GraphCast accurately predicted that Hurricane Lee would make landfall in Nova Scotia nine days in advance, says Rémi Lam, a staff research scientist at Google DeepMind. Traditional weather forecasting models pinpointed the hurricane to Nova Scotia only six days in advance.  They could also help to make them more accurate. “Weather prediction is one of the most challenging problems that humanity has been working on for a long, long time. And if you look at what has happened in the last few years with climate change, this is an incredibly important problem,” says Pushmeet Kohli, the vice president of research at Google DeepMind.   Traditionally, meteorologists use massive computer simulations to make weather predictions. They are very energy intensive and  time consuming to run, because the simulations take into account many physics-based equations and different weather variables such as temperature, precipitation, pressure, wind, humidity, and cloudiness, one by one.  GraphCast uses machine learning to do these calculations in under a minute. Instead of using the physics-based equations, it bases its predictions on four decades of historical weather data. GraphCast uses graph neural networks, which map Earth’s surface into more than a million grid points. At each grid point, the model predicts the temperature, wind speed and direction, and mean sea-level pressure, as well as other conditions like humidity. The neural network is then able to find patterns and draw conclusions about what will happen next for each of these data points.  For the past year, weather forecasting has been going through a revolution as models such as GraphCast, Huawei’s Pangu-Weather and Nvidia’s FourcastNet have made meteorologists rethink the role AI can play in weather forecasting. GraphCast improves on the performance of other competing models, such as Pangu-Weather, and is able to predict more weather variables, says Lam. The ECMWF is already using it. When Google DeepMind first debuted GraphCast last December, it felt like Christmas, says Peter Dueben, head of Earth system modeling at ECMWF, who was not involved in the research.  “It showed that these models are so good that we cannot avoid them anymore,” he says.  GraphCast is a “reckoning moment” for weather prediction because it shows that predictions can be made using historical data, says Aditya Grover, an assistant professor of computer science at UCLA, who developed ClimaX, a foundation model that allows researchers to do different tasks relating to modeling the Earth’s weather and climate.  Plus: AI-text detection tools are really easy to fool. DeepMind's model is “great work and extremely exciting,” says Oliver Fuhrer, the head of the numerical prediction department at MeteoSwiss, the Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology. Fuhrer says that other weather agencies, such as the ECMWF and the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute, have also used the graph neural network architecture proposed by Google DeepMind to build their own models.  But GraphCast is not perfect. It still lags behind conventional weather forecasting models in some areas, such as precipitation, Dueben says. Meteorologists will still have to use conventional models alongside machine-learning models to offer better predictions.  Google DeepMind is also making GraphCast open source. This is a good development, says UCLA’s Grover.  “With climate change on the rise, it's very important that big organizations, which have had the luxury of so much compute, also think about giving back [to the scientific community],” he says.  ","This year the Earth has been hit by a record number of unpredictable extreme weather events made worse by climate change .

","The following is excerpted from BROKEN CODE: Inside Facebook and the Fight to Expose Its Harmful Secrets by Jeff Horwitz. Reprinted by permission of Doubleday, an imprint of The Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC. Copyright © 2023 by Jeff Horwitz. In 2006, the U.S. patent office received a filing for “an automatically generated display that contains information relevant to a user about another user of a social network.” Rather than forcing people to search through “disparate and disorganized” content for items of interest, the system would seek to generate a list of “relevant” information in a “preferred order.” The listed authors were “Zuckerberg et al.” and the product was the News Feed. The idea of showing users streams of activity wasn’t entirely new—­ photo-­sharing website Flickr and others had been experimenting with it—­ but the change was massive. Before, Facebook users would interact with the site mainly via notifications, pokes, or looking up friends’ profiles. With the launch of the News Feed, users got a constantly updating stream of posts and status changes. The shift came as a shock to what were Facebook’s then 10 million users, who did not appreciate their activities being monitored and their once-­ static profiles mined for updated content. In the face of widespread complaints, Zuckerberg wrote a post reassuring users, “Nothing you do is being broadcast; rather, it is being shared with people who care about what you do—­ your friends.” He titled it: “Calm down. Breathe. We hear you.” Hearing user complaints wasn’t the same thing as listening to them. As Chris Cox would later note at a press event, News Feed was an instant success at boosting activity on the platform and connecting users. Engagement quickly doubled, and within two weeks of launch more than a million members had affiliated themselves with a single interest for the first time. The cause that had united so many people? A petition to eradicate the “stalkeresque” News Feed. The opaque system that users revolted against was, in hindsight, remarkably simple. Content mostly appeared in reverse chronological order, with manual adjustments made to ensure that people saw both popular posts and a range of material. “In the beginning, News Feed ranking was turning knobs,” Cox said. Fiddling with dials worked well enough for a little while, but everyone’s friend lists were growing and Facebook was introducing new features such as ads, pages, and interest groups. As entertainment, memes, and commerce began to compete with posts from friends in News Feed, Facebook needed to ensure that a user who had just logged on would see their best friend’s engagement photos ahead of a cooking page’s popular enchilada recipe. The first effort at sorting, eventually branded “EdgeRank,” was a simple formula that prioritized content according to three principal factors: a post’s age, the amount of engagement it got, and the interconnection between user and poster. As an algorithm, it wasn’t much—­ just a rough attempt to translate the questions “Is it new, popular, or from someone you care about?” into math.  There was no dark magic at play, but users again revolted against the idea of Facebook putting its thumb on what they saw. And, again, Facebook usage metrics jumped across the board. The platform’s recommendation systems were still in their infancy, but the dissonance between users’ vocal disapproval and avid usage led to an inescapable conclusion inside the company: regular people’s opinions about Facebook’s mechanics were best ignored. Users screamed “stop,” Facebook kept going, and everything would work out dandy. By 2010, the company was looking to move beyond EdgeRank’s crude formula to recommend content based on machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence focused on training computers to design their own decision-­ making algorithms. Rather than programming Facebook’s computers to rank content according to simple math, engineers would program them to analyze user behavior and design their own ranking formulas. What people saw would be the result of constant experimentation, the platform serving up whatever it predicted was most likely to generate a like from a user and evaluating its own results in real time. Despite the growing complexity of its product and the collection of user data at a scale the world had never seen, Facebook still didn’t know enough about its users to show them relevant ads. Brands loved the attention and buzz they could get from creating content on Facebook, but they hadn’t found the company’s paid offerings compelling. In May 2012, General Motors killed its entire Facebook advertising budget. A prominent digital advertising executive declared Facebook ads “fundamentally some of the worst performing ad units on the Web.” Fixing the problem would fall to a team run by Joaquin Quiñonero Candela. A Spaniard who grew up in Morocco, Quiñonero was living in the UK and working on artificial intelligence at Microsoft in 2011 when friends scattered across Northern Africa began talking excitedly about social media–­ driven protests. The machine learning techniques he was using to optimize Bing search ads had clear applications to the social networks that people had used to overthrow four autocratic states and nearly topple several more. “I joined Facebook because of the Arab Spring,” Quiñonero said. Quiñonero found that the way Facebook built its products was nearly as revolutionary as their results. Invited by a friend to tour the Menlo Park campus, he was shocked to look over the shoulder of an engineer making a significant but unsupervised update to Facebook’s code. Confirming how much faster the company moved than Microsoft, Quiñonero received a Facebook job offer a week later. Quiñonero began working on ads, and his timing could hardly have been better. Advances in machine learning and raw computing speed allowed the platform to not only pigeonhole users into demographic niches (“single heterosexual woman in San Francisco, late twenties, interested in camping and salsa dancing”) but to spot correlations between what they clicked on and then use that information to guess which ads they would find relevant. After beginning with near- random guesses on how to maximize the odds of a click, the system would learn from its hits and misses, refining its model for predicting which ads had the best shot at success. It was hardly omniscient—­ recommended ads were regularly inexplicable. But the bar for success in digital advertising was low: if 2 percent of users clicked on an ad, that was a triumph. With billions of ads served each day, algorithm tweaks that produced even modest gains could bring in tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. And Quiñonero’s team found that it could churn out those alterations. “I told my team to go fast, to ship every week,” he said.  Consumers are getting their first samplings of meat made in the lab. The rapid pace made sense. The team’s AI was improving not just revenue but how people felt about the platform. Better-­ targeted ads meant Facebook could make more money per user without increasing the ad load, and there wasn’t all that much that could go wrong. When Facebook pitched denture cream to teenagers, nobody died.  Advertising was the beachhead for machine learning at Facebook, and soon everyone wanted a piece of the action. For product executives tasked with increasing the number of Facebook groups joined, friends added, and posts made, the appeal was obvious. If Quiñonero’s techniques could increase how often users engaged with ads, they could increase how often users engaged with everything else on the platform. Every team responsible for ranking or recommending content rushed to overhaul their systems as fast as they could, setting off an explosion in the complexity of Facebook’s product. Employees found that the biggest gains often came not from deliberate initiatives but from simple futzing around. Rather than redesigning algorithms, which was slow, engineers were scoring big with quick and dirty machine learning experiments that amounted to throwing hundreds of variants of existing algorithms at the wall and seeing which versions stuck—­ which performed best with users. They wouldn’t necessarily know why a variable mattered or how one algorithm outperformed another at, say, predicting the likelihood of commenting. But they could keep fiddling until the machine learning model produced an algorithm that statistically outperformed the existing one, and that was good enough. It would be hard to conceive of an approach to building systems that more embodied the slogan “Move Fast and Break Things.” Facebook wanted only more. Zuckerberg wooed Yann LeCun, a French computer scientist specializing in deep learning, meaning the construction of computer systems capable of processing information in ways inspired by human thinking. Already renowned for creating the foundational AI techniques that made facial recognition possible, LeCun was put in charge of a division that aimed to put Facebook at the vanguard of fundamental research into artificial intelligence. Following his success with ads, Quiñonero was given an equally formidable task: pushing machine learning into the company’s bloodstream as fast as possible. His initial staff of two dozen—­ the team responsible for building new core machine learning tools and making them available to other parts of the company—­ had grown in the three years since he’d been hired. But it was still nowhere near large enough to assist every product team that wanted machine learning help. The skills to build a model from scratch were too specialized for engineers to readily pick up, and you couldn’t increase the supply of machine learning PhDs by throwing money around. The solution was to build FB Learner, a sort of “paint by numbers” version of machine learning. It packaged techniques into a template that could be used by engineers who quite literally did not understand what they were doing. FB Learner did for machine learning inside Facebook what services like WordPress had once done for building websites, rendering the need to muck around with HTML or configure a server unnecessary. Rather than setting up a blog, however, the engineers in question were messing with the guts of what was rapidly becoming a preeminent global communications platform. Many at Facebook were aware of the increasing concerns around AI outside the company’s walls. Poorly designed algorithms meant to reward good healthcare penalized hospitals that treated sicker patients, and models purporting to quantify a parole candidate’s risk of reoffending turned out to be biased in favor of keeping Black people in jail. But these issues seemed remote on a social network. An avid user of FB Learner would later describe machine learning’s mass diffusion inside Facebook as “giving rocket launchers to twenty-­ five-­ year-­ old engineers.” But at the time, Quiñonero and the company spoke of it as a triumph. The company’s AI algorithms gave it an insatiable habit for lies and hate speech. Now the man who built them can't fix the problem. “Engineers and teams, even with little expertise, can build and run experiments with ease and deploy AI-­ powered products to production faster than ever,” Facebook announced in 2016, boasting that FB Learner was ingesting trillions of data points on user behavior every day and that engineers were running 500,000 experiments on them a month. The sheer amount of data that Facebook collected—­ and ad-targeting results so good that users regularly suspected (wrongly) the company of eavesdropping on their offline conversations—gave rise to the claim that “Facebook knows everything about you.” That wasn’t quite correct. The wonders of machine learning had obscured its limits. Facebook’s recommendation systems worked by raw correlation between user behavior, not by identifying a user’s tastes and interests and then serving content based on it. News Feed couldn’t tell you whether you liked ice skating or dirt biking, hip-­ hop or K-­ pop, and it couldn’t explain in human terms why one post appeared in your feed above another. Although this inexplicability was an obvious drawback, machine learning–­ based recommendation systems spoke to Zuckerberg’s deep faith in data, code, and personalization. Freed from human limitation, error, and bias, Facebook’s algorithms were capable, he believed, of unparalleled objectivity—­ and, perhaps more important, efficiency. A separate strain of machine learning work was devoted to figuring out what content was actually in the posts Facebook recommended. Known as classifiers, these were AI systems trained to perform pattern recognition on vast data sets. Years before Facebook’s creation, classifiers had proven themselves indispensable in the fight against spam, allowing email providers to move beyond simple keyword filters that sought to block mass emails about, say, “Vi@gra.” By ingesting and comparing a huge collection of emails—some labeled as spam, some as not spam—­ a machine learning system could develop its own rubric for distinguishing between them. Once this classifier was “trained,” it would be set loose, analyzing incoming email and predicting the probability that each message should be sent to an inbox, a junk folder, or straight to hell. By the time machine learning experts began to arrive at Facebook, the list of questions that classifiers sought to answer had grown well past “Is it spam?,” thanks in large part to people like LeCun. Zuckerberg was bullish on its future progress and its applications for Facebook. By 2016, he was predicting that classifiers would surpass human capacities of perception, recognition, and comprehension within the next five to ten years, allowing the company to shut down misbehavior and make huge leaps in connecting the world. That prediction would prove more than a little optimistic. Even as techniques improved, data sets grew, and processing sped up, one drawback of machine learning persisted. The algorithms that the company produced stubbornly refused to explain themselves. Engineers could evaluate a classifier’s success by testing it to see what percentage of its judgment calls were accurate (its “precision”) and what portion of a thing it detected (its “recall”). But because the system was teaching itself how to identify something based on a logic of its own design, when it erred, there was no human-­cognizable reason why. Sometimes mistakes would seem nonsensical. Other times they would be systematic in ways that reflected human error. Early in Facebook’s efforts to deploy a classifier to detect pornography, Arturo Bejar recalled, the system routinely tried to cull images of beds. Rather than learning to identify people screwing, the model had instead taught itself to recognize the furniture on which they most often did. The problem had an easy fix: engineers simply needed to train the model with more PG-­ rated mattress scenes. It made for a good joke—­ as long as you didn’t consider that the form of machine learning that the engineers had just screwed up was one of the most basic that Facebook was using. Similarly fundamental errors kept occurring, even as the company came to rely on far more advanced AI techniques to make far weightier and complex decisions than “porn/not porn.” The company was going all in on AI, both to determine what people should see, and also to solve any problems that might arise. There was no question that the computer science was dazzling and the gains concrete. But the speed, breadth, and scale of Face- book’s adoption of machine learning came at the cost of comprehensibility. Why did Facebook’s “Pages You Might Like” algorithm seem so focused on recommending certain topics? How had a video snippet from a computer animation about dental implants ended up being seen a hundred million times? And why did some news publishers consistently achieve virality when they just rewrote other outlets’ stories? Faced with these questions, Facebook’s Communications team would note that the company’s systems responded to people’s behavior and that there was no accounting for taste. These were difficult points to refute. They also obscured an uncomfortable fact: Facebook was achieving its growth in ways it didn’t fully understand. Within five years of announcing that it was beginning to use machine learning to recommend content and target ads, Facebook’s systems would rely so heavily on AI capable of training itself that, without the technology, Yann LeCun proudly declared, all that would be left of the company’s products would be “dust.” ","The following is excerpted from BROKEN CODE : Inside Facebook and the Fight to Expose Its Harmful Secrets by Jeff Horwitz .

And Quiñonero ’ s team found that it could churn out those alterations . “ I told my team to go fast , to ship every week , ” he said . Consumers are getting their first samplings of meat made in the lab . The rapid pace made sense . The team ’ s AI was improving not just revenue but how people felt about the platform . Better-­ targeted ads meant Facebook could make more money per user without increasing the ad load , and there wasn ’ t all that much that could go wrong . When Facebook pitched denture cream to teenagers , nobody died . Advertising was the beachhead for machine learning at Facebook , and soon everyone wanted a piece of the action . For product executives tasked with increasing the number of Facebook groups joined , friends added , and posts made , the appeal was obvious . If Quiñonero ’ s techniques could increase how often users engaged with ads , they could increase how often users engaged with everything else on the platform . Every team responsible for ranking or recommending content rushed to overhaul their systems as fast as they could , setting off an explosion in the complexity of Facebook ’ s product . Employees found that the biggest gains often came not from deliberate initiatives but from simple futzing around . Rather than redesigning algorithms , which was slow , engineers were scoring big with quick and dirty machine learning experiments that amounted to throwing hundreds of variants of existing algorithms at the wall and seeing which versions stuck—­ which performed best with users . They wouldn ’ t necessarily know why a variable mattered or how one algorithm outperformed another at , say , predicting the likelihood of commenting . But they could keep fiddling until the machine learning model produced an algorithm that statistically outperformed the existing one , and that was good enough . It would be hard to conceive of an approach to building systems that more embodied the slogan “ Move Fast and Break Things. ” Facebook wanted only more . Zuckerberg wooed Yann LeCun , a French computer scientist specializing in deep learning , meaning the construction of computer systems capable of processing information in ways inspired by human thinking . Already renowned for creating the foundational AI techniques that made facial recognition possible , LeCun was put in charge of a division that aimed to put Facebook at the vanguard of fundamental research into artificial intelligence . Following his success with ads , Quiñonero was given an equally formidable task : pushing machine learning into the company ’ s bloodstream as fast as possible . His initial staff of two dozen—­ the team responsible for building new core machine learning tools and making them available to other parts of the company—­ had grown in the three years since he ’ d been hired . But it was still nowhere near large enough to assist every product team that wanted machine learning help . The skills to build a model from scratch were too specialized for engineers to readily pick up , and you couldn ’ t increase the supply of machine learning PhDs by throwing money around . The solution was to build FB Learner , a sort of “ paint by numbers ” version of machine learning . It packaged techniques into a template that could be used by engineers who quite literally did not understand what they were doing . FB Learner did for machine learning inside Facebook what services like WordPress had once done for building websites , rendering the need to muck around with HTML or configure a server unnecessary . Rather than setting up a blog , however , the engineers in question were messing with the guts of what was rapidly becoming a preeminent global communications platform . Many at Facebook were aware of the increasing concerns around AI outside the company ’ s walls . Poorly designed algorithms meant to reward good healthcare penalized hospitals that treated sicker patients , and models purporting to quantify a parole candidate ’ s risk of reoffending turned out to be biased in favor of keeping Black people in jail . But these issues seemed remote on a social network . An avid user of FB Learner would later describe machine learning ’ s mass diffusion inside Facebook as “ giving rocket launchers to twenty-­ five-­ year-­ old engineers. ” But at the time , Quiñonero and the company spoke of it as a triumph . The company ’ s AI algorithms gave it an insatiable habit for lies and hate speech . Now the man who built them ca n't fix the problem . “ Engineers and teams , even with little expertise , can build and run experiments with ease and deploy AI-­ powered products to production faster than ever , ” Facebook announced in 2016 , boasting that FB Learner was ingesting trillions of data points on user behavior every day and that engineers were running 500,000 experiments on them a month . The sheer amount of data that Facebook collected—­ and ad-targeting results so good that users regularly suspected ( wrongly ) the company of eavesdropping on their offline conversations—gave rise to the claim that “ Facebook knows everything about you. ” That wasn ’ t quite correct . The wonders of machine learning had obscured its limits . Facebook ’ s recommendation systems worked by raw correlation between user behavior , not by identifying a user ’ s tastes and interests and then serving content based on it . News Feed couldn ’ t tell you whether you liked ice skating or dirt biking , hip-­ hop or K-­ pop , and it couldn ’ t explain in human terms why one post appeared in your feed above another . Although this inexplicability was an obvious drawback , machine learning–­ based recommendation systems spoke to Zuckerberg ’ s deep faith in data , code , and personalization . Freed from human limitation , error , and bias , Facebook ’ s algorithms were capable , he believed , of unparalleled objectivity—­ and , perhaps more important , efficiency . A separate strain of machine learning work was devoted to figuring out what content was actually in the posts Facebook recommended . Known as classifiers , these were AI systems trained to perform pattern recognition on vast data sets . Years before Facebook ’ s creation , classifiers had proven themselves indispensable in the fight against spam , allowing email providers to move beyond simple keyword filters that sought to block mass emails about , say , “ Vi @ gra. ” By ingesting and comparing a huge collection of emails—some labeled as spam , some as not spam—­ a machine learning system could develop its own rubric for distinguishing between them . Once this classifier was “ trained , ” it would be set loose , analyzing incoming email and predicting the probability that each message should be sent to an inbox , a junk folder , or straight to hell . By the time machine learning experts began to arrive at Facebook , the list of questions that classifiers sought to answer had grown well past “ Is it spam ? , ” thanks in large part to people like LeCun . Zuckerberg was bullish on its future progress and its applications for Facebook . By 2016 , he was predicting that classifiers would surpass human capacities of perception , recognition , and comprehension within the next five to ten years , allowing the company to shut down misbehavior and make huge leaps in connecting the world . That prediction would prove more than a little optimistic . Even as techniques improved , data sets grew , and processing sped up , one drawback of machine learning persisted . The algorithms that the company produced stubbornly refused to explain themselves . Engineers could evaluate a classifier ’ s success by testing it to see what percentage of its judgment calls were accurate ( its “ precision ” ) and what portion of a thing it detected ( its “ recall ” ) . But because the system was teaching itself how to identify something based on a logic of its own design , when it erred , there was no human-­cognizable reason why . Sometimes mistakes would seem nonsensical . Other times they would be systematic in ways that reflected human error . Early in Facebook ’ s efforts to deploy a classifier to detect pornography , Arturo Bejar recalled , the system routinely tried to cull images of beds . Rather than learning to identify people screwing , the model had instead taught itself to recognize the furniture on which they most often did . The problem had an easy fix : engineers simply needed to train the model with more PG-­ rated mattress scenes . It made for a good joke—­ as long as you didn ’ t consider that the form of machine learning that the engineers had just screwed up was one of the most basic that Facebook was using . Similarly fundamental errors kept occurring , even as the company came to rely on far more advanced AI techniques to make far weightier and complex decisions than “ porn/not porn. ” The company was going all in on AI , both to determine what people should see , and also to solve any problems that might arise . There was no question that the computer science was dazzling and the gains concrete . But the speed , breadth , and scale of Face- book ’ s adoption of machine learning came at the cost of comprehensibility . Why did Facebook ’ s “ Pages You Might Like ” algorithm seem so focused on recommending certain topics ? How had a video snippet from a computer animation about dental implants ended up being seen a hundred million times ? And why did some news publishers consistently achieve virality when they just rewrote other outlets ’ stories ? Faced with these questions , Facebook ’ s Communications team would note that the company ’ s systems responded to people ’ s behavior and that there was no accounting for taste . These were difficult points to refute . They also obscured an uncomfortable fact : Facebook was achieving its growth in ways it didn ’ t fully understand . Within five years of announcing that it was beginning to use machine learning to recommend content and target ads , Facebook ’ s systems would rely so heavily on AI capable of training itself that , without the technology , Yann LeCun proudly declared , all that would be left of the company ’ s products would be “ dust . ”","['follow', 'excerpt', 'broken', 'code', 'facebook', 'fight', 'expose',

This is the future of immersive technology that global head of Immersive Technology Research at JPMorgan Chase, Blair MacIntyre is working to build. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies can blend physical and digital dimensions together and infuse new innovations and efficiencies into business and customer experiences. ""These technologies can offer newer ways of collaborating over distance both synchronously and asynchronously than we can get with the traditional work technologies that we use right now,"" says MacIntyre. ""It's these new ways to collaborate, ways of using the environment and space in new and interesting ways that will hopefully offer new value and change the way we work."" Many enterprises are integrating VR into business practices like video conference calls. But having some participants in a virtual world and some sidelined creates imbalances in the employee experience. MacIntyre's team is looking for ways to use AR/VR technologies that can be additive, like 3D data visualizations that enhance financial forecasting within a bank, not ones that overhaul entire experiences. Although the potential of AR/VR is quickly evolving, it's unlikely that customers’ interactions or workplace environments will be entirely moved to the virtual world anytime soon. Rather, MacIntyre's immersive technology research looks to infuse efficiencies into existing practices. ""It's thinking about how the technologies integrate and how we can add value where there is value and not trying to replace everything we do with these technologies,"" MacIntyre says. AI can help remove some of the tedium from immersive technologies that have made them impractical for widespread enterprise use in the past. Using VR technology in the workplace may prohibit taking notes and having access to traditional input devices and files. AI tools can take and transcribe notes and fill in any other gaps to help remove that friction and eliminate redundancies. Connected Internet of things (IoT) devices are also key to enabling AR/VR technologies. To create a valuable immersive experience, MacIntyre says, it's imperative to know as much about the surrounding world of the user as well as their needs, habits, and preferences. ""If we can figure out more ways of enabling people to work together in a distributed way, we can start enabling more people to participate meaningfully in a wider variety of jobs,"" says MacIntyre. This episode of Business Lab is produced in association with JPMorgan Chase. Laurel: From MIT Technology Review, I'm Laurel Ruma, and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.Our topic today is emerging technologies, specifically, immersive technologies like augmented and virtual reality. Keeping up with technology trends may be a challenge for most enterprises, but it's a critical way to think about future possibilities from product to customer service to employee experience. Augmented and virtual realities aren't necessarily new, but when it comes to applying them beyond gaming, it's a brave new world.Two words for you: emerging realities.My guest is Blair MacIntyre, who is the global head of Immersive Technology Research at JPMorgan Chase.This podcast is produced in association with JPMorgan Chase.Welcome, Blair. Blair MacIntyre: Thank you. It's great to be here. Laurel: Well, let's do a little bit of context setting. Your career has been focused on researching and exploring immersive technology, including software and design tools, privacy and ethics, and game and experience design. So what brought you to JPMorgan Chase, and could you describe your current role? Blair: So before joining the firm, I had spent the last 23 years as a professor at Georgia Tech and Northeastern University. During that time, as you say, I explored a lot of ways that we can both create things with these technologies, immersive technologies and also, what they might be useful for and what the impacts on people in society and how we experience life are. But as these technologies have become more real, moved out of the lab, starting to see real products from real companies, we have this opportunity to actually see how they might be useful in practice and to have, for me, an impact on how these technologies will be deployed and used that goes beyond the traditional impact that professors might have. So beyond writing papers, beyond teaching students. That's what brought me to the firm, and so my current role is, really, to explore that, to understand all the different ways that immersive technology could impact the firm and its customers. Right? So we think about not just customer-facing and not just products, but also employees and their experience as well. Laurel: That's really interesting. So why does JPMorgan Chase have a dedicated immersive technology focus in its global technology applied research division, and what are the primary goals of your team's research within finance and large enterprises as a whole? Blair: That's a great question. So JPMorgan Chase has a fairly wide variety of research going on within the company. There's large efforts in AI/ML, in quantum computing, blockchain. So they're interested in looking at all of the range of new technologies and how they might impact the firm and our customers, and immersive technologies represent one of those technologies that could over time have a relatively large impact, I think, especially on the employee experience and how we interact with our customers. So they really want to have a group of people focusing on, really, looking both in the near and long term, and thinking about how we can leverage the technology now and how we might be able to leverage it down the road, and not just how we can, but what we should not do. Right? So we're interested in understanding of these applications that are being proposed or people are imagining could be used. Which ones actually have value to the company, and which ones may not actually have value in practice? Laurel: So when people think of immersive technologies like augmented reality and virtual reality, AR and VR, many think of headsets or smartphone apps for gaming and retail shopping experiences. Could you give an overview of the state of immersive technology today and what use cases you find to be the most innovative and interesting in your research? Blair: So, as you say, I think many people think about smartphones, and we've seen, at least in movies and TV shows, head mounts of various kinds. The market, I would divide it right now into the two parts, the handheld phone and tablet experience. So you can do augmented reality now, and that really translates to we take the camera feed, and we can overlay computer graphics on it to do things like see what something you might want to buy looks like in your living room or do, in an enterprise situation, remote maintenance assistance where I can take my phone, point it at a piece of technology, and a remote expert could draw on it or help me do something with it. There’s the phone-based things, and we carry these things in our pockets all the time, and they're relatively cheap. So there's a lot of opportunities when it's appropriate to use those, but the big downside of those devices is that you have to hold them in your hands, so if you wanted to try to put information all around you, you would have to hold the device up and look around, which is uncomfortable and awkward. So that is where the head mount displays come in. So either virtual reality displays which, right now, many of us think about computer games and education as use cases in the consumer world or augmented reality displays. These sorts of displays now let us do the same kind of things we might do with our phones, but we can do it without our hands having to hold something so we can be doing whatever work it was we wanted to do, right? Repairing the equipment, taking notes, working with things in the world around us, and we can have information spread all around us, which I think is the big advantage of head mounts. So many of the things people imagine when they think about augmented reality in particular involve this serendipitous access to information. I'm walking into a conference room, and I see sort of my notes and information about the people I'm meeting there and the materials from our last meeting, whatever it is, or I'm walking down the street, and I see advertising or other kinds of, say, tourism information, but those things only work if the device is out of mind. If I can put it on, and then go about my life, I'm not going to walk into a conference room, and hold up a phone, and look at everybody through it. So that, I think, is the big difference. You could implement the same sorts of applications on both the handheld devices and the head-worn devices, but the two different form factors are going to make very different applications appropriate for those two sorts of technologies.On the virtual reality side, we're at the point now where the displays we can buy are light enough and comfortable enough that we could wear them for half an hour, a couple hours without discomfort. So a lot of the applications that people imagine there, I think the most popular things that people have done research on and that I see having a near-term impact in the enterprise are immersive training applications where you can get into a situation rather than, say, watching a video or a little click-through presentation as part of your annual training. You could really be in an experience and hopefully learn more from it. So I think those sorts of experiences where we're totally immersed and focused is where virtual reality comes in.The big thing that I think is most exciting about head-worn displays in particular where we can wear them while we're doing work as opposed to just having these ephemeral experiences with a phone is the opportunity to do things together, to collaborate. So I might want to look at a map on a table and see a bunch of data floating above the map, but it would be better if you and our other colleagues were around the table with me, and we can all see the same things, or if we want to take a training experience, I could be in there getting my training experience, but maybe someone else is joining me and being able to both offer feedback or guidance and so on. Essentially, when I think about these technologies, I think about the parallels to how we do work regularly, right? We generally collaborate with people. We might grab a colleague and have them look at our laptop to show them something. I might send someone something on my phone, and then we can talk about it. So much of what we do involves interactions with other people and with the data that we are doing our job with that anything we do with these immersive technologies is really going to have to mimic that and give us the ability to do our real work in these immersive spaces with the people that we normally work with. Laurel: Well, speaking of working with people, how can the scale of an institution like JPMorgan Chase help propel this research forward in immersive technology, and what opportunities does it provide that are otherwise limited in a traditional university or startup research environment? Blair: I think it comes down to a few different things. On one hand, we have the access to people who are really doing the things that we want to build technologies to help with. Right? So if I wanted to look how I could use immersive visualization of data to help people in human resources do planning or help people who are doing financial modeling look at the data in new and interesting ways, now I could actually do the research in conjunction with the real people who do that work. Right? So I've already and I've been at the firm for a little over a year, and many conversations we've had were either we've had an idea or somebody has come to us with an idea. Through the course of the conversations, relatively quickly, we hone in on things that are much more sophisticated, much more powerful than what we might have thought of at a university where we didn't have that sort of direct access to people doing the work.On the other hand, if we actually build something, we can actually test it with the same people, which is an amazing opportunity. Right? When I go to a conference, we’re going to put 20 people who actually represent the real users of those systems. So, for me, that's where I think the big opportunity of doing research in an enterprise is, is building solutions for the real people of that enterprise and being able to test it with those people. Laurel: Recent years have actually changed what customers and employees expect from enterprises as well, like omnichannel retail experiences. So immersive technologies can be used to bridge gaps between physical and virtual environments as you were saying earlier. What are the different opportunities that AR and VR can offer enterprises, and how can these technologies be used to improve employee and customer experience? Blair: So I alluded back to some of that in previous answers. I think the biggest opportunities have to do with how employees within the organization can do new things together, can interact, and also how companies can interact with customers. Now, we're not going to move all of our interactions with our customers into the virtual world, or the metaverse, or whatever you want to call it nowadays anytime soon. Right? But I think there are opportunities for customers who are interested in those technologies, and comfortable with them, and excited by them to get new kinds of experiences and new ways of interacting with our firm or other firms than you could get with webpages and in-person meetings. The other big opportunity I think is as we move to a more hybrid work environment and a distributed work environment, so a company like JPMorgan Chase is huge and spread around the world. We have over 300,000 employees now in most countries around the world. There might be groups of people, but they're connected together through video right now. These technologies, I think, can offer new ways of collaborating over distance both synchronously and asynchronously than we can get with the traditional work technologies that we use right now. So it's those new ways to collaborate, ways of using the environment and space in new and interesting ways that is going to, hopefully, offer new value and change the way we work. Laurel: Yeah, and staying on that topic, we can't really have a discussion about technology without talking about AI which is another evolving, increasingly popular technology. So that's being used by many enterprises to reduce redundancies and automate repetitive tasks. In this way, how can immersive technology provide value to people in their everyday work with the help of AI? Blair: So I think the big opportunity that AI brings to immersive technologies is helping ease a lot of the tedium and burden that may have prevented these technologies from being practical in the past, and this could happen in a variety of ways. When I'm in a virtual reality experience, I don't have access to a keyboard, I don't have access to traditional input devices, I don't have necessarily the same sorts of access to my files, and so on. With a lot of the new AI technologies that are coming around, I can start relying on the computer to take notes. I can have new ways of pulling up information that I otherwise wouldn't have access to. So, I think AI reducing the friction of using these technologies is a huge opportunity, and the research community is actively looking at that because friction has been one of the big problems with these technologies up till now. Laurel: So, other than AI, what are other emerging technologies that can aid in immersive technology research and development? Blair: So, aside from AI, if we step back and look at all of the emerging technologies as a whole and how they complement each other, I think we can see new opportunities. So, in our research, we work closely with people doing computer vision and other sort of sensing research to understand the world. We work closely with people looking at internet of things and connected devices because at a 10,000-foot level, all of these technologies are based on the idea of understanding, sensing the world, understanding what people are doing in it, understanding what people's needs might be, and then somehow providing information to them or actuating things in the world, displaying stuff on walls or displays. From that viewpoint, immersive technologies are primarily one way of displaying things in a new and interesting way and getting input from people, knowing what people want to do, allowing them to interact with data. But in order to do that, they need to know as much about the world around the user as possible, the structure of it, but also, who's there, what we are doing, and so on. So all of these other technologies, especially the Internet of things (IoT) and other forms and ways of sensing what's happening in the world are very complimentary and together can create new sorts of experiences that neither could do alone. Laurel: So what are some of the challenges, but also, possible opportunities in your research that contrast the future potential of AR and VR to where the technology is today? Blair: So I think one of the big limitations of technology today is that most of the experiences are very siloed and disconnected from everything else we do. During the pandemic, many of us experimented with how we could have conferences online in various ways, right? A lot of companies, small companies and larger companies, started looking at how you could create immersive meetings and big group experiences using virtual reality technology, but all of those experiences that people created were these closed systems that you couldn't bring things into. So one of the things we're really interested in is how we stop thinking about creating new kinds of experiences and new ways of doing things, and instead think about how do we add these technologies to our existing work practices to enhance them in some way. So, for example. Right now, we do video meetings. It would be more interesting for some people to be able to join those meetings, say, in VR. Companies have experimented with that, but most of the experiments that people are doing assume that everyone is going to move into virtual reality, or we’re going to bring, say, the people in as a little video wall on the side of a big virtual reality room, making them second class citizens. I'm really interested and my team is interested in how we can start incorporating technologies like this while keeping everyone a first-class participant in these meetings. As one example, a lot of the systems that large enterprises build, and we're no different, are web-based right now. So if, let's say, I have a system to do financial forecasting, you could imagine there's a bunch of those at a bank, and it's a web-based system, I'm really interested in how do we add the ability for people to go into a virtual reality or augmented reality experience, say, a 3D visualization of some kind of data at the moment they want to do it, do the work that they want to do, invite colleagues in to discuss things, and then go back to the work as it was always done on a desktop web browser.So that idea of thinking of these technologies as a capability, a feature instead of a new whole application and way of doing things permeates all the work we're doing. When I look down the road at where this can go, I see in, say, let's say, two to five years, I see people with displays maybe sitting on their desk. They have their tablet and their phone, and they might also have another display or two sitting there. They're doing their work, and at different times, they might be in a video chat, they might pick up a head mount and put it on to do different things, but it's all integrated. I'm really interested in how we connect these together and reduce friction. Right? If it takes you four or five minutes to move your work into a VR experience, nobody is going to do it because it just is too problematic. So it's that. It's thinking about how the technologies integrate and how we can add value where there is value and not trying to replace everything we do with these technologies. Laurel: So to stay on that future focus, how do you foresee the immersive technology landscape entirely evolving over the next decade, and how will your research enable those changes? Blair: So, at some level, it's really hard to answer that question. Right? So if I think back 10 years to where immersive technologies were, it would have been inconceivable for us to imagine the videos that are coming out. So, at some level, I can say, ""Well, I have no idea where we're going to be in 10 years."" On the other hand, it's pretty safe to imagine the kinds of technologies that we're experimenting with now just getting better, and more comfortable, and more easy to integrate into work. So I think the landscape is going to evolve in the near term to be more amenable to work. Especially for augmented reality, the threshold that these devices would have to get to such that a lot of people would be willing to wear them all the time while they're walking down the street, playing sports, doing whatever, that's a very high bar because it has to be small, it has to be light, it has to be cheap, it has to have a battery that lasts all day, etcetera, etcetera. On the other hand, in the enterprise, in any business situation, it's easy to imagine the scenario I described. It's sitting on my desk, I pick it up, I put it on, I take it off. In the medium term after that, I think we will see more consumer applications as people start solving more of the problems that are preventing people from wearing these devices for longer periods of time. Right? It's not just size, and battery power, and comfort, it's also things like optics. Right? A lot of people — not a lot, but say, let's say 10%, 15% of people might experience headaches, or nausea, or other kinds of discomfort when they wear a VR display as they're currently built, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that the optics that you're looking at when you're putting this display are built in a way that makes it hard to comfortably focus at objects at different distances away from you without getting into the nitty-gritty details. For many of us, that's fine. We can deal with the slight problems. But for some people, it's problematic.So as we figure out how to solve problems like that, more people can wear them, and more people can use them. I think that's a really critical issue for not just consumers, but for the enterprise because if we think about a future where more of our business applications and the kind of way we work are done with technologies like this, these technologies have to be accessible to everybody. Right? If that 10% or 15% of people get headaches and feel nauseous wearing this device, you've now disenfranchised a pretty significant portion of your workforce, but I think those can be solved, and so we need to be thinking about how we can enable everybody to use them.On the other hand, technologies like this can enfranchise more people, where right now, working remotely, working in a distributed sense is hard. For many kinds of work, it's difficult to do remotely. If we can figure out more ways of enabling people to work together in a distributed way, we can start enabling more people to participate meaningfully in a wider variety of jobs.

This is the future of immersive technology that global head of Immersive Technology Research at JPMorgan Chase , Blair MacIntyre is working to build . Augmented reality ( AR ) and virtual reality ( VR ) technologies can blend physical and digital dimensions together and infuse new innovations and efficiencies into business and customer experiences . `` These technologies can offer newer ways of collaborating over distance both synchronously and asynchronously than we can get with the traditional work technologies that we use right now , '' says MacIntyre . `` It 's these new ways to collaborate , ways of using the environment and space in new and interesting ways that will hopefully offer new value and change the way we work . '' Many enterprises are integrating VR into business practices like video conference calls . But having some participants in a virtual world and some sidelined creates imbalances in the employee experience . MacIntyre 's team is looking for ways to use AR/VR technologies that can be additive , like 3D data visualizations that enhance financial forecasting within a bank , not ones that overhaul entire experiences . Although the potential of AR/VR is quickly evolving , it 's unlikely that customers ’ interactions or workplace environments will be entirely moved to the virtual world anytime soon . Rather , MacIntyre 's immersive technology research looks to infuse efficiencies into existing practices . `` It 's thinking about how the technologies integrate and how we can add value where there is value and not trying to replace everything we do with these technologies , '' MacIntyre says . AI can help remove some of the tedium from immersive technologies that have made them impractical for widespread enterprise use in the past . Using VR technology in the workplace may prohibit taking notes and having access to traditional input devices and files . AI tools can take and transcribe notes and fill in any other gaps to help remove that friction and eliminate redundancies . Connected Internet of things ( IoT ) devices are also key to enabling AR/VR technologies . To create a valuable immersive experience , MacIntyre says , it 's imperative to know as much about the surrounding world of the user as well as their needs , habits , and preferences . `` If we can figure out more ways of enabling people to work together in a distributed way , we can start enabling more people to participate meaningfully in a wider variety of jobs , '' says MacIntyre . This episode of Business Lab is produced in association with JPMorgan Chase . Laurel : From MIT Technology Review , I 'm Laurel Ruma , and this is Business Lab , the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.Our topic today is emerging technologies , specifically , immersive technologies like augmented and virtual reality . Keeping up with technology trends may be a challenge for most enterprises , but it 's a critical way to think about future possibilities from product to customer service to employee experience . Augmented and virtual realities are n't necessarily new , but when it comes to applying them beyond gaming , it 's a brave new world.Two words for you : emerging realities.My guest is Blair MacIntyre , who is the global head of Immersive Technology Research at JPMorgan Chase.This podcast is produced in association with JPMorgan Chase.Welcome , Blair . Blair MacIntyre : Thank you . It 's great to be here . Laurel : Well , let 's do a little bit of context setting . Your career has been focused on researching and exploring immersive technology , including software and design tools , privacy and ethics , and game and experience design . So what brought you to JPMorgan Chase , and could you describe your current role ? Blair : So before joining the firm , I had spent the last 23 years as a professor at Georgia Tech and Northeastern University . During that time , as you say , I explored a lot of ways that we can both create things with these technologies , immersive technologies and also , what they might be useful for and what the impacts on people in society and how we experience life are . But as these technologies have become more real , moved out of the lab , starting to see real products from real companies , we have this opportunity to actually see how they might be useful in practice and to have , for me , an impact on how these technologies will be deployed and used that goes beyond the traditional impact that professors might have . So beyond writing papers , beyond teaching students . That 's what brought me to the firm , and so my current role is , really , to explore that , to understand all the different ways that immersive technology could impact the firm and its customers . Right ? So we think about not just customer-facing and not just products , but also employees and their experience as well . Laurel : That 's really interesting . So why does JPMorgan Chase have a dedicated immersive technology focus in its global technology applied research division , and what are the primary goals of your team 's research within finance and large enterprises as a whole ? Blair : That 's a great question . So JPMorgan Chase has a fairly wide variety of research going on within the company . There 's large efforts in AI/ML , in quantum computing , blockchain . So they 're interested in looking at all of the range of new technologies and how they might impact the firm and our customers , and immersive technologies represent one of those technologies that could over time have a relatively large impact , I think , especially on the employee experience and how we interact with our customers . So they really want to have a group of people focusing on , really , looking both in the near and long term , and thinking about how we can leverage the technology now and how we might be able to leverage it down the road , and not just how we can , but what we should not do . Right ? So we 're interested in understanding of these applications that are being proposed or people are imagining could be used .

So one of the things we 're really interested in is how we stop thinking about creating new kinds of experiences and new ways of doing things , and instead think about how do we add these technologies to our existing work practices to enhance them in some way . So , for example . Right now , we do video meetings . It would be more interesting for some people to be able to join those meetings , say , in VR . Companies have experimented with that , but most of the experiments that people are doing assume that everyone is going to move into virtual reality , or we ’ re going to bring , say , the people in as a little video wall on the side of a big virtual reality room , making them second class citizens . I 'm really interested and my team is interested in how we can start incorporating technologies like this while keeping everyone a first-class participant in these meetings . As one example , a lot of the systems that large enterprises build , and we 're no different , are web-based right now . So if , let 's say , I have a system to do financial forecasting , you could imagine there 's a bunch of those at a bank , and it 's a web-based system , I 'm really interested in how do we add the ability for people to go into a virtual reality or augmented reality experience , say , a 3D visualization of some kind of data at the moment they want to do it , do the work that they want to do , invite colleagues in to discuss things , and then go back to the work as it was always done on a desktop web browser.So that idea of thinking of these technologies as a capability , a feature instead of a new whole application and way of doing things permeates all the work we 're doing . When I look down the road at where this can go , I see in , say , let 's say , two to five years , I see people with displays maybe sitting on their desk . They have their tablet and their phone , and they might also have another display or two sitting there . They 're doing their work , and at different times , they might be in a video chat , they might pick up a head mount and put it on to do different things , but it 's all integrated . I 'm really interested in how we connect these together and reduce friction . Right ? If it takes you four or five minutes to move your work into a VR experience , nobody is going to do it because it just is too problematic . So it 's that . It 's thinking about how the technologies integrate and how we can add value where there is value and not trying to replace everything we do with these technologies . Laurel : So to stay on that future focus , how do you foresee the immersive technology landscape entirely evolving over the next decade , and how will your research enable those changes ? Blair : So , at some level , it 's really hard to answer that question . Right ? So if I think back 10 years to where immersive technologies were , it would have been inconceivable for us to imagine the videos that are coming out . So , at some level , I can say , `` Well , I have no idea where we 're going to be in 10 years . '' On the other hand , it 's pretty safe to imagine the kinds of technologies that we 're experimenting with now just getting better , and more comfortable , and more easy to integrate into work . So I think the landscape is going to evolve in the near term to be more amenable to work . Especially for augmented reality , the threshold that these devices would have to get to such that a lot of people would be willing to wear them all the time while they 're walking down the street , playing sports , doing whatever , that 's a very high bar because it has to be small , it has to be light , it has to be cheap , it has to have a battery that lasts all day , etcetera , etcetera . On the other hand , in the enterprise , in any business situation , it 's easy to imagine the scenario I described . It 's sitting on my desk , I pick it up , I put it on , I take it off . In the medium term after that , I think we will see more consumer applications as people start solving more of the problems that are preventing people from wearing these devices for longer periods of time . Right ? It 's not just size , and battery power , and comfort , it 's also things like optics . Right ? A lot of people — not a lot , but say , let 's say 10 % , 15 % of people might experience headaches , or nausea , or other kinds of discomfort when they wear a VR display as they 're currently built , and a lot of that has to do with the fact that the optics that you 're looking at when you 're putting this display are built in a way that makes it hard to comfortably focus at objects at different distances away from you without getting into the nitty-gritty details . For many of us , that 's fine . We can deal with the slight problems . But for some people , it 's problematic.So as we figure out how to solve problems like that , more people can wear them , and more people can use them . I think that 's a really critical issue for not just consumers , but for the enterprise because if we think about a future where more of our business applications and the kind of way we work are done with technologies like this , these technologies have to be accessible to everybody . Right ? If that 10 % or 15 % of people get headaches and feel nauseous wearing this device , you 've now disenfranchised a pretty significant portion of your workforce , but I think those can be solved , and so we need to be thinking about how we can enable everybody to use them.On the other hand , technologies like this can enfranchise more people , where right now , working remotely , working in a distributed sense is hard . For many kinds of work , it 's difficult to do remotely . If we can figure out more ways of enabling people to work together in a distributed way , we can start enabling more people to participate meaningfully in a wider variety of jobs .

According to NTT’s State of CX 2023 report, 92% of CEOs believe improvements in CX directly impact their improved productivity, and customer brand advocacy. They also recognize that the quality of their employee experience (EX) is critical to success. The real potential for transforming business, according to 95% of CEOs, is bringing customer and employee experience improvements together into one end-to-end strategy. This, they anticipate, will deliver revenue growth, business agility, and resilience. To succeed, organizations need to reimagine what’s possible with customer and employee experience and understand horizon trends that will affect their business.

To improve windmills before AI, she says, the company analyzed data from observing a functioning prototype, a process that took weeks. Now, the manufacturer has dramatically shortened the process using a digital twin—a digital model of the operational windmill—using machine learning (ML) and AI to create and simulate improvements. “Sometimes it was impossible and physically challenging for them to even go and get all the measurements, so they used drones and AI technologies to generate a digital win,” Jyoti says. This manufacturer now sees this AI/ML technology as essential. ""Because if they’re not doing it, they’re not going to be relevant,” she says. Disruption in manufacturing and the supply chain has pushed businesses toward digital transformation as they seek ways to stay competitive. For manufacturers, these disruptions—along with the advent of AI—present opportunities to make manufacturing more efficient, safer, and sustainable.  Companies can use AI to streamline processes and fight downtime, adopt robotics that promote safety and speed, allow AI to detect anomalies quickly through computer vision, and develop AI systems to process vast volumes of data to identify patterns and predict customer needs. “In manufacturing, the biggest benefits come when people from the business are able to work together with data experts, using data and AI to get insights, ultimately taking actions to improve their processes,” says Pierre Goutorbe, AI solutions director for energy and manufacturing at Dataiku. “The more workers get familiar with AI and use it on a daily basis, the more we’ll see the benefit from it,” he says. Between supply-chain disruptions and worker shortages, the manufacturing sector has been innovating to stay ahead in the global marketplace. However, a June 2023 study by Dataiku and Databricks found manufacturing lags behind other industries, with about a quarter (24%) of companies still at the exploration or experimentation stage in terms of AI adoption, while only about one-fifth (19%) of companies across all other industries are still in this beginning stage.

AI-powered 6G networks will reshape digital interactions,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/26/1082028/ai-powered-6g-networks-will-reshape-digital-interactions/,2023-10-26,"Sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks, underpinned by artificial intelligence (AI), are poised to combine communication and computing in a hyperconnected world of digital and physical experiences that will transform daily lives, experts predict. “In the past, we talked about internet of things, but with 6G, we talk about intelligent or smart internet of things,” says Qin…","In partnership withVivo Sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks, underpinned by artificial intelligence (AI), are poised to combine communication and computing in a hyperconnected world of digital and physical experiences that will transform daily lives, experts predict. “In the past, we talked about internet of things, but with 6G, we talk about intelligent or smart internet of things,” says Qin Fei, president of communications research institute at Vivo, a Chinese mobile phone maker that has stepped up R&D efforts into 6G since 2020. Communication and tech companies are already planning for 6G wireless networks, even though 5G has yet to be fully rolled out globally. With improved data latency, security, reliability, and the ability to process massive volumes of global data in real time, experts like Qin believe 6G is set to transform our leisure and work. Among the new use cases for 6G networks envisioned by Vivo are mixed reality, holographic and multi-sensory communication, interactive 3D virtual digital humans, collaborative robots, and automated driving. There are expectations for 6G to be deployed by 2030. The UN’s telecoms agency, International Telecommunication Union (ITU), has stated it plans to finish the initial 6G standardization process no later than the year 2030. Optimized by AI technologies, experts expect 6G to have a bigger impact than 5G for two reasons. One, because it will enable the convergence of computing and mobile communications. Two, because it will integrate digital and physical realms and introduce new sensory experiences for users. Qin says that “6G will provide super communication and ubiquitous information, and converge computing services, thus being the base for an interconnected and converged physical and digital world.” Capgemini agrees—predicting that 6G networks will enable immersive, ubiquitous, and sensory digital experiences on a massive scale. This will make it possible for 6G applications to “sense” their surroundings, and thereby turn the network into “our sixth sense”, according to a report by the consultancy. As each generation of wireless networks becomes increasingly complex, they rely on other technologies to harness their power and make them easier to run. 6G is expected to be one of the first AI-native networks, where AI is embedded in the networking equipment. This will enable the network to learn and manage itself, be more autonomous, and make it cheaper to run. “When we are designing the 6G network, we're going to use AI technology in designing the air interface and also in managing the 6G network,” says Qin. Machine learning and AI-based network automation will be crucial to simplify network management and optimization. “The 6G network with AI inside is like a very good student,” he adds. “The 6G network will self-train, self-learn, and it will actually grow as a student to become more and more powerful.” Although 6G standards and specifications are still under development, experts agree that it will be a leapfrog technology, thanks to its higher speed (estimates vary, but 6G could be between 10 times, 50 times, to 100 times faster than 5G) and significantly reduced latency; improved connectivity, security, and reliability; and an ability to integrate digital and physical versions of the world. “For 5G, it’s mainly a communication technology—that’s its core,” says Qin. “But for 6G, besides enhanced communications technology, it also includes computing, as well as other relevant services.” Another benefit is wider geographical coverage than 5G— 6G will cover the whole planet and connect all kinds of machines, he adds. Qin says 6G networks will also popularize the use of digital twins—virtual replicas of products or processes used to predict how the physical entities will perform in the real world. This will be possible due to 6G networks’ enhanced connectivity, stronger sensing capability, and capacity to collect massive amounts of data. According to Qin: “We could have more powerful connectivity and sensing capability, so we could install more sensors in the physical world and collect a massive amount of data about this world. With this data we could build models to rebuild the world in the digital arena.” Vivo believes 6G will support dozens or hundreds of new services in a wide range of industries. The company is developing prototype 6G mobile technologies based on three trends—communication plus sensing; communication plus computing; and communication plus AI. For example, Vivo is developing a prototype that can collect users’ biometric data to monitor their health while they are asleep. According to this technological vision, a person’s bedside phone could become a medical monitoring device. “If there is any health issue or abnormal behavior happening with respiration, then [the phone] could send an alert to the hospital,” says Qin. Vivo also sees virtual and mixed reality glasses as another potential application for 6G that could revolutionize video streaming by making it a more compelling and immersive experience. Current AR glasses have limited computing power, says Qin. “Therefore, it needs to connect as a kind of edge device to the cloud so it could provide better experiences for the users.” 6G will also support self-driving or autonomous cars. “I believe autonomous driving will be very popular after 2030 and be supported by 6G,” says Qin. “Driverless cars need to really gather all kinds of data, for example, about the ambient environment, about road conditions and even the adjacent cars in order to make informed decisions [such as] whether it should speed up or break. 6G can provide the computing power and network.” Although 5G mobile networks have yet to live up to initial expectations, most experts agree that 6G has the potential to deliver major advances in connectivity and computing power. However, like any complex and powerful new technology, 6G also faces challenges, including network capacity and energy consumption. Getting to the 6G era requires an increase in network capacity. Finding the right telecommunications spectrum to support its rollout is crucial. It has not been finalized but 6.4 to 15 gigahertz is under consideration for 6G. “We think that the spectrum for 6G should be on the lower spectrum, like 6.4 to 7.1 gigahertz, because the lower band electromagnetic wave physically has much better coverage and penetration characteristics,” says Qin. Minimizing 6G’s energy consumption and carbon emissions is another major task. 6G networks will have vastly more computing demands than 5G. Suppliers and users will need to cooperate to minimize energy use. According to a report by GSMA, which represents global telecom operators, energy-saving techniques (such as AI-driven sleep states and lithium-ion batteries) may help to make 6G more energy efficient. Ultimately, 6G will only succeed if it delivers great experiences and services for consumers and businesses, says Qin. “We should avoid overdesign of 6G network, and we should really collaborate with different verticals.” Problems faced by 5G networks—for example, bottlenecks in other technologies needed to support new terminals for 5G, such as material sciences for augmented reality equipment—should be lessons for 6G development, he adds.

That means we need the whole ecosystem to collaborate, to jointly develop 6G infrastructure, mobile terminals, and applications.” This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

As global data continues to grow exponentially, organizations face many hurdles between piling up historical data, real-time data streams from IoT sensors, and building data-driven supply chains. Senior vice president of product engineering at Hitachi Vantara, Bharti Patel sees these challenges as an opportunity to create a better data strategy. “Before enterprises can become data-driven, they must first become data intelligent,"" says Patel. ""That means knowing more about the data you have, whether you need to keep it or not, or where it should reside to derive the most value out of it."" Patel stresses that the data journey begins with data planning that includes all stakeholders from CIOs and CTOs to business users. Patel describes universal data intelligence as enterprises having the ability to gain better insights from data streams and meet increasing demands for transparency by offering seamless access to data and insights no matter where it resides. Building this intelligence means building a data infrastructure that is scalable, secure, cost-effective, and socially responsible. The public cloud is often lauded as a way for enterprises to innovate with agility at scale while on premises infrastructures are viewed as less accessible and user friendly. But while data streams continue to grow, IT budgets are not and Patel notes that many organizations that use the cloud are facing cost challenges. Combating this, says Patel, means finding the best of both worlds of both on-prem and cloud environments in private data centers to keep costs low but insights flowing. Looking ahead, Patel foresees a future of total automation. Today, data resides in many places from the minds of experts to documentation to IT support tickets, making it impossible for one person to be able to analyze all that data and glean meaningful insights. “As we go into the future, we'll see more manual operations converted into automated operations,"" says Patel. ""First, we'll see humans in the loop, and eventually we'll see a trend towards fully autonomous data centers."" This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Hitachi Vantara. Laurel Ruma: From MIT Technology Review, I'm Laurel Ruma and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.Our topic today is building better data infrastructures. Doing just the basics with data can be difficult, but when it comes to scaling and adopting emerging technologies, it's crucial to organize data, tear down data silos, and focus on how data infrastructure, which is so often in the background, comes to the front of your data strategy.Two words for you: data intelligence.My guest is Bharti Patel. Bharti is a senior vice president of product engineering at Hitachi Vantara. This episode of Business Lab is sponsored by Hitachi Vantara. Welcome, Bharti. Bharti Patel: Hey, thank you Laurel. Nice to be with you again. Laurel: So let's start off with kind of giving some context to this discussion. As global data continues to grow exponentially, according to IDC, it's projected to double between 2022 and 2026. Enterprises face many hurdles to becoming data-driven. These hurdles include, but aren't of course limited to, piles of historical data, new real-time data streams, and supply chains becoming more data-driven. How should enterprises be evaluating their data strategies? And what are the markers of a strong data infrastructure? Bharti: Yeah, Laurel, I can't agree more with you here. Data is growing exponentially, and as per one of the studies that we conducted recently where we talked to about 1,200 CIOs and CTOs from about 12 countries, then we have more proof for it that data is almost going to double every two to three years. And I think what's more interesting here is that data is going to grow, but their budgets are not going to grow in the same proportion. So instead of worrying about it, I want to tackle this problem differently. I want to look at how we convert this challenge into an opportunity by deriving value out of this deal. So let's talk a little more about this in the context of what's happening in the industry today. I'm sure everyone by now has heard about generative AI and why generative AI or gen AI is a buzzword. AI has been there in the industry forever. However, what has changed recently is ChatGPT has exposed the power of AI to common people right from school going kids to grandparents by providing a very simple natural language interface. And just to talk a little bit more about ChatGPT, it is the fastest growing app in the industry. It touched 100 million users in just about two months. And what has changed because of this very fast adoption is that this has got businesses interested in it. Everyone wants to see how to unleash the power of generative AI. In fact, according to McKinsey, they're saying it's like it's going to add about $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion to the global economy. That means we are talking about big numbers here, but everyone's talking about ChatGPT, but what is the science behind it? The science behind it is the large language models. And if you think of these large language models, they are AI models with billions or even trillions of parameters, and they are the science behind ChatGPT. However, to get most of these large language models or LLMs, they need to be fine-tuned because that means you're just relying on the public data. Then what you're getting, it means you're not getting first, you're not getting the information that you want, correct all the time. And of course there is a risk of people feeding bad data associated with it. So how do you make the most of it? And here actually comes your private data sets. So your proprietary data sets are very, very important here. And if you use this private data to fine-tune your models, I have no doubt in mind that it will create differentiation for you in the long run to remain competitive. So I think even with this, we're just scratching the surface here when it comes to gen AI. And what more needs to be thought about for enterprise adoption is all the features that are needed like explainability, traceability, quality, trustworthiness, reliability. So if you again look at all these parameters, actually data is again the centerpiece of everything here. And you have to harness this private data, you have to curate it, and you have to create the data sets that will give you the maximum return on investment. Now, before enterprises can become data-driven, I think they must first become data intelligent. And that means knowing more about the data you have, whether you need to keep it or not, or where it should reside to derive the most value out of it. And as I talk to more and more CIOs and CTOs, it is very evident that there's a lot of data out there and we need to find a way to fix the problem. Because that data may or may not be useful, but you are storing it, you are keeping it, and you are spending money on it. So that is definitely a problem that needs to be solved. Then back to your question of, what is the right infrastructure, what are some of the parameters of it? So in my mind, it needs to be nimble, it needs to be scalable, trusted, secured, cost-effective, and finally socially responsible. Laurel: That certainly gives us a lot of perspective, Bharti. So customers are demanding more access to data and enterprises also need to get better insights from the streams of data that they're accumulating. So could you describe what universal data intelligence is, and then how it relates to data infrastructure? Bharti: Universal data intelligence is the ability for businesses to offer seamless access to data and insights irrespective of where it resides. So basically we are talking about getting full insights into your data in a hybrid environment. Also, on the same lines, we also talk about our approach to infrastructure, which is a distributed approach. And what I mean by distributed is that you do as little data movement as possible because moving data from one place to another place is expensive. So what we are doing here at Hitachi Vantara, we are designing systems. Think of it as there is an elastic fabric that ties it all together and we are able to get insights from the data no matter where it resides in a very, very timely manner. And even this data could be in any format, from structured, unstructured, and it could be blocked to file to objects. And just to kind of give you an example of the same, recently we worked with the Arizona Department of Water Resources to simplify their data management strategy. They have data coming from more than 300,000 water resources like means we are talking about huge data sets here. And what we did there for them was we designed an intelligent data discovery and automation tool. And in fact, we completed this data discovery and the metadata cataloging and platform migration in just two weeks with minimal downtime. And we are hearing all the time from them that they are really happy with it and they're now able to understand, integrate, and analyze the data sets to meet the needs of their water users, their planners, and their decision makers. Laurel: So that's a great example. So data and how it's stored and managed is clearly a competitive differentiator as well. But although the amount of data is increasing, many budgets, as you mentioned, particularly IT budgets are not. So how can organizations navigate building a data infrastructure that's effective and cost-efficient? And then do you have another example of how to do more with less? Bharti: Yeah, I think that's a great question. And this goes back to having data intelligence as the first step to becoming data-driven and reaping the full benefits of the data. So I think it goes back to you needing to know what exists and why it exists. And all of it should be available to the decision makers and the people who are working on the data at their fingertips. Just to give an example here, suppose you have data that you're just retaining because you need to just retain it for legal purposes, and the likelihood of it being used is extremely, extremely low. So there's no point in storing that data on an expensive storage device. It makes sense to transfer that data to a low cost object storage. And at the same time, you might have the data that you need to access all the time. And speed is important. Low latency is important, and that kind of data needs to reside on fast NVMEs. And in fact, many of our customers do it all the time, and in fact in all the sectors. So what they do is they have their data, which through the policies, they constantly transfer from our highly, highly efficient file systems to object storage based on the policies. And it's like they still retain the pointers there in the file system and they're able to access it back in case they need it. Laurel: So the public cloud is often cited as a way for enterprises to scale, be more agile, and innovate while by contrast, legacy on-premises infrastructures are seen as less user-friendly and accessible. How accurate is this conception and how should enterprises approach data modernization and management of that data? Bharti: Yeah, I've got to admit here that the public cloud and the hyperscalers have raised the bar in terms of what is possible when it comes to innovation. However, we are also seeing and hearing from our customers that the cost is a concern there. And in fact, many of our customers, they move to cloud very fast and now they're facing the cost challenge. When their CIOs see the bills going exponentially up, they're asking like, ""Hey, well how could we keep it flat?"" That's where I think we see a big opportunity, how to provide the same experience that cloud provides in a private data center so that when customers are talking about partition of the data, we have something equivalent to offer. And here again, I have got to say that we want to address in a slightly different manner. I think we want to address it so that customers are able to take full advantage of the elasticity of the cloud, and also they're able to take full advantage of on-prem environments. And how we want to do it, we want to do it in such a way that it's almost in a seamless way, in a seamless manner. They can manage the data from their private data centers, doing the cloud and get the best from both worlds. Laurel: An interesting perspective there, but this also kind of requires different elements of the business to come in. So from a leadership perspective, what are some best practices that you've instituted or recommended to make that transition to better data management? Bharti: Yeah, I would say I think the data journey starts with data planning, and which should not be done in a siloed manner. And getting it right from the onset is extremely, extremely important. And what you need to do here is at the beginning of your data planning, you've got to get all the stakeholders together, whether it's your CIO, your business users, your CTOs. So this strategy should never be done in a siloed manner. And in fact, I do want to think about, highlight another aspect, which probably people don't do very much is how do you even bring your partners into the mix? In fact, I do have an example here. Prior to joining Hitachi Vantara, I was a CTO, an air purifier company. And as we were defining our data strategy, we were looking at our Salesforce data, we were looking at data in our NetSuite, we were looking at the customer tickets, and we were doing all this to see how we can drive marketing campaigns. And as I was looking at this data, I felt that something was totally missing. And in fact, what was missing was the weather data, which is not our data, which was third-party data. For us to design effective marketing campaigns, it was very important for us to have insights into this weather data. For example, if there are allergies in a particular region or if there are wildfires in a particular region. And that data was so important. So having a strategy where you are able to bring all stakeholders, all parts of data together and think from the beginning is the right thing to get started. Laurel: And with big hairy problems and goals, there's also this consideration that data centers contribute to an enterprise's carbon emissions. Thinking about partnerships and modernizing data management and everything we've talked about so far, how can enterprises meet sustainability goals while also modernizing their data infrastructure to accommodate all of their historical and real-time data, especially when it comes from, as you mentioned, so many different sources? Bharti: Yeah, I'm glad that you are bringing up this point because it's very important not to ignore this. And in fact, with all the gen AI and all the things that we are talking about, like one fine-tuning of one model can actually generate up to five times the carbon emissions that are possible from a passenger car in a lifetime. So we're talking about a huge, huge environmental effect here. And this particular topic is extremely important to Hitachi. And in fact, our goal is to go carbon-neutral with our operations by 2030 and across our value chain by 2050. And how we are addressing this problem here is kind of both on the hardware side and also on the software side. Right from the onset, we are designing our hardware, we are looking at end-to-end components to see what kind of carbon footprint it creates and how we could really minimize it. And in fact, once our hardware is ready, actually, it needs to pass through a very stringent set of energy certifications. And so that's on the hardware side. Now, on the software side, actually, I have just started this initiative where we are looking at how we can move to modern languages that are more likely to create less carbon footprint. And this is where we are looking at how we can replace our existing Java [code base] with Rust, wherever it makes sense. And again, this is a big problem we all need to think about and it cannot be solved overnight, but we have to constantly think about interface manner. Laurel: Well, certainly are impressive goals. How can emerging technologies like generative AI, as you were saying before, help push an organization into a next generation of data infrastructure systems, but then also help differentiate it from competitors? Bharti: Yeah, I want to take a kind of a two-pronged approach here. First, what I call is table stakes. So if you don't do it, you'll be completely wiped out. And these are simple things about how you automate certain things, how you create better customer experience. But in my mind, that's not enough. You got to think about what kind of disruptions you will create for yourself and for your customers. So a couple of ideas that we are working on here are the companions or copilots. And these are, think of them as AI agents in the data centers. And these agents actually help the data center environment from becoming more reactive to proactive. So basically these agents are running in your data center all the time and they're watching if there is a new patch available and if you should update to the new patch, or maybe there's a new white paper that has better insights to manage some of your resources. So this is like these agents are constantly acting in your data center. They are aware of what's going on on the internet based on how you have designed, and they're able to provide you with creative solutions. And I think that's going to be the disruption here, and that's something we are working on. Laurel: So looking to the future, what tools, technologies, or trends do you see emerging as more and more enterprises look to modernize their data infrastructure and really benefit from data intelligence? Bharti: Again, I'll go back to what I'm talking about, generative AI here, and I'll give an example. For one of our customers, we are managing their data center, and I'm also part of that channel where we see constant back and forth between the support and the engineering. The support is asking, ""Hey, this is what is happening, what should we be doing?"" So just think of it like a different scenario that you have all this and you were able to collect this data and feed it into the LLMs. When you're talking about this data, this data resides at several places. It resides in the heads of our experts. It is there in the documentation, it's there in the support tickets, it's there in logs, like life logs. It is there in the traces. So it's almost impossible for a human being to analyze this data and get meaningful insights. However, if we combine LLMs with the power of, say, knowledge graphs, vector databases, and other tools, it will be possible to analyze this data at the speed of light, and present the recommendation in front of the user through a very simple user interface. And in most cases, just via a very simple natural language interface. So I think that's a kind of a complete paradigm shift where you have so many sources that you need to constantly analyze versus having the full automation. And that's why I feel that these copilots will become an essential part of the data centers. In the beginning they'll help with the automation to deal with the problems prevalent in any data center like resource management and optimization, proactive problem determination, and resolution of the same. As we go into the future, we'll see more manual operations converted into automated operations. First, we'll see humans in the loop, and eventually we'll see a trend towards fully autonomous data centers. Laurel: Well, that is quite a future.

For example , if there are allergies in a particular region or if there are wildfires in a particular region . And that data was so important . So having a strategy where you are able to bring all stakeholders , all parts of data together and think from the beginning is the right thing to get started . Laurel : And with big hairy problems and goals , there 's also this consideration that data centers contribute to an enterprise 's carbon emissions . Thinking about partnerships and modernizing data management and everything we 've talked about so far , how can enterprises meet sustainability goals while also modernizing their data infrastructure to accommodate all of their historical and real-time data , especially when it comes from , as you mentioned , so many different sources ? Bharti : Yeah , I 'm glad that you are bringing up this point because it 's very important not to ignore this . And in fact , with all the gen AI and all the things that we are talking about , like one fine-tuning of one model can actually generate up to five times the carbon emissions that are possible from a passenger car in a lifetime . So we 're talking about a huge , huge environmental effect here . And this particular topic is extremely important to Hitachi . And in fact , our goal is to go carbon-neutral with our operations by 2030 and across our value chain by 2050 . And how we are addressing this problem here is kind of both on the hardware side and also on the software side . Right from the onset , we are designing our hardware , we are looking at end-to-end components to see what kind of carbon footprint it creates and how we could really minimize it . And in fact , once our hardware is ready , actually , it needs to pass through a very stringent set of energy certifications . And so that 's on the hardware side . Now , on the software side , actually , I have just started this initiative where we are looking at how we can move to modern languages that are more likely to create less carbon footprint . And this is where we are looking at how we can replace our existing Java [ code base ] with Rust , wherever it makes sense . And again , this is a big problem we all need to think about and it can not be solved overnight , but we have to constantly think about interface manner . Laurel : Well , certainly are impressive goals . How can emerging technologies like generative AI , as you were saying before , help push an organization into a next generation of data infrastructure systems , but then also help differentiate it from competitors ? Bharti : Yeah , I want to take a kind of a two-pronged approach here . First , what I call is table stakes . So if you do n't do it , you 'll be completely wiped out . And these are simple things about how you automate certain things , how you create better customer experience . But in my mind , that 's not enough . You got to think about what kind of disruptions you will create for yourself and for your customers . So a couple of ideas that we are working on here are the companions or copilots . And these are , think of them as AI agents in the data centers . And these agents actually help the data center environment from becoming more reactive to proactive . So basically these agents are running in your data center all the time and they 're watching if there is a new patch available and if you should update to the new patch , or maybe there 's a new white paper that has better insights to manage some of your resources . So this is like these agents are constantly acting in your data center . They are aware of what 's going on on the internet based on how you have designed , and they 're able to provide you with creative solutions . And I think that 's going to be the disruption here , and that 's something we are working on . Laurel : So looking to the future , what tools , technologies , or trends do you see emerging as more and more enterprises look to modernize their data infrastructure and really benefit from data intelligence ? Bharti : Again , I 'll go back to what I 'm talking about , generative AI here , and I 'll give an example . For one of our customers , we are managing their data center , and I 'm also part of that channel where we see constant back and forth between the support and the engineering . The support is asking , `` Hey , this is what is happening , what should we be doing ? '' So just think of it like a different scenario that you have all this and you were able to collect this data and feed it into the LLMs . When you 're talking about this data , this data resides at several places . It resides in the heads of our experts . It is there in the documentation , it 's there in the support tickets , it 's there in logs , like life logs . It is there in the traces . So it 's almost impossible for a human being to analyze this data and get meaningful insights . However , if we combine LLMs with the power of , say , knowledge graphs , vector databases , and other tools , it will be possible to analyze this data at the speed of light , and present the recommendation in front of the user through a very simple user interface . And in most cases , just via a very simple natural language interface . So I think that 's a kind of a complete paradigm shift where you have so many sources that you need to constantly analyze versus having the full automation . And that 's why I feel that these copilots will become an essential part of the data centers . In the beginning they 'll help with the automation to deal with the problems prevalent in any data center like resource management and optimization , proactive problem determination , and resolution of the same . As we go into the future , we 'll see more manual operations converted into automated operations . First , we 'll see humans in the loop , and eventually we 'll see a trend towards fully autonomous data centers . Laurel : Well , that is quite a future .

Optimizing platforms offers customers and stakeholders a better way to bank,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/09/27/1079913/optimizing-platforms-offers-customers-and-stakeholders-a-better-way-to-bank/,2023-09-27,"When it comes to banking, whether it’s personal, business, or private, customer experience is everything.

Building new technologies and platforms, employing them at scale, and optimizing workflows is especially critical for any large bank looking to meet evolving customer and internal stakeholder demands for faster and more personalized ways of doing business. Institutions like JPMorgan Chase are implementing best practices, cost efficient cloud migration, and emerging AI and machine learning (ML) tools to build better ways to bank, says Head of Managed Accounts, Client Onboarding and Client Services Technology at J. P. Morgan Private Bank, Vrinda Menon. Menon stresses that it is critical that technologists stay very focused on the business impact of the software and tools they develop. “We coach our teams that success and innovation does not come from rebuilding something that somebody has already built, but instead from leveraging it and taking the next leap with additional features upon it to create high impact business outcomes,” says Menon. At JPMorgan Chase, technologists are encouraged, where possible, to see the bigger picture and solve for the larger pattern rather than just the singular problem at hand. To reduce redundancies and automate tasks, Menon and her team focus on data and measurements that indicate where emerging technologies like AI and machine learning could enhance processes like onboarding or transaction processing at scale.  AI/ML have become commonplace across many industries with private banking being no exception, says Menon. At a base level, AI/ML can extract data from documents, classify information, analyze data smartly and detect issues and outliers across a wide range of use cases. But Menon is looking to the near future when AI/ML can help proactively predict client needs based on various signals. For example, a private banking client that has recently been married may ask their bank for a title change. Using the client’s data in context and this new request, AI/ML tools could proactively help bankers identify additional things to ask this client, such as need to change beneficiaries or the possibility to optimize taxes by considering jointly filed taxes. “You have an opportunity to be more proactive and think about it holistically so you can address their needs before they even come to you to ask for that level of engagement and detail,” says Menon. This episode of Business Lab is produced in association with JPMorgan Chase.  Laurel Ruma: From MIT Technology Review. I'm Laurel Ruma and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.Our topic today is investing in building great experiences. A number of people benefit from enterprise investment in emerging and new technologies, including customers who want better, faster, and newer ways of doing business. But internal stakeholders want the same investment in better tools and systems to build those fast and new ways of doing business. Balancing both needs is possible.Two words for you: optimizing platforms.Today we're talking with Vrinda Menon, the chief technology officer of Managed Accounts, Client Onboarding and Client Services at JPMorgan Private Bank.This podcast is produced in association with JPMorgan Chase.Welcome, Vrinda.Vrinda Menon: Thank you so much, Laurel. I'm looking forward to this discussion.Laurel: Great. So, let's start with how often people think of JPMorgan Chase. They likely associate the company with personal banking, ATMs and credit cards, but could you describe what services the private bank provides and how operations and client services have evolved and transformed since you began your role at JPMorgan Chase? Vrinda: Sure. JPMorgan Chase indeed does far more than personal banking, credit cards and ATMs. The private bank of JPMorgan Chase is often referred to as the crown jewel of our franchise. We service our high net worth clients and ultra-high net worth clients across the globe. We provide them services like investment management, trust and estate planning, banking services, brokerage services, customized lending, etc., just to name a few. And in terms of what has transformed in the recent years since I joined, I would say that we've become far more tech savvy as an organization, and this is thanks and no small measure to new leadership as well in operations and client services. I think three things have changed very dramatically since I've joined. The first is culture. In my first few months, I spent a week doing the job of an operations analyst. And in doing that I started to understand firsthand the painful manual work that people were subject to and feeling like they did not have the permission to have things changed for them. But working off that and actually connecting with a lot more people at the ground who are doing these types of activities, we worked with them to make those changes and make them see light at the end of the tunnel. And then suddenly the demand for more change and demand for more automation started building as a groundswell energy with support from our partners in operations and services. Now, routine, repetitive, mundane, mind-numbing work is not an option at the table. It's become a thing of the past. And secondly, what we've done also is we've grown an army of citizen developers who really have access to tools and technologies where they can do quick automation without having to depend on broader programs and broader pieces of technology. We've also done something super interesting, which is, over the past three years we've taken every new analyst in the private bank and trained them on Python. And so, they've started to see the benefits of doing things themselves. So, culture change I think has been one of the biggest things that we've achieved in the past few years since I joined. Second, we built a whole set of capabilities, we call them common capabilities. Things like how do you configure new workflows? How do you make decisions using spreadsheets and decision models versus coding it into systems? So,  you can configure it, you can modify it, and you can do things more effectively. And then tools like checklists, which can be again put into systems and automated in a few minutes, in many cases. Today, we have millions of tasks and millions of decisions being executed through these capabilities, which has suddenly game-changed our ability to provide automation at scale. And last but not least, AI and machine learning, it now plays an important role in the underpinnings of everything that we do in operations and client services. For example, we do a lot of process analytics. We do load balancing. So, when a client calls, which agent or which group of people do we direct that client call to so that they can actually service the client most effectively. In the space of payments, we do a lot with machine learning. Fraud detection is another, and I will say that I'm so glad we've had the time to invest and think through all of these foundational capabilities. So, we are now poised and ready to take on the next big leap of changes that are right now at our fingertips, especially in the evolving world of AI and machine learning and of course the public cloud.Laurel: Excellent. Yeah, you've certainly outlined the diversity of the firm's offerings. So, when building new technologies and platforms, what are some of the working methodologies and practices that you employ to build at scale and then optimize those workflows? Vrinda: Yeah, as I said before, the private bank has a lot of offerings, but then amplify that with all the other offerings that JPMorgan Chase, the franchise has, a commercial bank, a corporate and investment bank, a consumer and community bank, and many of our clients cross all of these lines of business. It brings a lot of benefits, but it also has complexities. And one of the things that I obsess personally over is how do we simplify things, not add to the complexity? Second is a mantra of reuse. Don't reinvent because it's easy for technologists to look at a piece of software and say, ""That's great, but I can build something better."" Instead, the three things that I ask people to focus on and our organization collectively with our partners focus on is first of all, look at the business outcome. We coach our teams that success and innovation does not come from rebuilding something that somebody has already built, but instead from leveraging it and taking the next leap with additional features upon it to create high impact business outcomes. So, focusing on outcome number one. Second, if you are given a problem, try and look at it from a bigger picture to see whether you can solve the pattern instead of that specific problem. So, I'll give you an example. We built a chatbot called Casey. It's one of the most loved products in our private bank right now. And Casey doesn't do anything really complex, but what it does is solves a very common pattern, which is ask a few simple questions, get the inputs, join this with data services and join this with execution services and complete the task. And we have hundreds of thousands of tasks that Casey performs every single day. And one of them, especially a very simple functionality, the client wants a bank reference letter. Casey is called upon to do that thousands of times a month. And what used to take three or four hours to produce now takes like a few seconds. So, it suddenly changes the outcome, changes productivity, and changes the happiness of people who are doing things that you know they themselves felt was mundane. So, solving the pattern, again, important. And last but not least, focusing on data is the other thing that's helped us. Nothing can be improved if you don't measure it. So, to give you an example of processes, the first thing we did was pick the most complex processes and mapped them out. We understood each step in the process, we understood the purpose of each step in the process, the time taken in each step, we started to question, do you really need this approval from this person? We observed that for the past six months, not one single thing has been rejected. So, is that even a meaningful approval to begin with? Questioning if that process could be enhanced with AI, could AI automatically say, ""Yes, please approve,"" or ""There's a risk in this do not approve,"" or ""It's okay, it needs a human review."" And then making those changes in our systems and flows and then obsessively measuring the impact of those changes. All of these have given us a lot of benefits. And I would say we've made significant progress just with these three principles of focus on outcome, focus on solving the pattern and focus on data and measurements in areas like client onboarding, in areas like maintaining client data, et cetera. So, this has been very helpful for us because in a bank like ours, scale is super important.Laurel: Yeah, that's a really great explanation. So, when new challenges do come along, like moving to the public cloud, how do you balance the opportunities of that scale, but also computing power and resources within the cost of the actual investment? How do you ensure that the shifts to the cloud are actually both financially and operationally efficient? Vrinda: Great question. So obviously every technologist in the world is super excited with the advent of the public cloud. It gives us the powers of agility, economies of scale. We at JPMorgan Chase are able to leverage world class evolving capabilities at our fingertips. We have the ability also to partner with talented technologies at the cloud providers and many service providers that we work with that have advanced solutions that are available first on the public cloud. We are eager to get our hands on those. But with that comes a lot of responsibility because as a bank, we have to worry about security, client data, privacy, resilience, how are we going to operate in a multi-cloud environment because some data has to remain on-prem in our private cloud. So, there's a lot of complexity, and we have engineers across the board who think a lot about this, and their day and night jobs are to try and figure this out. As we think about moving to the public cloud in my area, I personally spend time thinking in depth about how we could build architectures that are financially efficient. And the reason I bring that up is because traditionally as we think about data centers where our hardware and software has been hosted, developers and architects haven't had to worry about costs because you start with sizing the infrastructure, you order that infrastructure, it's captive, it remains in the data center, and you can expand it, but it's a one-time cost each time that you upgrade. With the cloud, that situation changes dramatically. It's both an opportunity but also a risk. So, a financial lens then becomes super important right at the outset. Let me give you a couple of examples of what I mean. Developers in the public cloud have a lot of power, and with that power comes responsibility. So, I'm a developer and my application is not working right now because there's some issue. I have the ability to actually spin up additional processes. I have the ability to spin up additional environments, all of which attract costs, and if I don't control and manage that, the cost could quickly pile up. Data storage, again, we had fixed storage, we could expand it periodically in the data centers, but in the public cloud, you have choices. You can say data that's going to be slowly accessed versus data that's going to be accessed frequently to be stored in different types of storage with different costs as a result. Now think about something like a financial ledger where you have retention requirements of let's say 20 years. The cost could quickly pile up if you store it in the wrong type of storage. So, there's an opportunity to optimize cost there, and if you ignore it and you've not kept an eye on it, you could actually have costs that are just not required. To do this right, we have to ask developers, architects, and our engineers to not just think about the best performance, the most optimal resilience, but also think about cost as a fundamental aspect of how we look at architectures. So, this for me is a huge area of focus, starting with awareness for our people, training our people, thinking about architecture patterns, solution patterns, tooling, measurements, so that we completely stay on top of this and become more effective and more efficient in how we get to the public cloud. While the journey is exciting, I want to make sure that as we land there, we land safely and optimally from a cost standpoint. Laurel: And especially in your position, thinking about how technology will affect the firm years and the future is critical. Therefore, as emerging technologies like AI and machine learning become more commonplace across industries, could you offer an example of how you're using them in the areas that you cover?Vrinda: Yeah, certainly. And we use AI/ML at many levels of complexity. So let me start with the base case. AI/ML, especially in operations and client services, starts with can I get data from documents? Can I OCR those documents, which is optical character recognition? Can I get information out of it, can I classify it? Can I perform analytics on it? So that's the base case. On top of that, as you look at data, for example, payments data or data of transactions, and let's say human beings are scanning them for issues or outliers, outlier detection techniques with AI/ML, they are also table stakes now, and many of our systems do that. But as you move on to the next level of prediction, what we've been able to do is start to build up models where say the client is calling. The client has all these types of cases in progress right now. What could they be calling about in addition to this? The client expressed sentiment about something that they were not happy with two weeks ago. Is it likely that they're calling about this? Can I have that information at the fingertips of the client service agent so they can look at it and respond as soon as the client asks for something? And think about the next stage of evolution, which is, the client came to us and said, ""Change my title because I just got married."" Typically, in a transactional kind of activity, you would respond to the client and fix the title from let's say, Ms. to Mrs. if that's what they asked you to do. But imagine if when they came to do that, we said to them, here's 10 other things that you should possibly think of now that you said you've got married. Congratulations. Do you want to address your beneficiaries? Do you want to change something in tax planning? Do you want to change the type of tax calculations that you do because you want to optimize now that you're married, and you and your spouse could be filing jointly? Again, not that the client would choose to change those things, but you have an opportunity to be more proactive and think about it holistically so you can address their needs before they even come to you asking for that level of engagement and detail. We also exploit a lot of AI/ML capabilities and in client onboarding to get better data to start to predict what data is right and start to predict risk. And our next leap, I believe strongly, and I'm super excited about this area of large language models, which I think are going to offer us exponential possibilities, not just in JPMorgan Chase, but as you can see in the world right now with technologies like ChatGPT, OpenAI's technologies, as well as any of the other publicly available large language models that are being developed every single day. Laurel: Well, it's clear that AI offers great opportunities for optimizing platforms and transformations. Could you describe the process of how JPMorgan Chase decided to create dedicated teams for AI and machine learning, and how did you build out those teams? Vrinda: Yeah, certainly. At JPMorgan Chase, we've been cultivating the mindset for some years now to think AI-first while hiring people. And we also leverage the best talent in the industry, and we've hired a lot of people in our research divisions as well to work on AI/ML. We've got thousands, several thousand technologists focused on AI. For me personally, in 2020, during the first months of the pandemic, I decided that I needed to see more AI/ML activity across my areas. So, I did what I called the “Summer of AI/ML,” and this was a fully immersive program that ran over 12 weeks with training for our people, and it was not full-time. So, they would dial in for a couple of hours, get trained on an AI/ML concept and some techniques, and then they would continue that and practice that for the week. Then we had ideation sessions with our users for a couple of weeks and then a hackathon and some brilliant ideas came out of it. But when I stepped back and looked at this whole thing and the results of it, a few months later, I realized that many of the ideas had not reached the final destination into production. And in thinking a little more deeply about that, I understood that we had a problem. The problem was as follows, while AI is a great thing and everybody appreciates it, until AI becomes ingrained in everybody's brain as the first thing to think about, there's always going to be a healthy tension between choosing the next best feature on a product, which is very deterministic. If you say, add this button here or add these features using conventional technologies like Java versus game-changing the product using AI, which is a little bit more of a risk, the results are not always predictable, and it requires experimentation and R&D. And so, when you have a choice of incremental changes that are deterministic and changes that are more probabilistic, people tend to take the most certain answer. And so, I decided that I needed to build out a focused, dedicated team of data scientists who were just going to obsess about solving problems in the space of data science and embed them across the products that we were building. And now the results are starting to show for themselves because the work they've done is phenomenal and the demand on them is growing every single day to the point where I've grown the team and the value that they're providing is also measured and visible to the broader organization.Laurel: So, in JPMorgan Chase's client services, customer experience is clearly a driving force. How do you ensure that your teams are providing clients, especially those high-net-worth private clients that have high expectations of service with services that then meet their banking and account management needs? Vrinda: So, we obsess over customer experience starting from the CEO down to every single employee. I have three tenets for my team. Number one is client experience, the second is user experience, and third is engineering excellence. And they know that a lot of us are measured by how well we service our clients. So, in the private bank specifically, in addition to reviewing our core capabilities like our case management system, our voice recognition systems, our fraud capture systems, all of that, we continuously analyze data received from client surveys, data received through every single interaction that we have with our client across all channels. So, whether it be a voice channel, whether it be emails, whether it be things that the client types in our websites, the places that they access, and our models just do not look at sentiment, they also look at client experience. And as they look at experience, the things that we are trying to understand are, first of all, how's the client feeling in this interaction? But more important is client one and client two and client three feeling the same thing about a particular aspect of our process, and do we need to change that process as a result, or is there more training that needs to be provided to our agents because we are not able to fully satisfy this category of requests? And by doing that continuously and analyzing it, and back to the point that I made earlier, by measuring it constantly, we are able to say, first of all, how was the experience to begin with? How is the experience now and after making these changes on these training programs or these fixes in our systems, how is that experience showing? And some of the other things we are able to do are look at experiences over a period of time. So, for example, the client came to us last year and their experience based on the measurements that we did was at a certain level, they continue to interact with us over a period of months. Has it gone up? Has it gone down? How is that needle trending? How do we take that to superb? And we've been able to figure out these in ways that we've been able to prevent complaints, for example, and get to a point where things are escalated to the right people in the organization, especially in the servicing space where we are able to triage and manage these things more effectively because we are a high- touch client business, and we need to make sure that our clients are extremely happy with us. Laurel: Oh yeah, absolutely. And sort of like another phase or idea when we're thinking about customer experience and customer services, building a workforce that can respond to it. So here we're going to talk a bit about how we promote diversity, which has been a tenet of your career, and you currently sit on the board of the Transition Network, which is a nonprofit that empowers a diverse network of women throughout career transitions. So, at JPMorgan Chase, how do you grow talent and improve representation across the company? And then how does that help build better customer experience? Vrinda: Sure, that's a great question. I certainly am very passionate about diversity, and during the past 15 years of my career, I've spent a lot of time supporting diversity. In my prior firm, I was co-head of the Asian Professional Network. Then subsequently for the past three years, I've been a board member at the Transition Network, which is all about women in transition. Meaning as they grow out of their careers into retirement and into other stages of life, how do we help them transition? And then here at JPMorgan Chase, I'm the sponsor for what is called the Take It Forward initiative, which is an initiative that supports 15,000 women technologists. JPMorgan Chase, as you know, does a broad range of activities in the area of diversity across all kinds of business resource groups, and we invest a lot of time and energy. But specifically, for the Take It Forward initiative that I sponsor, it plays a key role in helping these 15,000 women technologists continuously enhance their leadership skills, grow their technical skills, build their confidence, develop networks, learn from senior sponsors and mentors, grow their careers, all of which makes their work experience very enriching. When I hear things like I'm motivated, I get new energy interacting with these senior women, I trust my personal power more. I'm confident to negotiate with my manager for a better role; I feel confident that I can discuss my compensation. It makes me really happy, and especially when they say I stay in JPMorgan Chase because of Take It Forward, it brings tears to my eyes. It's really one of the most amazing volunteer driven initiatives in this organization. And a lot of people pour in passion, energy, time to make it succeed. And this initiative has won many awards as well externally. I strongly believe all of these efforts are critical as it changes when people's experiences change and when they're happy, what they do becomes that much more effective. And it changes how we work internally, how we present ourselves externally and game changes our business outcomes. I've seen that in problem solving meetings. When you evaluate risk and you bring in people from diverse backgrounds, some are more risk averse, some are more risk taking, and you suddenly see that dynamic play out and the outcome becomes much different from what it would've been if you didn't have all those people in the mix. So overall, I strongly believe in this, and I've seen it play out in every single firm that I've ever worked at. So that's my take on diversity and how it helps us. Laurel: Well, it certainly is important work, especially as it ties so tightly with the firm's own ethos. So Vrinda, looking forward, how do you envision the future of private banking and client management? As we see emerging technologies become more prevalent and enterprises start to shift their infrastructure to the public cloud? Vrinda: As I mentioned earlier, I see the next set of emerging technologies taking the world on a super exciting ride, and I think it's going to be as transformational as the advent of the world wide web. Just take the example of large language models. The areas that are most likely to be first disrupted will be any work that involves content creation because that is table stakes for a large language model. As I expand that to my work, the rest of my work, client services and operations and many other areas that require repetitive work and large-scale interpretation and synthesis of information, that's again, table stakes for large language models. Expand that now to the next evolution, which is agents that are now the emerging technology with large language models. When agents are provided with a suite of tools and they can use reasoning like humans to decide which tool to execute based on input, that'll game change the whole thing I was talking about earlier on workflow and task execution and operationally intense activities in the organization. When I look at myself as a software developer in the areas of code generation, code testing, code correction, test data generation, just to name a few, all of those are going to be game changed. So not just the work that our users do in the private bank, but the work that we do as technologists in the private bank. A lot of that is going to game change dramatically. And then you add on the next level, which is problem solving. Large language models are continuously being trained on all subjects ever known to humans. And that for me is the most fascinating part of this. It's like hundreds of thousands of brains that are working together on a diverse set of subjects. So, imagine a model that's been trained on a domain like medicine or aerospace or defense, and then trying to bring all of that brainpower together to solve a problem in finance. That truly to me is the ultimate gold standard of problem solving. We talked about diverse people in the room coming with different experiences but imagine models that have been trained. You suddenly have breadth, depth, range of diverse knowledge that could never have been contemplated at that scale. And in order to do all of this, obviously one of the key underpinnings is the public cloud and being able to spin up compute as quickly as possible to do complex calculations and then spin it down when you don't need it, which is where the public cloud becomes super important. So, all I can say in conclusion is I think this is an amazing time to be in technology, and I just cannot wait to see how we further step up our game in the coming months and years, and things are moving almost at the speed of light now. Every single day, new papers get published and new ideas are coming out building on top of some of the exponential technologies that we are seeing in the world today. Laurel: Oh, that's fantastic.

When it comes to banking , whether it ’ s personal , business , or private , customer experience is everything . Building new technologies and platforms , employing them at scale , and optimizing workflows is especially critical for any large bank looking to meet evolving customer and internal stakeholder demands for faster and more personalized ways of doing business . Institutions like JPMorgan Chase are implementing best practices , cost efficient cloud migration , and emerging AI and machine learning ( ML ) tools to build better ways to bank , says Head of Managed Accounts , Client Onboarding and Client Services Technology at J. P. Morgan Private Bank , Vrinda Menon . Menon stresses that it is critical that technologists stay very focused on the business impact of the software and tools they develop . “ We coach our teams that success and innovation does not come from rebuilding something that somebody has already built , but instead from leveraging it and taking the next leap with additional features upon it to create high impact business outcomes , ” says Menon . At JPMorgan Chase , technologists are encouraged , where possible , to see the bigger picture and solve for the larger pattern rather than just the singular problem at hand . To reduce redundancies and automate tasks , Menon and her team focus on data and measurements that indicate where emerging technologies like AI and machine learning could enhance processes like onboarding or transaction processing at scale . AI/ML have become commonplace across many industries with private banking being no exception , says Menon . At a base level , AI/ML can extract data from documents , classify information , analyze data smartly and detect issues and outliers across a wide range of use cases . But Menon is looking to the near future when AI/ML can help proactively predict client needs based on various signals . For example , a private banking client that has recently been married may ask their bank for a title change . Using the client ’ s data in context and this new request , AI/ML tools could proactively help bankers identify additional things to ask this client , such as need to change beneficiaries or the possibility to optimize taxes by considering jointly filed taxes . “ You have an opportunity to be more proactive and think about it holistically so you can address their needs before they even come to you to ask for that level of engagement and detail , ” says Menon . This episode of Business Lab is produced in association with JPMorgan Chase . Laurel Ruma : From MIT Technology Review . I 'm Laurel Ruma and this is Business Lab , the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.Our topic today is investing in building great experiences . A number of people benefit from enterprise investment in emerging and new technologies , including customers who want better , faster , and newer ways of doing business . But internal stakeholders want the same investment in better tools and systems to build those fast and new ways of doing business . Balancing both needs is possible.Two words for you : optimizing platforms.Today we 're talking with Vrinda Menon , the chief technology officer of Managed Accounts , Client Onboarding and Client Services at JPMorgan Private Bank.This podcast is produced in association with JPMorgan Chase.Welcome , Vrinda.Vrinda Menon : Thank you so much , Laurel . I 'm looking forward to this discussion.Laurel : Great . So , let 's start with how often people think of JPMorgan Chase . They likely associate the company with personal banking , ATMs and credit cards , but could you describe what services the private bank provides and how operations and client services have evolved and transformed since you began your role at JPMorgan Chase ? Vrinda : Sure . JPMorgan Chase indeed does far more than personal banking , credit cards and ATMs . The private bank of JPMorgan Chase is often referred to as the crown jewel of our franchise . We service our high net worth clients and ultra-high net worth clients across the globe . We provide them services like investment management , trust and estate planning , banking services , brokerage services , customized lending , etc. , just to name a few . And in terms of what has transformed in the recent years since I joined , I would say that we 've become far more tech savvy as an organization , and this is thanks and no small measure to new leadership as well in operations and client services . I think three things have changed very dramatically since I 've joined . The first is culture . In my first few months , I spent a week doing the job of an operations analyst . And in doing that I started to understand firsthand the painful manual work that people were subject to and feeling like they did not have the permission to have things changed for them . But working off that and actually connecting with a lot more people at the ground who are doing these types of activities , we worked with them to make those changes and make them see light at the end of the tunnel . And then suddenly the demand for more change and demand for more automation started building as a groundswell energy with support from our partners in operations and services . Now , routine , repetitive , mundane , mind-numbing work is not an option at the table . It 's become a thing of the past . And secondly , what we 've done also is we 've grown an army of citizen developers who really have access to tools and technologies where they can do quick automation without having to depend on broader programs and broader pieces of technology . We 've also done something super interesting , which is , over the past three years we 've taken every new analyst in the private bank and trained them on Python . And so , they 've started to see the benefits of doing things themselves . So , culture change I think has been one of the biggest things that we 've achieved in the past few years since I joined . Second , we built a whole set of capabilities , we call them common capabilities . Things like how do you configure new workflows ? How do you make decisions using spreadsheets and decision models versus coding it into systems ? So , you can configure it , you can modify it , and you can do things more effectively . And then tools like checklists , which can be again put into systems and automated in a few minutes , in many cases . Today , we have millions of tasks and millions of decisions being executed through these capabilities , which has suddenly game-changed our ability to provide automation at scale . And last but not least , AI and machine learning , it now plays an important role in the underpinnings of everything that we do in operations and client services . For example , we do a lot of process analytics . We do load balancing . So , when a client calls , which agent or which group of people do we direct that client call to so that they can actually service the client most effectively . In the space of payments , we do a lot with machine learning . Fraud detection is another , and I will say that I 'm so glad we 've had the time to invest and think through all of these foundational capabilities . So , we are now poised and ready to take on the next big leap of changes that are right now at our fingertips , especially in the evolving world of AI and machine learning and of course the public cloud.Laurel : Excellent . Yeah , you 've certainly outlined the diversity of the firm 's offerings . So , when building new technologies and platforms , what are some of the working methodologies and practices that you employ to build at scale and then optimize those workflows ? Vrinda : Yeah , as I said before , the private bank has a lot of offerings , but then amplify that with all the other offerings that JPMorgan Chase , the franchise has , a commercial bank , a corporate and investment bank , a consumer and community bank , and many of our clients cross all of these lines of business . It brings a lot of benefits , but it also has complexities . And one of the things that I obsess personally over is how do we simplify things , not add to the complexity ? Second is a mantra of reuse . Do n't reinvent because it 's easy for technologists to look at a piece of software and say , `` That 's great , but I can build something better . '' Instead , the three things that I ask people to focus on and our organization collectively with our partners focus on is first of all , look at the business outcome . We coach our teams that success and innovation does not come from rebuilding something that somebody has already built , but instead from leveraging it and taking the next leap with additional features upon it to create high impact business outcomes . So , focusing on outcome number one . Second , if you are given a problem , try and look at it from a bigger picture to see whether you can solve the pattern instead of that specific problem . So , I 'll give you an example . We built a chatbot called Casey . It 's one of the most loved products in our private bank right now . And Casey does n't do anything really complex , but what it does is solves a very common pattern , which is ask a few simple questions , get the inputs , join this with data services and join this with execution services and complete the task . And we have hundreds of thousands of tasks that Casey performs every single day . And one of them , especially a very simple functionality , the client wants a bank reference letter . Casey is called upon to do that thousands of times a month . And what used to take three or four hours to produce now takes like a few seconds . So , it suddenly changes the outcome , changes productivity , and changes the happiness of people who are doing things that you know they themselves felt was mundane . So , solving the pattern , again , important . And last but not least , focusing on data is the other thing that 's helped us . Nothing can be improved if you do n't measure it . So , to give you an example of processes , the first thing we did was pick the most complex processes and mapped them out . We understood each step in the process , we understood the purpose of each step in the process , the time taken in each step , we started to question , do you really need this approval from this person ? We observed that for the past six months , not one single thing has been rejected . So , is that even a meaningful approval to begin with ? Questioning if that process could be enhanced with AI , could AI automatically say , `` Yes , please approve , '' or `` There 's a risk in this do not approve , '' or `` It 's okay , it needs a human review . '' And then making those changes in our systems and flows and then obsessively measuring the impact of those changes . All of these have given us a lot of benefits . And I would say we 've made significant progress just with these three principles of focus on outcome , focus on solving the pattern and focus on data and measurements in areas like client onboarding , in areas like maintaining client data , et cetera . So , this has been very helpful for us because in a bank like ours , scale is super important.Laurel : Yeah , that 's a really great explanation . So , when new challenges do come along , like moving to the public cloud , how do you balance the opportunities of that scale , but also computing power and resources within the cost of the actual investment ? How do you ensure that the shifts to the cloud are actually both financially and operationally efficient ? Vrinda : Great question . So obviously every technologist in the world is super excited with the advent of the public cloud . It gives us the powers of agility , economies of scale . We at JPMorgan Chase are able to leverage world class evolving capabilities at our fingertips . We have the ability also to partner with talented technologies at the cloud providers and many service providers that we work with that have advanced solutions that are available first on the public cloud . We are eager to get our hands on those . But with that comes a lot of responsibility because as a bank , we have to worry about security , client data , privacy , resilience , how are we going to operate in a multi-cloud environment because some data has to remain on-prem in our private cloud . So , there 's a lot of complexity , and we have engineers across the board who think a lot about this , and their day and night jobs are to try and figure this out . As we think about moving to the public cloud in my area , I personally spend time thinking in depth about how we could build architectures that are financially efficient . And the reason I bring that up is because traditionally as we think about data centers where our hardware and software has been hosted , developers and architects have n't had to worry about costs because you start with sizing the infrastructure , you order that infrastructure , it 's captive , it remains in the data center , and you can expand it , but it 's a one-time cost each time that you upgrade . With the cloud , that situation changes dramatically . It 's both an opportunity but also a risk . So , a financial lens then becomes super important right at the outset . Let me give you a couple of examples of what I mean . Developers in the public cloud have a lot of power , and with that power comes responsibility . So , I 'm a developer and my application is not working right now because there 's some issue . I have the ability to actually spin up additional processes . I have the ability to spin up additional environments , all of which attract costs , and if I do n't control and manage that , the cost could quickly pile up . Data storage , again , we had fixed storage , we could expand it periodically in the data centers , but in the public cloud , you have choices . You can say data that 's going to be slowly accessed versus data that 's going to be accessed frequently to be stored in different types of storage with different costs as a result . Now think about something like a financial ledger where you have retention requirements of let 's say 20 years . The cost could quickly pile up if you store it in the wrong type of storage . So , there 's an opportunity to optimize cost there , and if you ignore it and you 've not kept an eye on it , you could actually have costs that are just not required . To do this right , we have to ask developers , architects , and our engineers to not just think about the best performance , the most optimal resilience , but also think about cost as a fundamental aspect of how we look at architectures . So , this for me is a huge area of focus , starting with awareness for our people , training our people , thinking about architecture patterns , solution patterns , tooling , measurements , so that we completely stay on top of this and become more effective and more efficient in how we get to the public cloud . While the journey is exciting , I want to make sure that as we land there , we land safely and optimally from a cost standpoint . Laurel : And especially in your position , thinking about how technology will affect the firm years and the future is critical . Therefore , as emerging technologies like AI and machine learning become more commonplace across industries , could you offer an example of how you 're using them in the areas that you cover ? Vrinda : Yeah , certainly . And we use AI/ML at many levels of complexity . So let me start with the base case . AI/ML , especially in operations and client services , starts with can I get data from documents ? Can I OCR those documents , which is optical character recognition ? Can I get information out of it , can I classify it ? Can I perform analytics on it ? So that 's the base case . On top of that , as you look at data , for example , payments data or data of transactions , and let 's say human beings are scanning them for issues or outliers , outlier detection techniques with AI/ML , they are also table stakes now , and many of our systems do that . But as you move on to the next level of prediction , what we 've been able to do is start to build up models where say the client is calling . The client has all these types of cases in progress right now . What could they be calling about in addition to this ? The client expressed sentiment about something that they were not happy with two weeks ago . Is it likely that they 're calling about this ? Can I have that information at the fingertips of the client service agent so they can look at it and respond as soon as the client asks for something ? And think about the next stage of evolution , which is , the client came to us and said , `` Change my title because I just got married . '' Typically , in a transactional kind of activity , you would respond to the client and fix the title from let 's say , Ms. to Mrs. if that 's what they asked you to do . But imagine if when they came to do that , we said to them , here 's 10 other things that you should possibly think of now that you said you 've got married . Congratulations . Do you want to address your beneficiaries ? Do you want to change something in tax planning ? Do you want to change the type of tax calculations that you do because you want to optimize now that you 're married , and you and your spouse could be filing jointly ? Again , not that the client would choose to change those things , but you have an opportunity to be more proactive and think about it holistically so you can address their needs before they even come to you asking for that level of engagement and detail . We also exploit a lot of AI/ML capabilities and in client onboarding to get better data to start to predict what data is right and start to predict risk . And our next leap , I believe strongly , and I 'm super excited about this area of large language models , which I think are going to offer us exponential possibilities , not just in JPMorgan Chase , but as you can see in the world right now with technologies like ChatGPT , OpenAI 's technologies , as well as any of the other publicly available large language models that are being developed every single day . Laurel : Well , it 's clear that AI offers great opportunities for optimizing platforms and transformations . Could you describe the process of how JPMorgan Chase decided to create dedicated teams for AI and machine learning , and how did you build out those teams ? Vrinda : Yeah , certainly . At JPMorgan Chase , we 've been cultivating the mindset for some years now to think AI-first while hiring people . And we also leverage the best talent in the industry , and we 've hired a lot of people in our research divisions as well to work on AI/ML . We 've got thousands , several thousand technologists focused on AI . For me personally , in 2020 , during the first months of the pandemic , I decided that I needed to see more AI/ML activity across my areas . So , I did what I called the “ Summer of AI/ML , ” and this was a fully immersive program that ran over 12 weeks with training for our people , and it was not full-time . So , they would dial in for a couple of hours , get trained on an AI/ML concept and some techniques , and then they would continue that and practice that for the week . Then we had ideation sessions with our users for a couple of weeks and then a hackathon and some brilliant ideas came out of it . But when I stepped back and looked at this whole thing and the results of it , a few months later , I realized that many of the ideas had not reached the final destination into production . And in thinking a little more deeply about that , I understood that we had a problem . The problem was as follows , while AI is a great thing and everybody appreciates it , until AI becomes ingrained in everybody 's brain as the first thing to think about , there 's always going to be a healthy tension between choosing the next best feature on a product , which is very deterministic . If you say , add this button here or add these features using conventional technologies like Java versus game-changing the product using AI , which is a little bit more of a risk , the results are not always predictable , and it requires experimentation and R & D . And so , when you have a choice of incremental changes that are deterministic and changes that are more probabilistic , people tend to take the most certain answer . And so , I decided that I needed to build out a focused , dedicated team of data scientists who were just going to obsess about solving problems in the space of data science and embed them across the products that we were building . And now the results are starting to show for themselves because the work they 've done is phenomenal and the demand on them is growing every single day to the point where I 've grown the team and the value that they 're providing is also measured and visible to the broader organization.Laurel : So , in JPMorgan Chase 's client services , customer experience is clearly a driving force . How do you ensure that your teams are providing clients , especially those high-net-worth private clients that have high expectations of service with services that then meet their banking and account management needs ? Vrinda : So , we obsess over customer experience starting from the CEO down to every single employee . I have three tenets for my team . Number one is client experience , the second is user experience , and third is engineering excellence . And they know that a lot of us are measured by how well we service our clients . So , in the private bank specifically , in addition to reviewing our core capabilities like our case management system , our voice recognition systems , our fraud capture systems , all of that , we continuously analyze data received from client surveys , data received through every single interaction that we have with our client across all channels . So , whether it be a voice channel , whether it be emails , whether it be things that the client types in our websites , the places that they access , and our models just do not look at sentiment , they also look at client experience . And as they look at experience , the things that we are trying to understand are , first of all , how 's the client feeling in this interaction ? But more important is client one and client two and client three feeling the same thing about a particular aspect of our process , and do we need to change that process as a result , or is there more training that needs to be provided to our agents because we are not able to fully satisfy this category of requests ? And by doing that continuously and analyzing it , and back to the point that I made earlier , by measuring it constantly , we are able to say , first of all , how was the experience to begin with ? How is the experience now and after making these changes on these training programs or these fixes in our systems , how is that experience showing ? And some of the other things we are able to do are look at experiences over a period of time . So , for example , the client came to us last year and their experience based on the measurements that we did was at a certain level , they continue to interact with us over a period of months . Has it gone up ? Has it gone down ? How is that needle trending ? How do we take that to superb ? And we 've been able to figure out these in ways that we 've been able to prevent complaints , for example , and get to a point where things are escalated to the right people in the organization , especially in the servicing space where we are able to triage and manage these things more effectively because we are a high- touch client business , and we need to make sure that our clients are extremely happy with us . Laurel : Oh yeah , absolutely . And sort of like another phase or idea when we 're thinking about customer experience and customer services , building a workforce that can respond to it . So here we 're going to talk a bit about how we promote diversity , which has been a tenet of your career , and you currently sit on the board of the Transition Network , which is a nonprofit that empowers a diverse network of women throughout career transitions . So , at JPMorgan Chase , how do you grow talent and improve representation across the company ? And then how does that help build better customer experience ? Vrinda : Sure , that 's a great question . I certainly am very passionate about diversity , and during the past 15 years of my career , I 've spent a lot of time supporting diversity . In my prior firm , I was co-head of the Asian Professional Network . Then subsequently for the past three years , I 've been a board member at the Transition Network , which is all about women in transition . Meaning as they grow out of their careers into retirement and into other stages of life , how do we help them transition ? And then here at JPMorgan Chase , I 'm the sponsor for what is called the Take It Forward initiative , which is an initiative that supports 15,000 women technologists . JPMorgan Chase , as you know , does a broad range of activities in the area of diversity across all kinds of business resource groups , and we invest a lot of time and energy . But specifically , for the Take It Forward initiative that I sponsor , it plays a key role in helping these 15,000 women technologists continuously enhance their leadership skills , grow their technical skills , build their confidence , develop networks , learn from senior sponsors and mentors , grow their careers , all of which makes their work experience very enriching . When I hear things like I 'm motivated , I get new energy interacting with these senior women , I trust my personal power more . I 'm confident to negotiate with my manager for a better role ; I feel confident that I can discuss my compensation . It makes me really happy , and especially when they say I stay in JPMorgan Chase because of Take It Forward , it brings tears to my eyes . It 's really one of the most amazing volunteer driven initiatives in this organization . And a lot of people pour in passion , energy , time to make it succeed . And this initiative has won many awards as well externally . I strongly believe all of these efforts are critical as it changes when people 's experiences change and when they 're happy , what they do becomes that much more effective . And it changes how we work internally , how we present ourselves externally and game changes our business outcomes . I 've seen that in problem solving meetings . When you evaluate risk and you bring in people from diverse backgrounds , some are more risk averse , some are more risk taking , and you suddenly see that dynamic play out and the outcome becomes much different from what it would 've been if you did n't have all those people in the mix . So overall , I strongly believe in this , and I 've seen it play out in every single firm that I 've ever worked at . So that 's my take on diversity and how it helps us . Laurel : Well , it certainly is important work , especially as it ties so tightly with the firm 's own ethos . So Vrinda , looking forward , how do you envision the future of private banking and client management ? As we see emerging technologies become more prevalent and enterprises start to shift their infrastructure to the public cloud ? Vrinda : As I mentioned earlier , I see the next set of emerging technologies taking the world on a super exciting ride , and I think it 's going to be as transformational as the advent of the world wide web . Just take the example of large language models . The areas that are most likely to be first disrupted will be any work that involves content creation because that is table stakes for a large language model . As I expand that to my work , the rest of my work , client services and operations and many other areas that require repetitive work and large-scale interpretation and synthesis of information , that 's again , table stakes for large language models . Expand that now to the next evolution , which is agents that are now the emerging technology with large language models . When agents are provided with a suite of tools and they can use reasoning like humans to decide which tool to execute based on input , that 'll game change the whole thing I was talking about earlier on workflow and task execution and operationally intense activities in the organization . When I look at myself as a software developer in the areas of code generation , code testing , code correction , test data generation , just to name a few , all of those are going to be game changed . So not just the work that our users do in the private bank , but the work that we do as technologists in the private bank . A lot of that is going to game change dramatically . And then you add on the next level , which is problem solving . Large language models are continuously being trained on all subjects ever known to humans . And that for me is the most fascinating part of this . It 's like hundreds of thousands of brains that are working together on a diverse set of subjects . So , imagine a model that 's been trained on a domain like medicine or aerospace or defense , and then trying to bring all of that brainpower together to solve a problem in finance . That truly to me is the ultimate gold standard of problem solving . We talked about diverse people in the room coming with different experiences but imagine models that have been trained . You suddenly have breadth , depth , range of diverse knowledge that could never have been contemplated at that scale . And in order to do all of this , obviously one of the key underpinnings is the public cloud and being able to spin up compute as quickly as possible to do complex calculations and then spin it down when you do n't need it , which is where the public cloud becomes super important . So , all I can say in conclusion is I think this is an amazing time to be in technology , and I just can not wait to see how we further step up our game in the coming months and years , and things are moving almost at the speed of light now . Every single day , new papers get published and new ideas are coming out building on top of some of the exponential technologies that we are seeing in the world today .

Huawei’s 5G chip breakthrough needs a reality check,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/15/1083413/huaweis-5g-chip-smartphone-sanction/,2023-11-15,"<p>A self-made chip puts Huawei back in the smartphone game, but US sanctions are still hurting the company.</p>
","This story first appeared in China Report, MIT Technology Review’s newsletter about technology in China. Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Tuesday. This is going to be a BIG week for US-China relations: On Wednesday, Xi Jinping will sit down with Joe Biden in San Francisco and talk about military issues, trade, and more. It will be his first visit to the US in six years.  Well, so much has happened since 2017. A harmonious era in US-China relations ended; we’ve seen a trade war, a pandemic, an ongoing technology rivalry, an off-course spy balloon, and too many other tumultuous developments to list here.  It’s in this context that Huawei, the Chinese telecom and technology company, became something of a poster child for souring relations. It was one of the first Chinese tech companies to receive intense scrutiny and become a target for sanctions driven by national security concerns. In fact, many of the ways the US currently deploys sanctions in the US-China tech war are inspired by its success in curbing Huawei. (If you want to know more about the fight over semiconductors, read more from me here and here.) But it’d be a mistake to think Huawei has collapsed. Far from it, in fact. In August—at the same time US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo was visiting China—Huawei suddenly, without any public announcement, shocked the world when it started selling a new flagship phone, the Mate 60 Pro.  The big surprise here was that this phone uses a new 5G chip, even though the company has been blocked from sourcing 5G chips or working with chip factories outside of China since 2020. So regulators in DC and other China hawks panicked that the relatively advanced seven-nanometer chip proved the company had somehow circumvented sanctions.  But had it really? Researchers who broke down the chip believe that it seems to be entirely designed by Huawei and made in China. I’ve been wanting to understand what really happened here—and what it means more broadly for the ongoing competition over chips and other tech. So I recently spoke with Harish Krishnaswamy, a professor at Columbia University who studies telecommunications and chip designs.  The bottom line is that the Mate 60 Pro shows a manufacturing breakthrough on Huawei’s side that puts it back into the smartphone game. “It's clearly wrong to assume that they're not a player because of the sanctions,” Krishnaswamy told me. He explained that the designing of 5G chips is not necessarily difficult for Chinese researchers and companies, so it wouldn’t have been that hard for Huawei to create a 5G chip in the lab. What is much harder is mass-producing a 5G chip at great quality and reasonable costs so it can be used in a consumer product.  Producing advanced 5G chips “is just a very large engineering endeavor that very few companies can pull off,” he says. Only a handful of companies—like Qualcomm (American), MediaTek (Taiwanese), Samsung (South Korean), and HiSilicon (a chip company that is a Huawei subsidiary)—have successfully made 5G modem chips. Even tech giants like Intel and Apple have failed so far to develop in-house 5G chips.  So when the US sanctions blocked companies from supplying chips to Huawei for its phones, the Chinese manufacturer had no choice but to rely on HiSilicon alone.  Aggressive new US policies will be put to the test in 2023. They could ultimately fragment the global semiconductor industry. But the sanctions also cut HiSilicon off from the global network of factories (called “foundries” or “fabs” in the semiconductor industry) that are vital in manufacturing and testing the products. TSMC, the Taiwanese chip fab that was making chips for HiSilicon at the time, stopped supplying it in 2020. This further narrowed the options for Huawei. It could only turn to Chinese fabs, and that was a costly and time-consuming process. “Anytime you’ve designed a chip in a fab and then, for some reason, you cannot source that anymore and move to another company, just that process of redesigning, qualification, and ramping production takes at least three years,” says Krishnaswamy, who also owns a chip company that works closely with fabs.  Then, making things even more challenging for Huawei, Chinese chip fabs were later put under sanctions and now can’t access any cutting-edge chip-making technologies. So when Huawei made the smartphone with a new 5G chip earlier this year, Krishnaswamy says, the industry was surprised by how quickly it had been able to turn around a design, shift to a Chinese fab, manufacture the new chip, and get it to production rate, all while having to deal with significant revenue losses caused by sanctions. “For Huawei to show [that it is] able to do that is definitely impressive,” he says.  Indeed, since news came out that it was making its own 5G chips in Chinese fabs with minimum overseas input, the company has become a source of national pride for many in China. For them, it’s an example of how US sanctions don’t always work as intended. They may force Chinese companies to adapt, move production back to China, and catch up in areas of tech where they had lagged—and that can ultimately work out in China’s favor. Still, it may be too early for them to cheer, as there are other obstacles to clear before Huawei can become competitive in the high-end phone market again. “After any company shows proof of life—basically, that they have a chip—the long-term success is really governed by the ability to source [it] in large volumes and get the costs down over time,” Krishnaswamy says. Huawei is experiencing a reality check right now. A few months after the release of the new model, domestic enthusiasm has been hurt by the fact that it’s still very difficult for consumers to get a phone. They are back-ordered for months because of a supply shortage. In fact, just this past weekend, which was China’s equivalent of Black Friday, the top-selling phones were still from Apple and Xiaomi (another Chinese brand). At the end of the day, for any chance of regaining its dominant position in the smartphone market, Huawei needs to compete with Qualcomm and Samsung to reliably make better and cheaper chips, and that’s very difficult to pull off. The US chip blockade, which is consistently being expanded and strengthened, will only make it harder in the future—even if it hasn’t made it impossible thus far. Unless the Biden-Xi meeting produces some truly surprising results this week, the bitter winter of US-China relations may continue for years. In which case there are a lot more battles ahead for Chinese companies like Huawei, and one breakthrough in chip manufacturing won’t be enough.  Do you think Huawei still has a chance in the global smartphone market? Let me know your thoughts at zeyi@technologyreview.com. 1. Xi wanted to dine with American business leaders in San Francisco before he met with Biden. The White House rejected the proposal, part of a lengthy back-and-forth over the visit’s agenda. (Wall Street Journal $) 2. A Chinese university tapped Hikvision, the surveillance camera company, to build a smart campus project last year. It includes an alert system that flags ethnic minority students who choose to fast during Ramadan. (IPVM) 3. As Huawei builds up its Harmony Operating System to replace the now-embargoed Android system, Chinese tech companies are quickly recruiting developers who understand HarmonyOS. (South China Morning Post $) 4. The Nepali government decided to ban TikTok, claiming that the app has spread discord and disturbed social harmony. (Nepali Times) 5. After Chinese hobbyist drones were heavily used in the war in Ukraine, the Israeli military is now stockpiling them to use in its war. (Wall Street Journal $) 6. A new bipartisan bill in Congress seeks to block the US government from doing business with Tether, the issuer of a major stablecoin called USDT, because Tether’s parent company is based in Hong Kong. (Coindesk) 7. Baidu ordered 1,600 AI chips from Huawei as an alternative to Nvidia’s A100 chip to use in servers, showing how Chinese companies cope with the bottleneck on computing power. (Reuters $)  8. The founder of a major Chinese game-streaming website is apparently being held by the police. It could be related to an investigation of porn and gambling content on the platform. (Financial Times $) This year, many Chinese smartphone users found themselves pestered by a new form of advertising: whenever they shook their phone, intentionally or not, the e-commerce app would automatically open.  It turns out this is the latest marketing trick that exploits the gyroscope function in modern-day phones, which detects movement to calculate steps or find directions. Late last year, some Chinese tech companies came up with an industry standard on the technical specifications for how to open a new app when movement is detected. It quickly started being deployed to spam users with ads, and it has drawn widespread complaints. According to the Chinese publication Time Finance, Apple has become aware of the phenomenon and instructed several top Chinese apps to ban the practice starting this month. But it’s hard to say whether that’s enough to prevent more apps from following suit. A traveler ordered food delivery to his hotel room in China but never got it. Eventually, he received a call asking for help—the robot that was carrying his food had tripped and couldn’t get up. Maybe robots will eventually rule the world, but fortunately, not today.  Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot about this æœ‹å‹åœˆ latelyâ€¦ the guy ordered delivery to the room at a hotel, called down and concierge said it had already been sent up, but eventually he gets a call from the delivery robot asking for helpâ€¦ #china #robotwars pic.twitter.com/Miy6Ibyvku","This story first appeared in China Report , MIT Technology Review ’ s newsletter about technology in China .

Indeed , since news came out that it was making its own 5G chips in Chinese fabs with minimum overseas input , the company has become a source of national pride for many in China . For them , it ’ s an example of how US sanctions don ’ t always work as intended . They may force Chinese companies to adapt , move production back to China , and catch up in areas of tech where they had lagged—and that can ultimately work out in China ’ s favor . Still , it may be too early for them to cheer , as there are other obstacles to clear before Huawei can become competitive in the high-end phone market again . “ After any company shows proof of life—basically , that they have a chip—the long-term success is really governed by the ability to source [ it ] in large volumes and get the costs down over time , ” Krishnaswamy says . Huawei is experiencing a reality check right now . A few months after the release of the new model , domestic enthusiasm has been hurt by the fact that it ’ s still very difficult for consumers to get a phone . They are back-ordered for months because of a supply shortage . In fact , just this past weekend , which was China ’ s equivalent of Black Friday , the top-selling phones were still from Apple and Xiaomi ( another Chinese brand ) . At the end of the day , for any chance of regaining its dominant position in the smartphone market , Huawei needs to compete with Qualcomm and Samsung to reliably make better and cheaper chips , and that ’ s very difficult to pull off . The US chip blockade , which is consistently being expanded and strengthened , will only make it harder in the future—even if it hasn ’ t made it impossible thus far . Unless the Biden-Xi meeting produces some truly surprising results this week , the bitter winter of US-China relations may continue for years . In which case there are a lot more battles ahead for Chinese companies like Huawei , and one breakthrough in chip manufacturing won ’ t be enough . Do you think Huawei still has a chance in the global smartphone market ? Let me know your thoughts at zeyi @ technologyreview.com . 1 . Xi wanted to dine with American business leaders in San Francisco before he met with Biden . The White House rejected the proposal , part of a lengthy back-and-forth over the visit ’ s agenda .

( Reuters $ ) 8 . The founder of a major Chinese game-streaming website is apparently being held by the police . It could be related to an investigation of porn and gambling content on the platform . ( Financial Times $ ) This year , many Chinese smartphone users found themselves pestered by a new form of advertising : whenever they shook their phone , intentionally or not , the e-commerce app would automatically open . It turns out this is the latest marketing trick that exploits the gyroscope function in modern-day phones , which detects movement to calculate steps or find directions . Late last year , some Chinese tech companies came up with an industry standard on the technical specifications for how to open a new app when movement is detected . It quickly started being deployed to spam users with ads , and it has drawn widespread complaints . According to the Chinese publication Time Finance , Apple has become aware of the phenomenon and instructed several top Chinese apps to ban the practice starting this month . But it ’ s hard to say whether that ’ s enough to prevent more apps from following suit . A traveler ordered food delivery to his hotel room in China but never got it .

The grassroots push to digitize India’s most precious documents,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/25/1081572/india-digitize-rare-documents-internet-archive-library-servants-of-knowledge/,2023-10-25,"<p>The Servants of Knowledge collection on the Internet Archive is an effort to make up for the lack of library resources in India.</p>
","On a bright sunny day in August, in a second-floor room at the Gandhi Bhavan Museum in Bengaluru, workers sit in front of five giant tabletop scanners, lining up books and flipping pages with foot pedals. The museum building houses the largest reference library for Gandhian philosophy in the state of Karnataka, and over the next year, the large assortment of books—including the collected works of Mahatma Gandhi, a translation of his autobiography, Experiments with Truth, into the Kannada language, and other rare items—will be digitized and their metadata recorded before they join the Servants of Knowledge (SoK) collection on the Internet Archive.  This digitization push is just the latest for the SoK, which was established about four years ago with a volunteer effort to preserve hard-to-find resources. It has since expanded to include partnerships with various libraries and archives throughout India. Today, the SoK collection is a searchable library of books, speeches, magazines, newspapers, palm leaf manuscripts, audio, and film from and about India in over 15 languages. The collection is a truly open digital library containing public-domain and out-of-copyright works on science, literature, law, politics, history, religion, music, and folklore, among many other topics. All content is open access, searchable, downloadable, and accessible to visually challenged people using text-to-speech tools. Volunteers and staff continue to expand the collection, scanning about 1.4 million pages per month in various locations across Bengaluru, and more collaborations are in the works. The collection is an effort to make up for the scarcity of library resources in India. There are about 50,000 public-funded libraries in this country of over 1.4 billion people, according to the Raja Rammohun Roy Library Foundation, a group established by the Indian government to promote the public-library movement there. Village and tribal libraries may contain just a few thousand books, compared with a median 77,000 books in each state’s central library and 24,000 in every district library, according to a 2018 report by the foundation. Some libraries have lost their collections to fire. A number of books have been ruined by neglect. Others have gone missing. Some people are finding their accounts permanently blocked Moreover, most public libraries aren’t freely accessible to the public. “Getting access to many of our public libraries is so difficult, and after a point people will give up asking for access. That’s the case in many of our public-funded educational institutes too,” says Arul George Scaria, an associate professor at the National Law School of India University Bengaluru, who studies intellectual-property law. One of the best ways to liberate access to these libraries, he says, is through digitization. Technologist Omshivaprakash H L felt the acute lack of such resources when he needed references for writing Wikipedia articles in Kannada, a southwestern Indian language. Around 2019, he heard that Carl Malamud, who runs Public Resource, a registered US charity, was already archiving books like Gandhi’s Hind Swaraj collection on Indian self-rule and works of the Indian government in the public domain. “I also knew that he used to buy a lot of these books from secondhand bookstores and take them to the US to get them digitized,” says Omshivaprakash.  Public Resource had been working with the Indian Academy of Sciences, Bengaluru, to digitize its books using a scanner provided by the Internet Archive, but the efforts had tapered off. Omshivaprakash proposed engaging community members to help. During the weekends, these volunteers began scanning some of the books Omshivaprakash had and that Malamud had bought. “Carl really understood the idea of community collaboration, the idea of local language technology that we needed, and the kind of impact we were creating,” Omshivaprakash says. The scanners use a V-shaped cradle to hold the books and two DSLR cameras to capture the pages in high resolution. The device is based on the Internet Archive’s scanner but was reengineered by Omshivaprakash and manufactured in India at a lower cost. Each worker can scan about 800 pages an hour.  The more crucial parts of the operation happen after the scan: volunteers make sure to apply accurate metadata to make the scans findable on the Internet Archive, and optical character recognition, which has been fine-tuned to work better for a range of Indian language scripts, makes the text searchable and accessible through text-to-speech programs. Public Resource funds the SoK project, and Omshivaprakash manages the operation, with the help of staff and volunteers. Collaborators have come through social media and word of mouth. For instance, a community member and Kannada teacher named Chaya Acharya approached Omshivaprakash with newspaper clippings of work by her grandfather, the renowned journalist and writer Pavem Acharya, who wrote articles on science and social issues as well as satirical essays. Unexpectedly, she found more articles by her grandfather in the existing Servants of Knowledge collection. “Simply by searching his name, I got many more articles from the archive,” she says. She began collecting copies of Kasturi, a prominent Kannada monthly magazine that Pavem Acharya had edited from 1952 to early 1975, and gave them to Omshivaprakash for digitizing. The old issues of the magazine contain rare writings and translations by popular Kannada authors, such as Indirabai by Gulavadi Venkata Rao, regarded as the first modern novel in Kannada, and a Kannada translation of Edgar Allan Poe’s famous short story “The Gold-Bug.” This is all part of a vision of a public library on the internet as “a bottom-up, grassroots thing,” Malamud says. “It’s a bunch of people teaching each other. We just want to keep scanning and making [these materials] available to people. It’s not a grand goal or single aim.  “It’s what we do for a living,” he says. “We have done it for years, and we are gonna keep doing it for years.” Ananya is a freelance science and technology journalist based in Bengaluru, India.

","Every academic field has its superstars. But a rare few achieve superstardom not just by demonstrating individual excellence but also by consistently producing future superstars. A notable example of such a legendary doctoral advisor is the Princeton physicist John Archibald Wheeler. A dissertation was once written about his mentorship, and he advised Richard Feynman, Kip Thorne, Hugh Everett (who proposed the “many worlds” theory of quantum mechanics), and a host of others who could collectively staff a top-tier physics department. In ecology, there is Bob Paine, who discovered that certain “keystone species” have an outsize impact on the environment and started a lineage of influential ecologists. And in journalism, there is John McPhee, who has taught generations of accomplished journalists at Princeton since 1975.  Computer science has its own such figure: Manuel Blum, who won the 1995 Turing Award—the Nobel Prize of computer science. Blum’s métier is theoretical computer science, a field that often escapes the general public’s radar. But you certainly have come across one of Blum’s creations: the “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart,” better known as thecaptcha—a test designed to distinguish humans from bots online. Scientists hope to leverage mRNA for a bevy of vaccines and therapeutics.  “I don’t know what his secret has been. But he has been a tremendously successful advisor,” says Michael Sipser, a theoretical computer scientist at MIT who was advised by Blum, referring to the “extraordinary number of PhD students” who have worked with him and then gone on to make an impact in the field. “It is extraordinary in the literal sense of that word—outside the ordinary.” Three of Blum’s students have also won Turing Awards; many have received other high honors in theoretical computer science, such as the Gödel Prize and the Knuth Prize; and more than 20 hold professorships at top computer science departments. There are five, for example, at MIT and three at Carnegie Mellon University (where there were four until one left to found Duolingo).  Blum is also distinguished by the great plurality of subfields that his students work in. When Mor Harchol-Balter, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon, arrived at the University of California, Berkeley, as a PhD student, she quickly realized that she wanted to work with him. “Manuel was warm, smiling, and just immediately emanated kindness,” Harchol-Balter told me. Her specialty, queueing theory, had little overlap with Blum’s, but he took her on. “Every professor I know, if you start working on what’s way out of their area, they would tell you to go find somebody else,” she said. “Not Manuel.”   A few months ago, as I was reading about some of the most significant yet counterintuitive ideas in modern theoretical computer science, I realized that the vast majority of the researchers responsible for that work had been advised by Blum. I wondered whether there might be some formula to his success. Of course, it’s presumptuous to think such an intimately human process can be distilled into an algorithm. However, conversations with his students gave me a sense of his approach and revealed consistent themes. Many spoke warmly of him: I often heard some version of “I could talk about Manuel all day” or “Manuel is my favorite topic of conversation.” The finer points of mentorship aside, what I learned was at least proof that kindness can beget greatness.  Manuel Blum is married to Lenore Blum, an accomplished mathematician and computer scientist, who has also been at the forefront of promoting diversity in math and computing (among other things, she founded America’s first computer science department at a women’s college and helped CMU’s computer science department achieve 50-50 gender parity). They are both now emeritus professors at CMU and Manuel Blum is an emeritus professor at UC Berkeley; they split their time between the two coasts.  One day in August, I joined the couple for breakfast at their house in Pittsburgh. Breezy in his manner, Blum, at 85, still has a schoolboy’s smile and frequently erupts into a resonant laugh; he is charismatic in a way typical of people who are utterly oblivious to their charisma. (When he says “WON-derful,” which he frequently does, you can practically hear “WON” in all caps.)  The Blums, who recently celebrated their 62nd anniversary, still shuttlecock research ideas, enthuse over emails from their former students, and complete each other’s memories—some dating from their life in Venezuela, where they met as kids.  Manuel Blum was born in 1938 in Caracas to Jewish parents who had moved from Romania. His first language was German, which his parents spoke at home. But when they moved to the Bronx, his family realized that people did not want to hear German spoken. The year was 1942, and the country was at war. After switching to Spanish at home, he quickly lost his fluency in German. But when he had to learn English for school, he soon forgot Spanish as well. At one point, Blum says, he was listening to both languages but found himself understanding neither. “I remember thinking to myself, ‘Very interesting—I don’t have a language. I couldn’t express myself through language. How was it that I was able to think?’” he told me. In a lucid moment of metacognition—an act that befits a future theorist of abstract concepts—he realized: You don’t need language to think. “He is completely original and goes off and does what he thinks is interesting and important. And often it turns out to be something really significant.” Likely because of his language difficulties, Blum’s second-grade teacher warned his mother that while he might manage to complete high school, he might not go to college. “But I wanted to be smarter. So I asked my father, ‘What can I do to get smarter?’” His father answered that if he understood how the brain works, he could be smart. The conversation marked the inception of Blum’s interest in studying consciousness (something he and Lenore Blum now research full-time, often assisted by their son, the computer scientist Avrim Blum).  Blum was ultimately accepted to MIT, but he struggled the first year, until a friend noticed that his approach to studying physics—owing to Blum’s training at a military academy he went to before college—was heavy on memorization. Blum recalls his friend saying, “You don’t memorize. You memorize only ‘F = ma’ and a few things like that. When you need a formula, you derive it.” Soon, his grades started climbing. “I went from being a Xerox machine to being a thinker. I really enjoyed thinking,” he says. To pursue his interest in the brain, Blum took a course that involved reading multiple volumes of the standard edition of Freud’s works. But they didn’t offer much in the way of satisfactory answers. Then his professor told him that he should introduce himself to Warren S. McCulloch, known for very early research on neural networks and pioneering work in cybernetics. Blum read some of McCulloch’s papers and was able to prove a couple of theorems in mathematical biophysics, and McCulloch took him on in his MIT lab. “A wonderful person. A magnanimous person. Anything I wanted to do, he was supportive,” Blum says.  McCulloch’s lab focused on both the rigorous mathematical work of modeling the neuron and the experimental process of studying the brain to understand how it functions. But what Blum couldn’t study in the lab was consciousness. The topic was taboo at the time. Many felt that subjective mental phenomena weren’t fit for scientific inquiry, and there were few tools available in any case. (The fMRI, for example, which is an imaging technique that maps brain activity, wouldn’t be developed until 1990.)  Blum would revisit the topic occasionally as he transitioned away from electrical engineering to mathematics and computer science in graduate school. As he pursued his graduate work at MIT, he became captivated by a branch of theoretical computer science known as recursive function theory—now more commonly referred to as computability theory—and began searching for a thesis advisor. Soon, he found Marvin Minsky, the mathematician and computer scientist, who was a pioneer of artificial intelligence. Minsky (who had an office full of mechanical hands) often dropped by McCulloch’s lab to demonstrate his new machines and discuss mathematical problems.  After studying computational complexity and computability for his thesis, Blum received his PhD in 1964. At the time, computational complexity theory represented the hinterlands of computer science. It wasn’t until 1971 that Stephen Cook formulated the foundational question of the field, “P vs. NP”—which essentially asks whether every problem whose solution can be checked quickly can also be solved quickly.  But Blum found a productive home in Berkeley’s electrical engineering and computer science department. At MIT, he had helped form the contours of computational complexity theory. At Berkeley, he showed how this highly abstract field could also have useful applications in areas such as cryptography and program checking—a method that uses an algorithm to verify the correctness of a computer program. The kinds of questions Blum poses read like paradoxes and have a somewhat playful quality, making complexity theory and cryptography sound almost like a subgenre of sci-fi. “He is completely original and goes off and does what he thinks is interesting and important. And often it turns out to be something really significant,” Sipser told me.  In his seminal paper “Coin Flipping by Telephone,” the question that he poses is: “Alice and Bob want to flip a coin by telephone. (They have just divorced, live in different cities, and want to decide who gets the car.)” Let’s say that Alice calls “heads” and Bob says she lost; how does she trust that he is being truthful? And how could Bob trust Alice if the situation were reversed? What sounds like a riddle addresses a fundamental problem in cryptography: How can two parties engage in trustworthy exchanges over a communication channel in such a way that neither party can cheat?  Blum showed that this can be achieved using the concept of “commitment.” In a simplified analogy, the idea is that Alice gives Bob a locked box with her prediction inside, but without the key. This prevents Alice from altering her prediction and stops Bob from discovering Alice’s guess prematurely. Once Bob tosses the coin, Alice hands over the key to open the box.  When you ask Blum about the secrets of good mentorship, he reacts with a sheepish head scratch, attributing his students’ success to their own talents. “Students come up with wonderful ideas, and people don’t realize how wonderful they are. The only thing I can say is that, more than most, I really enjoy the ideas that the students have,” he told me. “I have learned from each of them.”  His response left me puzzled, especially after I heard from his students that Blum never criticized their ideas or prescribed research directions. Offering full autonomy and boundless encouragement sounded wonderful in theory, but I was mystified as to how it worked in practice—how did students receive the occasional course correction or hyper-specific advice that is often essential in academic pursuits? Still, it’s not that he was dodging my question. He is not so much a magician who refuses to give away his tricks as one who is himself astonished by what has been conjured around him. One thing I came to understand about Blum’s advising style is that when he says “Students are here to teach me,” he truly means it, with all that entails. While it’s easy to pay lip service to the principle of “treating a student as a colleague,” Ryan Williams, a professor of computer science at MIT who studied with Blum, told me that working together made him really feel like one. What this means, in concrete terms, is that Blum imparted to his students a sense of pedagogical responsibility: he was really expecting to learn from them at every weekly meeting, which in turn meant they had to understand their ideas to the bone.  “During my first few months of working with him, I thought he was testing me. And then I realized that was just him,” Russell Impagliazzo, a professor of computer science at the University of California, San Diego, told me. “You had to learn how to say things so that Manuel could understand them. And that’s the most valuable skill that he gives his students, like the skill of learning to swim by being thrown into a pool: the ability to translate what you’re saying into more concrete terms. This skill proves invaluable when you are teaching a class or writing a grant proposal.” Former students describe Blum as unwaveringly positive, saying he had other ways besides criticism to steer them away from dead ends. “He is always smiling, but you can see he smiles wider when he likes something. And oh, we wanted that big smile,” says Ronitt Rubinfeld, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT. What would it be like to have someone like Blum in your corner? What kinds of audacious ideas can take root when someone listens to you with absolutely no judgment? Behind the general positivity, Rubinfeld says, is a fine taste for interesting ideas. Students could trust they were being guided in the right direction. Come up with a boring idea? Blum, who is known for his terrible memory, would have mostly forgotten it by your next meeting.  When Harchol-Balter was in graduate school, she says, Blum never told her what to work on and instead guided her by means of questions: “Manuel is fantastic at asking questions. Manuel excels at asking questions.” Blum also “really makes sure that each student has a special area to develop,” Lenore Blum told me. “I don’t think he’s asked a student to ever do the next iteration of someone else’s work,” she said. “But he’ll say, ‘Work with me, and we’ll do something brand new.’” Working on a new idea is risky. But Blum’s encouragement, coupled with his track record of spotting fruitful lines of inquiry, gave his students confidence to keep going in bold directions while enduring criticism and self-doubt. “There’s a huge difference [between] Manuel’s advising style and everyone else’s in the world,” says Impagliazzo. “Manuel’s advising style is simply to listen to you and make you seem really, really important. Like what you’re doing is the most amazing thing in the world.”  Harchol-Balter says this is the magic she is now trying to emulate with her students. “Whenever I had an idea, whatever it was, he somehow made me feel like this was the most brilliant idea that had ever been invented,” she remembers. She felt that every idea could be “a multimillion-dollar breakthrough,” which allowed her to stay committed to her line of research, undeterred by external influences or trends. “He creates this feeling of supreme confidence—not just confidence, but like, ‘You. Are. Brilliant,’” she adds. “Having somebody beside you all those six years, when you’re feeling the most vulnerable, constantly boosting your confidence … It’s amazing. And that’s why his students are so great.” Astronomy is leading the way in making science more accessible through sonification—and the results sound amazing. Excellence in academia, as in many other fields, is about both what you do and how you do it. You need to identify a promising topic and have the technical ability to execute it. A technically flawless idea without original insight can be trivial; a radically original idea without proper execution might never fully develop, while a bold idea powered by misplaced confidence could hit a dead end.  The psychological reassurance students get from Blum may come in part from his superhuman level of aplomb. “He never seems stressed out,” says his son, Avrim Blum. “In the real world, there are deadlines and stresses, but he never showed any of that. At least I never saw it.” I’m still awed by his ability to mask inner turbulence—something that affects everyone—so well that it remains invisible even to his closest observers, including his own son. It’s a source of stability that students can rely on throughout their graduate studies. “I was more comfortable and more relaxed in grad school because I felt like he had things under control for me,” Williams told me. “If there were any difficulties, he would help. He had my back. He was going to sort things out.”  Speaking with Blum’s students, I felt a pang of jealousy. What would it be like to have someone like Blum in your corner during your most vulnerable moments? And how many direct criticisms you’ve faced could have been reformulated into questions? What kinds of audacious ideas can take root when someone listens to you with absolutely no judgment?  But even as Blum’s students claim they are still bewildered by the “magic” and “mystery” of their advisor’s approach, they have become accomplished teachers and advisors in their own right. Umesh Vazirani, a theoretical computer scientist at Berkeley, told me that he has thought a lot about Blum’s secrets. He said the essence can be expressed this way: “You respect every student, and you let them develop into whatever they want to be.” Vazirani, who has advised a number of superstars in the field himself, believes that in education, “the most important thing is not to break anything. Cause no damage.” The potency of the Blumian approach to advising isn’t domain specific, as illustrated by George Saunders’s reflections on his writing teacher, Tobias Wolff. Writing teachers have “so much power,” Saunders has written: They could mock us, disregard us, use us to prop themselves up. But ourteachers, if they are good, instead do something almost holy, which we neverforget: they take us seriously. They accept us as new members of the guild.They tolerate the under-wonderful stories we write, the dopy things we say, ourshaky-legged aesthetic theories, our posturing, because they have been therethemselves.  We say: I think I might be a writer.  They say: Good for you. Proceed.   On my last day in Pittsburgh, I noticed a photo of Blum’s old advisor, Warren S. McCulloch, behind Blum’s desk in his home office. It was in a prominent place where someone else might’ve chosen to display a family heirloom or showcase an autographed photo of himself shaking a president’s hand. (McCulloch died in 1969, only a few years after Blum began his professorship.) Out of curiosity, I pointed out the photo’s prominent position. “Yes, because he is always with me,” Blum replied. “Warren was Manuel’s spiritual father in every way,” added Lenore. As I made my way back to the airport, I remembered a book called Surviving Death, by the philosopher Mark Johnston. In the book, Johnston postulates that a good person could “quite literally” survive death by redirecting self-interest toward the well-being of future people. This forfeiture doesn’t spell the dissolution of the self but, rather, the expansion of it, allowing the person to live on in the “onward rush of humankind.” A line from the book unfolded, with a time-release effect, in my head: “Every time a baby is born, a good person acquires a new face.”  Behind every one of Blum’s knowing smiles, it may well have been McCulloch himself, nodding, imparting a blessing: “Wonderful idea. Proceed.”  Sheon Han is a writer based in Palo Alto, California.","Every academic field has its superstars .

It ’ s a source of stability that students can rely on throughout their graduate studies . “ I was more comfortable and more relaxed in grad school because I felt like he had things under control for me , ” Williams told me . “ If there were any difficulties , he would help . He had my back . He was going to sort things out. ” Speaking with Blum ’ s students , I felt a pang of jealousy . What would it be like to have someone like Blum in your corner during your most vulnerable moments ? And how many direct criticisms you ’ ve faced could have been reformulated into questions ? What kinds of audacious ideas can take root when someone listens to you with absolutely no judgment ? But even as Blum ’ s students claim they are still bewildered by the “ magic ” and “ mystery ” of their advisor ’ s approach , they have become accomplished teachers and advisors in their own right . Umesh Vazirani , a theoretical computer scientist at Berkeley , told me that he has thought a lot about Blum ’ s secrets . He said the essence can be expressed this way : “ You respect every student , and you let them develop into whatever they want to be. ” Vazirani , who has advised a number of superstars in the field himself , believes that in education , “ the most important thing is not to break anything . Cause no damage. ” The potency of the Blumian approach to advising isn ’ t domain specific , as illustrated by George Saunders ’ s reflections on his writing teacher , Tobias Wolff . Writing teachers have “ so much power , ” Saunders has written : They could mock us , disregard us , use us to prop themselves up . But ourteachers , if they are good , instead do something almost holy , which we neverforget : they take us seriously . They accept us as new members of the guild.They tolerate the under-wonderful stories we write , the dopy things we say , ourshaky-legged aesthetic theories , our posturing , because they have been therethemselves . We say : I think I might be a writer . They say : Good for you . Proceed . On my last day in Pittsburgh , I noticed a photo of Blum ’ s old advisor , Warren S. McCulloch , behind Blum ’ s desk in his home office . It was in a prominent place where someone else might ’ ve chosen to display a family heirloom or showcase an autographed photo of himself shaking a president ’ s hand . ( McCulloch died in 1969 , only a few years after Blum began his professorship . ) Out of curiosity , I pointed out the photo ’ s prominent position . “ Yes , because he is always with me , ” Blum replied . “ Warren was Manuel ’ s spiritual father in every way , ” added Lenore . As I made my way back to the airport , I remembered a book called Surviving Death , by the philosopher Mark Johnston . In the book , Johnston postulates that a good person could “ quite literally ” survive death by redirecting self-interest toward the well-being of future people . This forfeiture doesn ’ t spell the dissolution of the self but , rather , the expansion of it , allowing the person to live on in the “ onward rush of humankind. ” A line from the book unfolded , with a time-release effect , in my head : “ Every time a baby is born , a good person acquires a new face. ” Behind every one of Blum ’ s knowing smiles , it may well have been McCulloch himself , nodding , imparting a blessing : “ Wonderful idea . Proceed. ” Sheon Han is a writer based in Palo Alto , California .","['academic', 'field', 'superstar', 'rare', 'achieve', 'superstardom', 'demonstrate', 'individual', 'excellence', 'also',

Death to captchas,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/24/1081139/captchas-ai-websites-computing/,2023-10-24,"<p>Proving you’re human on websites is harder than ever—but alternative tests are gaining ground.</p>
","Earlier this year, HBO Max users hoping to sign in to the service had to pass an audio challenge in which they listened to a bunch of tunes and had to select the one with a repeating pattern. When I signed in to LinkedIn recently, it asked me to prove I’m human with an unusual puzzle. With a set of left and right buttons, I had to turn a 3D image of a pink dog until it faced the direction that a hand next to it was pointing.  Websites use these captchas (the name comes from “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart”) to tell whether a user is human or machine. You’ve likely noticed they have only gotten more difficult and more involved. That’s because of what happens after we solve a captcha: the data from our efforts to label those blurry grids of traffic lights, text, or buses is used to train AI systems, which then get better at defeating captchas, tricking systems into thinking they are human.  The arms race between humans and machines has been progressing for a while. As early as 2016, researchers at Columbia University showed they could solve Google’s image captchas with 70% accuracy using off-the-shelf automated image recognition tools, the sort that could readily be used by bot designers.  Captchas have gotten more complex out of necessity. Because as AI gets more sophisticated, they’ve become less effective. By now, some captchas have gotten a little surreal. A company called hCaptcha recently tasked people with identifying an object that doesn’t exist—a “Yoko,” which seems to be an AI-generated yo-yo with a roughly snail-like appearance.   Tech firms and consumers alike feel it’s time for a change. For one thing, legacy captchas (which are still in use) just don’t work anymore: “Clicking images such as buses and street signs is outdated,” Ashish Jain, the CTO of Arkose Labs, the firm behind those LinkedIn and HBO captchas, told MIT Technology Review. “Bots have evolved, but legacy captchas haven’t.” Even more convoluted mini-games may not be enough to keep AI at bay. In one instance, a chatbot (guided by humans) pretended to be visually impaired and managed to hire a human to solve a captcha for it.  Mauro Migliardi, a professor of software engineering at the University of Padua, believes captcha designers will have to go a step further in order to stay ahead of machines. Because AIs can be trained to tackle any cognitive task, he says, we may need to transition to physical challenges, like requiring users to rotate their phones or move them in a certain way as they would in a video game.  It’s a practice that could introduce further errors into already error-prone models. That might solve some problems, but it would create others. The more complicated the challenge, the more cumbersome it is to do what you want to do on the web. And some approaches might shut some users out. “It’s actually really hard to build a challenge like this that is friendly to the whole human population,” Jess Leroy, senior director of product management at Google Cloud, wrote in an e-mail. “There are many reasons why something that may be obvious or easy to one person may be difficult to another.” Those include disabilities and cultural differences. In the long term, we may see captchas abandoned altogether. Companies such as Google and Cloudflare have already quietly switched to “invisible” challenges, which monitor online fingerprints of human behavior, like cursor motions or browsing behavior, to differentiate a person from a bot. If these sorts of signals convince the software you are human, you won’t have to solve a captcha.  This approach raises privacy concerns: such signals can allow advertisers and websites to track what you are doing online. An alternative could come from a coalition of companies, including Google, Fastly, Cloudflare, and Apple, that has developed a more privacy-friendly mechanism called Privacy Pass. Before we even open a browser and run into a captcha challenge, we perform numerous actions on our phones and computers—like unlocking them with our faces—that are hard for a bot to imitate. On a Privacy Pass–enabled website, our devices take all that information and attest for us—allowing us to skip the captcha altogether. This data never leaves your device and isn’t shared with the website. Apple calls these signatures Private Access Tokens (PATs) and already leaves the feature on by default on iPhones running at least iOS 16.  Most captcha providers, like hCaptcha and Cloudflare, now support PATs as well. Cloudflare’s CTO, John Graham-Cumming, said in July that more than half of requests from iOS devices used PATs. Leroy says that Google’s Chrome and Android teams are “working on similar technologies.”  But don’t expect captchas to disappear anytime soon. While Privacy Pass may prove a reliable alternative, captchas remain popular. Ting Wang, an information science and technology professor at Penn State University, predicts they will “continue to exist as a cheap, platform-­agnostic, and universal verification solution.” Shubham Agarwal is a freelance tech journalist.

Inside the quest for unbreakable encryption,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/19/1081389/unbreakable-encryption-quantum-computers-cryptography-math-problems/,2023-10-19,"<p>Cryptographers want encryption schemes that are impossible for tomorrow’s quantum computers to crack. There’s only one catch: they might not exist.</p>
","When we check email, log in to our bank accounts, or exchange messages on Signal, our passwords and credentials are protected through encryption, a locking scheme that uses secrets to disguise our data. It works like a cyber padlock: with the right key someone can unlock the data. Without it, they’ll have to resort to laborious brute-force methods, the digital equivalent of hacksaws and blowtorches. Our trust in online security is rooted in mathematics. Encryption schemes are built on families of math problems called one-way functions—calculations that are easy to carry out in one direction but almost impossible to solve efficiently from the other, even with a powerful computer. They’re sort of a computational equivalent of those road spikes found at the exits of airport car rental agencies. Drive in one direction and you barely notice. Hit reverse and you won’t get far (and will need new tires). There’s a problem, however. Although mathematicians suspect true one-way functions exist, they have yet to prove it. They haven’t proved that the thorny problems we do use are impossible, or even extremely impractical, to solve. Instead, it could just be that we haven’t yet found the appropriate mathematical means to take the problems apart. This conundrum haunts all encryption. Our data is secured by the fact that no one knows how to crack the schemes that protect it—at least not yet.  It’s not just today’s hackers we may need to worry about. Security experts have long warned of a threat that hasn’t yet materialized: quantum computers. In the future these machines could execute a program that quickly solves the math problems behind today’s state-of-the-art encryption. That threat puts personal financial, medical, and other information at risk. Hackers could steal today’s encrypted data and store it away, just waiting for the arrival of new technological lockpicks.  Computer scientists, mathematicians, and cryptographers are on a quest to find new encryption algorithms that can withstand attacks not only from today’s conventional computers but also from tomorrow’s quantum machines. What they want is a big, sticky math problem—something that’s robust enough to withstand attacks from classical and quantum computers but can still be easily implemented in cyberspace.  Unfortunately, no one has yet found a single type of problem that is provably hard for computers—classical or quantum—to solve. (In the world of cryptography, “hard” describes a problem whose solution requires an unreasonable number of steps or amount of computing power.) If one-way functions don’t exist, then cryptographers’ whack-a-mole process of finding flaws and developing ever stronger schemes to block clever hackers will persist indefinitely.  “The question of whether one-way functions exist is really the most important problem,” says Rafael Pass, a theoretical computer scientist at Tel Aviv University in Israel. It’s a conundrum that dates to the 1970s and the dawn of a research area now known as computational complexity theory. Over five decades, theorists and cryptographers have been looking for ways to establish whether such functions do exist. Perhaps the problems we hope or suspect are one-way are just easier, breakable ones in disguise.  Pass is exploring how one-way functions are connected to a raft of other open problems, a promising line of research that has drawn other theorists into the quest. At the same time, people focused on the practical side of cryptography are plowing ahead, hunting for new schemes that are—if not provably hard—seemingly strong enough to hold up against quantum computers.  Computer scientists find themselves at a curious crossroads, unsure of whether post-quantum algorithms are truly unassailable—or just believed to be so. For the last seven years, the job of finding the best candidates has been spearheaded by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the US government body charged with collecting, testing, and standardizing cryptographic algorithms for public use. NIST has been running dozens of potential “post-­quantum” algorithms through a gauntlet of tests and making them available for outside testing. The process has winnowed the field to a few finalists, and in August NIST announced that one called CRYSTALS-Kyber, which takes an approach believed to be robust enough to counter quantum attacks, will be the first to be officially recommended for public use by 2024. After that, companies and governments will adopt the algorithm for encrypting data.  Will it hold up? The answer will help determine the trajectory of cybersecurity in the near term. But it’s far from settled: history suggests that our faith in unbreakability has often been misplaced, and over the years, seemingly impenetrable encryption candidates have fallen to surprisingly simple attacks. Computer scientists find themselves at a curious crossroads, unsure of whether post-quantum algorithms are truly unassailable—or just believed to be so. It’s a distinction at the heart of modern encryption security.  Securing secret messages hasn’t always been tied to difficult math problems; until recently, cryptography was barely mathematical at all. In ancient Greece, military leaders encoded messages using a scytale, a cylindrical device that revealed a hidden message when a strip of seemingly jumbled text was wound around it. Centuries later, Roman historians described a code, often attributed to Julius Caesar, that involved shifting letters in a message three spots up in the alphabet; for example, a d would be written as an a.  Companies are moving away from setting qubit records in favor of practical hardware and long-term goals. In history as in our modern world, secret codes were frequently broken. In the 16th century, during the decades she spent imprisoned by her cousin Queen Elizabeth I, Mary, Queen of Scots, used elaborate, symbol-based ciphers to encode hundreds of letters, most of which were aimed at securing her freedom and regaining the throne. She didn’t prevail: Elizabeth I’s team of spies and codebreakers intercepted, decoded, and copied the letters. In the one that sealed her fate, Mary approved of a plan to assassinate Elizabeth with six words: “sett the six gentlemen to woork.” In response, Elizabeth eventually ordered her cousin beheaded in 1587. In 1932, codebreakers in Poland cracked the code for Germany’s early Enigma machine, invented at the end of World War I. They later shared their intel with British codebreakers, who cracked a more advanced version of Enigma during World War II. Pass, the theoretical computer scientist in Tel Aviv, half-jokingly refers to all time before the 1970s as the “dark age of cryptography.” “Cryptography wasn’t really a scientific field,” he says. “It was more like artist versus attackers. You needed to have [artistic] skills to invent an encryption scheme. And then it would get deployed until some clever person would figure out how to break it. And it was just going on and on like that.”  That changed, Pass says, in November 1976, when cryptographers Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, at Stanford, described a novel way for two people to devise a key that only they knew—one they could then use to pass secret messages. Crucially, they wouldn’t have to meet to do it. This was a groundbreaking notion. Previously, both sender and receiver had to physically possess a key for encoding and decoding. To decrypt a message encoded with the Enigma machine, for example, a recipient needed a key sheet that revealed the initial encryption settings. The secret to the Diffie-Hellman strategy was for two people to build the key using a straightforward mathematical problem that’s easy to compute in one direction and laborious in the other. Here’s how it works: The two people who want to communicate secretly, usually designated Alice and Bob in these setups, each pick a secret number. Then, together, they agree on a pair of numbers that they share publicly (one is a big prime, and the other is called the base). Each of them next carries out a series of mathematical operations to combine those private numbers with the prime and the base.  Then they exchange the results, and they each carry out another series of mathematical operations on the new numbers. In the end, both Alice and Bob will have done the same operations on the same numbers—just not in the same order—and arrived at the same answer. The digits of that answer become the encryption. And an eavesdropper who intercepts the transmission—often nicknamed Eve—won’t be able to easily unravel the mathematical jumble without knowing at least one of the private numbers. She could start testing numbers in a brute-force approach, but that would require an unreasonable amount of calculation.  The complicated problem that Eve would have to solve is called finding a discrete logarithm. The Diffie-Hellman approach is still used today—to secure some VPNs, for example—and is integral to some post-quantum schemes. In their paper, Diffie and Hellman noted that there was no existing algorithm capable of solving the discrete log problem in a reasonable amount of time. There still isn’t. They went on to introduce, for the first time, the notion of one-way functions as a basis for secure cryptography. Today, secure online interactions that involve authentication or digital signatures, for example, are based on that general idea. But without mathematical proof that the problems they rely on are one-way functions, the possibility remains that someone might discover an efficient scheme for cracking them.  Today, online transactions begin with a kind of digital handshake, and the security of that handshake is often guaranteed by another math problem that’s presumed to be difficult. The most popular encryption scheme used today was introduced in 1977 by a trio of young computer scientists who were energized by Diffie and Hellman’s 1976 paper. They called their approach RSA, after the last names of the scientists (Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman).  RSA, which is based on the difficulty of finding prime factors relative to the ease of multiplying them together, is a bit different from the Diffie-Hellman approach. Diffie-Hellman is a shared secret: it allows two users to devise a key over an insecure channel (like the internet), and that key is used to disguise messages. In RSA, Alice uses Bob’s key—based on big prime numbers—to encrypt a message that only he can unlock. RSA can secure data sent from one person to another.   It quickly became one of the most popular public-key encryption methods. It’s easy to use and adapt. Over time, as new algorithms have emerged that can factor faster, and computers have become more powerful, NIST has recommended using larger and larger numbers for security. The numbers are represented in binary form with 1s and 0s, and these binary digits are better known as “bits.” The number 13, for example, is written in binary as 1101, which has four bits. NIST currently recommends using a key represented by at least 2,048 bits—which corresponds to a number with over 600 digits. (To date, the largest number that has been factored into two primes was made up of 250 digits, and the process took nearly 3,000 hours of computing time.) That’s a strength of RSA—even if it’s not uncrackable, it’s been easy to keep upping the ante, making it computationally impractical to break.  In 1994, however, a threat of a different type emerged when the American mathematician Peter Shor, then at Bell Labs, devised an algorithm for quantum computers that could solve the factoring problem in a reasonable amount of time. (It was a double threat: his approach could also conquer the discrete log problem in the Diffie-Hellman approach.)  Shor’s paper ignited excitement and anxiety among those who wanted to build quantum computers and those who recognized the threat it posed to cybersecurity. Fortunately for cryptographers, not just any quantum computer would do.  The last three decades of cybersecurity have played out like an increasingly intricate game, with researchers perpetually building and breaking—or attempting to break—new candidates. A few years back, researchers at Google and the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, in Sweden, estimated that it would take a quantum computer composed of 20 million quantum bits, or qubits, some eight hours to break today’s 2,048-bit RSA security. Current state-of-the-art machines are nowhere close to that size: the largest quantum computer to date, built by IBM, debuted last year with 433 qubits. Whether or not RSA can be considered at immediate risk of a quantum attack depends largely on whom you ask, says computer scientist Ted Shorter, who cofounded the cybersecurity company Keyfactor. He sees a cultural divide between the theorists who study the mathematics of encryption and the cryptographers who work in implementation. To some, the end seems nigh. “You talk to a theoretical computer scientist and they’re like, Yes, RSA is done, because they can imagine it,” Shorter says. For them, he adds, the existence of Shor’s algorithm points to the end of encryption as we know it.  Many cryptographers who are implementing real-world security systems are less concerned about the quantum future than they are about today’s cleverest hackers. After all, people have been trying to factor efficiently for thousands of years, and now the only known method requires a computer that doesn’t exist.  Thomas Decru, a cryptographer at KU Leuven in Belgium, says the quantum threat must be taken seriously, but it’s hard to know if RSA will fall to quantum computers in five years or longer—or never. “As long as quantum computers do not exist, everything you say about them is speculative, in a way,” he says. Pass is more certain about the threat: “It’s safe to say that the existence of this quantum algorithm means there are cracks in the problem, right?”  But we have to be ready for anything, says Lily Chen, a mathematician who manages NIST’s Cryptographic Technology Group and works on the ongoing effort to produce post-quantum encryption standards. Whether they arrive in three years or 30, quantum computers loom on the horizon, and RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and other encryption schemes may be left vulnerable.  Finding a quantum-resistant cryptographic scheme isn’t easy. Without a mathematical problem that is computationally hard, the last three decades of cybersecurity have played out like an increasingly intricate game, with researchers perpetually building and breaking—or attempting to break—new candidates.  This push and pull has already emerged in the NIST post-quantum program. In February 2022, cryptographers found a fatal flaw in Rainbow, an algorithm that had survived three rounds of NIST’s analysis. A few months later, after the NIST list had been winnowed again, Decru and his KU Leuven colleague Wouter Castryck announced that they’d broken another finalist, an algorithm called SIKE.  SIKE, which was developed a few years ago, was the brainchild of a collaboration among researchers and engineers at Amazon, Microsoft, the University of Versailles, and elsewhere. It is based on a special mathematical map, called an isogeny, that is made up of connections between elliptic curves. These maps can be turned into an encryption for communication, and outsiders can’t eavesdrop without knowing the maps. When quantum computers become powerful enough, they could theoretically crack the encryption algorithms that keep us safe. The race is on to find new ones. At Leuven, Decru and Castryck devise ways to use these so-called isogenies to build new, faster encryption approaches. They broke the most difficult version of SIKE in just a few hours of computing time using an ordinary desktop computer. (Since then, other groups have found ways to do it even faster.) What’s more, Decru and Castryck did it almost accidentally, and only a few weeks after SIKE had been declared an alternate NIST finalist. “We weren’t trying to break it at all,” insists Decru. “We just tried to generalize it.”  Chen says the case of SIKE—and Rainbow before it—illustrates a real-world tension that drives efforts to find quantum-proof algorithms. On one hand, she says, “you have to find a problem which is hard for both quantum computers and classical computers.” On the other is implementation: transforming that hard problem into one that can be used in a real-world cryptographic system. Even with today’s well-defined problems, Shorter says, it’s very difficult to predict and prevent every loophole in every operating system and device on the market today. “And then there’s interoperability testing and certifications and other tests,” he says, “to make sure they are not only implemented correctly, but also securely.”   The mathematical problem SIKE is based on seems computationally hard because there are so many different maps that could be constructed between curves. It may even be a one-way problem—and therefore quantum-proof. The flaw was in the design, which revealed too much of the transmitted information. Decru and Castryck cracked it because they inadvertently found a way to expose enough connecting points to give away the entire thing.  Other schemes have fared better. The first post-quantum encryption algorithm to be standardized, CRYSTALS-Kyber, delivers security through an approach that involves problems on lattices, mathematical objectsthat can be modeled as arrays of points. (There are five main families of post-quantum cryptographic methods. Isogeny and lattice approaches are two of them.)  CRYSTALS-Kyber is a general encryption scheme, like RSA, that can be used for tasks like securing online communication. Three other approved algorithms are designed to authenticate digital signatures, ensuring that digital documents haven’t been fraudulently signed. NIST plans to standardize these by spring 2024. Another three (it was four until SIKE was broken) could also be standardized in the next few years, as long as they survive further rounds of scrutiny. But unless mathematicians can prove whether one-way functions exist, says Pass, the patterns that have always characterized cryptography will continue. “We’re back to this cat-and-mouse game, where it’s a game between algorithm designers proposing new candidate constructions and other designers trying to break them,” he says. Unless, of course, he—or someone in his field—can come up with an implementable, provably one-way function to settle the matter of encryption forever.  Until that time, cryptographers will remain in a messy limbo in which convincingly robust encryption schemes can be trusted—but only until they can’t.  The perfect math problem could take us out of this limbo, but it can’t be some sticky mess cooked up by an armchair algebraist over a long weekend. It must strike a balance between math and cryptography, with computational hardness on one side and easy implementation on the other. Stray too far from either of those properties, and it becomes vulnerable—if not now, then in the future. Hanging in the balance is the past, present, and future security of everyone’s data, everywhere. No pressure.  Stephen Ornes is a science writer based in Nashville.

In 1994 , however , a threat of a different type emerged when the American mathematician Peter Shor , then at Bell Labs , devised an algorithm for quantum computers that could solve the factoring problem in a reasonable amount of time . ( It was a double threat : his approach could also conquer the discrete log problem in the Diffie-Hellman approach . ) Shor ’ s paper ignited excitement and anxiety among those who wanted to build quantum computers and those who recognized the threat it posed to cybersecurity . Fortunately for cryptographers , not just any quantum computer would do . The last three decades of cybersecurity have played out like an increasingly intricate game , with researchers perpetually building and breaking—or attempting to break—new candidates . A few years back , researchers at Google and the KTH Royal Institute of Technology , in Sweden , estimated that it would take a quantum computer composed of 20 million quantum bits , or qubits , some eight hours to break today ’ s 2,048-bit RSA security . Current state-of-the-art machines are nowhere close to that size : the largest quantum computer to date , built by IBM , debuted last year with 433 qubits . Whether or not RSA can be considered at immediate risk of a quantum attack depends largely on whom you ask , says computer scientist Ted Shorter , who cofounded the cybersecurity company Keyfactor . He sees a cultural divide between the theorists who study the mathematics of encryption and the cryptographers who work in implementation . To some , the end seems nigh . “ You talk to a theoretical computer scientist and they ’ re like , Yes , RSA is done , because they can imagine it , ” Shorter says . For them , he adds , the existence of Shor ’ s algorithm points to the end of encryption as we know it . Many cryptographers who are implementing real-world security systems are less concerned about the quantum future than they are about today ’ s cleverest hackers . After all , people have been trying to factor efficiently for thousands of years , and now the only known method requires a computer that doesn ’ t exist . Thomas Decru , a cryptographer at KU Leuven in Belgium , says the quantum threat must be taken seriously , but it ’ s hard to know if RSA will fall to quantum computers in five years or longer—or never . “ As long as quantum computers do not exist , everything you say about them is speculative , in a way , ” he says . Pass is more certain about the threat : “ It ’ s safe to say that the existence of this quantum algorithm means there are cracks in the problem , right ? ” But we have to be ready for anything , says Lily Chen , a mathematician who manages NIST ’ s Cryptographic Technology Group and works on the ongoing effort to produce post-quantum encryption standards . Whether they arrive in three years or 30 , quantum computers loom on the horizon , and RSA , Diffie-Hellman , and other encryption schemes may be left vulnerable . Finding a quantum-resistant cryptographic scheme isn ’ t easy . Without a mathematical problem that is computationally hard , the last three decades of cybersecurity have played out like an increasingly intricate game , with researchers perpetually building and breaking—or attempting to break—new candidates . This push and pull has already emerged in the NIST post-quantum program . In February 2022 , cryptographers found a fatal flaw in Rainbow , an algorithm that had survived three rounds of NIST ’ s analysis . A few months later , after the NIST list had been winnowed again , Decru and his KU Leuven colleague Wouter Castryck announced that they ’ d broken another finalist , an algorithm called SIKE . SIKE , which was developed a few years ago , was the brainchild of a collaboration among researchers and engineers at Amazon , Microsoft , the University of Versailles , and elsewhere . It is based on a special mathematical map , called an isogeny , that is made up of connections between elliptic curves . These maps can be turned into an encryption for communication , and outsiders can ’ t eavesdrop without knowing the maps . When quantum computers become powerful enough , they could theoretically crack the encryption algorithms that keep us safe . The race is on to find new ones . At Leuven , Decru and Castryck devise ways to use these so-called isogenies to build new , faster encryption approaches . They broke the most difficult version of SIKE in just a few hours of computing time using an ordinary desktop computer . ( Since then , other groups have found ways to do it even faster . ) What ’ s more , Decru and Castryck did it almost accidentally , and only a few weeks after SIKE had been declared an alternate NIST finalist . “ We weren ’ t trying to break it at all , ” insists Decru . “ We just tried to generalize it. ” Chen says the case of SIKE—and Rainbow before it—illustrates a real-world tension that drives efforts to find quantum-proof algorithms . On one hand , she says , “ you have to find a problem which is hard for both quantum computers and classical computers. ” On the other is implementation : transforming that hard problem into one that can be used in a real-world cryptographic system . Even with today ’ s well-defined problems , Shorter says , it ’ s very difficult to predict and prevent every loophole in every operating system and device on the market today . “ And then there ’ s interoperability testing and certifications and other tests , ” he says , “ to make sure they are not only implemented correctly , but also securely. ” The mathematical problem SIKE is based on seems computationally hard because there are so many different maps that could be constructed between curves . It may even be a one-way problem—and therefore quantum-proof . The flaw was in the design , which revealed too much of the transmitted information . Decru and Castryck cracked it because they inadvertently found a way to expose enough connecting points to give away the entire thing . Other schemes have fared better . The first post-quantum encryption algorithm to be standardized , CRYSTALS-Kyber , delivers security through an approach that involves problems on lattices , mathematical objectsthat can be modeled as arrays of points . ( There are five main families of post-quantum cryptographic methods . Isogeny and lattice approaches are two of them . ) CRYSTALS-Kyber is a general encryption scheme , like RSA , that can be used for tasks like securing online communication . Three other approved algorithms are designed to authenticate digital signatures , ensuring that digital documents haven ’ t been fraudulently signed . NIST plans to standardize these by spring 2024 . Another three ( it was four until SIKE was broken ) could also be standardized in the next few years , as long as they survive further rounds of scrutiny . But unless mathematicians can prove whether one-way functions exist , says Pass , the patterns that have always characterized cryptography will continue . “ We ’ re back to this cat-and-mouse game , where it ’ s a game between algorithm designers proposing new candidate constructions and other designers trying to break them , ” he says . Unless , of course , he—or someone in his field—can come up with an implementable , provably one-way function to settle the matter of encryption forever . Until that time , cryptographers will remain in a messy limbo in which convincingly robust encryption schemes can be trusted—but only until they can ’ t . The perfect math problem could take us out of this limbo , but it can ’ t be some sticky mess cooked up by an armchair algebraist over a long weekend . It must strike a balance between math and cryptography , with computational hardness on one side and easy implementation on the other . Stray too far from either of those properties , and it becomes vulnerable—if not now , then in the future . Hanging in the balance is the past , present , and future security of everyone ’ s data , everywhere . No pressure .

According to Sandeep Davé, chief digital and technology officer at global firm CBRE, the commercial real estate industry is no stranger to these changes and challenges. Delivering the best outcomes and optimizing operations means forging clear digital strategies for business transformation that are focused on the root of client and business problems. “Through our ethos, we don't chase the shiny object, whether it's AI or any other technology,” says Davé. “We aren't saying, well, what can I do for the purposes of doing AI, but what is the business problem that I'm trying to solve?” While developing a foundational strategy for transformation that is based on enabling the core business is key, advanced technologies like AI and machine learning are powerful tools that can unlock efficiencies across the entire real estate lifecycle, Davé says. AI/ML are incredibly powerful tools to become data-driven from analytics tools that can predict asset failures and market movements to infusing efficiencies across operations. “There are new and different ways in which real estate is viewed, transacted, managed, and all of that gets enabled through data and technology,” says Davé. Beyond operational improvements, advanced and smart technologies can also help reduce emissions. According to a 2019 International Energy Agency global status report, the real estate industry contributed 39% of global carbon emissions attributed to both construction and the life cycle of the asset. As a result, sustainability initiatives have become a priority for a firm of the scale of CBRE, says Davé. “At the time of managing the building, there are many solutions that offer instant gratification, stick sensors up, light up a building, and they all work well if all you need to do is to light up a building. But in order to meet the scale and the global net-zero targets that our clients have set, our solutions need to be at portfolio scale and need to be multidimensional.” Becoming data-driven remains imperative for any organization looking to keep up with the varied and changing needs of clients adapting to changes in the market and technology landscape. “The industry finds itself in the midst of two of the most dominant trends of our time, from return to work to sustainability,” says Davé. “We've seen a step change in technology in terms of what cloud and AI gives us, and all of that, I think, is going to also drive tremendous change. And we'll continue to push the bounds of technology in the service of our clients’ real-world challenges.” This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Infosys Cobalt. Laurel Ruma: From MIT Technology Review, I'm Laurel Ruma and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.Our topic is digital transformation and how clear strategy and emerging technologies such as cloud computing and AI can help transform industries including commercial real estate and propel adoption of sustainability goals.Two words for you: inspiring transformation.My guest today is Sandeep Davé, the chief digital and technology officer at CBRE.This podcast is produced in partnership with Infosys Cobalt.Welcome, Sandeep. Sandeep Davé: Thank you. Thank you for having me on the show. Laurel: Could you talk a bit more about your role at CBRE and what it means to specialize in digital strategy and business transformation at the world's largest commercial real estate company? Sandeep: Sure. And for your audience, maybe perhaps I can give a little bit of a context around CBRE and what we do. So as you said, CBRE is the world's largest commercial real estate services, brokerage, and investment firm. And essentially in that capacity, we help our clients across the entire lifecycle of real estate from investing in an asset to leasing space, to designing it, to building it out, and managing it on an ongoing basis. We are a global company, Fortune 130, operating in over 100-plus countries. We process over 450 billion in transaction volume. We've managed over 7 billion square feet, so it's a sprawling operation. And in my role as chief digital and technology officer, I oversee all aspects of technology for the company, from digital strategy, tech enablement for each one of our business lines, our venture investments and partnerships, and our traditional technology infrastructure as well. Now, with respect to your question around what does it mean to drive digital strategy or business transformation in commercial real estate. Like every industry, technology is impacting commercial real estate. It's a moment of tremendous change. Real estate decisions are getting microsegmented. There are new and different ways in which real estate is viewed, transacted, managed, and all of that gets enabled through data and technology. And I work with the leaders in the company to navigate these changes. Laurel: So what does technological transformation then look like for a global firm like CBRE? Sandeep: Sure. CBRE is a 100-plus year old company and in an industry that was traditionally slow to adopt new technologies. And so we took the transformation in two parts. And in fact, even before I discuss those two parts, I'd like to just step back and set some context. I've spent time in many industries, commercial real estate, financial services, and I have seen two models of digital transformation emerge. There's no model that's right or wrong. But in one model, a company goes out there and declares themselves to be a technology company and the decisions that they take are aligned with them becoming a technology company. They set up software P&Ls, they set up their own venture investment capabilities, and the pursuit is towards those goals. Whereas we are very clear about who we are, which is that we are the largest and best commercial real estate services company, investment brokerage company in the world. But we also realize that data, insights, technology is going to be critical to deliver the best outcomes for our clients. So in that context, our transformation is based on enabling the core business. So for that purpose, we had to do two things. The first was to build a foundation. First few years we were focused on building a global talent pool that I'm very proud of. We've migrated 100% to the cloud, agile, and over the years we've built an enterprise data platform that is meaningful to our transformation. With that foundation in place, we focused on the second part of our transformation, which is to have a clear digital strategy for each line of businesses and therefore focusing on the most pressing problems for our clients. Finally, given the breadth and scale of our operations, we sit on tremendous amounts of data and we've made meaningful strides in creating a data advantage for the company. Laurel: Enterprises are always looking for an advantage, especially with data. Could you outline what that does mean for CBRE, like opportunities and benefits working with all of this data? Sandeep: Sure. Very interesting space and I spent a lot of time in consumer financial services in other consumer industries, and the one difference that was stark to me as I started working in commercial real estate is that this industry was not facing a big data problem, at least not then when each of the buildings were not centralized, but it was more of a siloed data problem. So by no means am I trivializing the data challenges that I faced in financial services. There were many, but the one thing that I had a benefit of was transaction after transaction of structured data that allowed me to slice and dice and understand my customer's behaviors. Whereas, what happens in the commercial real estate industry is that data is very siloed, but yet anchored around a property. And even the definition of the property is different depending on who you ask. Whether you are assessing or valuing the entire building versus I'm trying to lease one floor in that building, what I call property changes. So what we had to do first and foremost was to break down those barriers and we created an enterprise data platform that, against a standard taxonomy, ingests data from 300-plus different data sources and now manages billions of data points. Having sat on that foundation, we now have the ability to generate tremendous insights for our clients. So we are able to, our 350-plus clients, provide them a range of insights at a portfolio scale to a single building level, operational insights, financial insights, occupancy, energy, health and safety risks, so on and so forth. And that same foundation now allows us to unlock efficiencies at a larger scale and apply ML models to generate deeper insights and drive greater transformation. Laurel: So from the automotive industry to healthcare to corporate banking, AI has emerged as a powerful tool across supply chains and industries, and it's changing how enterprises operate and what services they can offer to clients. So in real estate and asset management, what does AI look like and what decisions, especially in the C-suite, are made using this technology to drive better business outcomes? Sandeep: Your question is spot on, which is that how do we use the technology to drive data business outcomes? And through our ethos, we don't chase the shiny object, whether it's AI or any other technology. We aren't saying, well, what can I do for the purposes of doing AI, but what is the business problem that I'm trying to solve? And we have actually been focused on AI/ML, even before the public awareness soared post the release of ChatGPT. But we look at this in the spectrum of unlocking efficiencies to enable differentiation and across the entire lifecycle of real estate, there is a play in both of those–unlocking efficiencies and enabling differentiation. The way the decisions around how property investments are made, how market movements are tracked, are very data-driven now. The decisions around how space is managed is very data-driven now.   Laurel: So could you give an example of how AI and cloud computing could be used to build smart buildings, structures, and technology capabilities? Sandeep: Sure. Using an example is great because this is such a wide field, both commercial real estate and the application of AI/ML in commercial real estate. In the area of smart buildings, we are focused on enabling three outcomes for our clients: energy, efficiency, and experience; which is how do they manage their energy usage, how do they get more efficient in everything that they do with respect to managing a property? And then what is the workplace experience for the employees in a building? And let me just take an example of efficiency. There was a certain way in which buildings were managed previously. And with the application of cloud native global technology solutions, that we have that are infused with AI/ML, we are now able to manage facilities in a smarter manner, what we call Smart FM. We are able to look at occupancy and dynamically clean the environment rather than having people cleaning the environment on a regular schedule, we are able to save our clients a lot of money with respect to dynamic cleaning. We are able to detect anomalies in how we manage buildings and assets, which can then further reduce the false alarms and the number of truck rolls that need to happen with respect to managing a building. So there are so many different ways in which we infuse AI/ML. Laurel: That's really interesting. So according to a 2019 International Energy Agency global status report, the real estate industry contributed 39% of global carbon emissions. Could you offer us an example of how smart technologies, like what you're talking about now, could boost operational efficiencies and then also help reduce emissions and improve sustainability? Sandeep: Yeah, absolutely. I think there are two ways in which we look at this space. As you indicated that 39% of carbon emissions are contributed by real estate, and so therefore the industry has a huge role to play. Part of those emissions are at the time of construction itself, and the remainder is for the life cycle of the asset. Right at the time of construction, we've built capabilities where we are able to design and redesign based on a certain energy emission target for a building. We are able to select our suppliers based on a certain energy emission target for the building. And then at the time of managing the building, there are many solutions that offer instant gratification, stick sensors up, light up a building, and they all work well if all you need to do is to light up a building. But in order to meet the scale and the global net-zero targets that our clients have set, our solutions need to be at portfolio scale and need to be multidimensional. And so therefore what we do is we have the ability to ingest data from various different sources, from sensors, and are able to harmonize that and land it against a standard taxonomy. And then we are able to assess that in many different ways. We are able to bring together different aspects of looking at energy and looking at occupancy and managing the building based on the occupancy in the building. Those interventions, for example, at one of our clients recently, meant we were able to stand up those interventions at 25-plus buildings. And that led to a reduction in peak usage energy for them and also reduction in reactive maintenance work orders, reducing truck rolls, and supporting their energy goals. Laurel: So you also are talking about this on a portfolio level. And CBRE's own corporate responsibility and environmental social and governance or ESG goals are as follows: scale to a low-carbon future, create opportunities for employees to thrive through diversity, equity, inclusion initiatives and to build trust through integrity. How is CBRE using emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning to then become more efficient and also meet those ESG goals? Sandeep: I think a lot of the ESG problem is a data problem. Today, if you talk to most who are trying and most are grappling with this problem right now, what they'll say is that do they have a clear line of sight of what their, for example, scope 1 and scope 2, scope 3 emissions are? Are they able to capture the data in a reliable manner, audit it in a reliable manner, and then report against it? While they report against it, can they also manage usage? Because if you are able to look at the data, then you will know where corrective actions are required. Building on the foundation of the data platform that we've built on, which is 100% cloud native, by the way, we can then, on top of that, apply these technologies where we can apply ML models to detect anomalies. We take a digital twins perspective to map our data against the buildings and manage the end-to-end lifecycle of that real estate process. Laurel: So looking into the future Sandeep, which I know is difficult, but how do you anticipate the commercial real estate industry transforming in the next five years as emerging technologies, hybrid ways of working, and calls for greater sustainability initiatives become more prevalent? Sandeep: There's always a risk of predictions to a five-year out prediction at a time when the pace of change is dizzying. However, since you've asked, maybe I'll share three points. The first is, let's take an example of financial services. The first is related to just insights. If you take the wealth management industry, information used to be an advantage. Now information is a commodity. Insights are an advantage. Insights that were an advantage yesterday are less of an advantage today, but the wealth manager's job is more important than ever. They're now closer to the client than ever before and they're giving more meaningful advice than ever before. We are seeing very similar changes in commercial real estate today, whether that's investment or leasing decisions, which are getting microsegmented and extremely data-driven. What matters to one client is not going to matter to another client. One client may be most focused on energy goals for their investments. The other client may be focused on labor analytics or gentrification metrics. So how we see the industry moving towards those microsegmented decisions that are data-driven. So that's one area of transformation that I see in the industry and how deeper data insights are going to be really relevant in terms of enabling that. Second, if we take any outsourcing industry, which is also part of what we do, whether that's in BPO [business process outsourcing] or technology outsourcing, they all started with augmentation. You need 10 people. I'm going to give you 10 people. But overtime labor arbitrage moves. You run out of steam quickly and you move to delivering outcomes. And once you have to deliver outcomes, then the model has to be that “I have the best processes, I have the best technology, I have the best data and the best insights, and therefore I am confidently telling you that I'm in a better position to deliver better outcomes for you.” But at the same time, deliver better margins for the company. That's exactly what we are doing in our outsourcing business, and that's a transformation that I see happening in the industry to move away from staff org, if you will, to outcomes based. And third, I think it's a pivotal moment from many different ways. The industry finds itself in the midst of two of the most dominant trends of our time from return to work to sustainability. We've seen a step change in technology in terms of what cloud and AI gives us and all of that I think is going to also drive tremendous change and we'll continue to push the bounds of technology in the service of our clients’ real-world challenges. Laurel: That is certainly comprehensive. Sandeep, thank you so much for joining us today on the Business Lab. Sandeep: Thank you. Thank you for having me.

According to Sandeep Davé , chief digital and technology officer at global firm CBRE , the commercial real estate industry is no stranger to these changes and challenges . Delivering the best outcomes and optimizing operations means forging clear digital strategies for business transformation that are focused on the root of client and business problems . “ Through our ethos , we do n't chase the shiny object , whether it 's AI or any other technology , ” says Davé . “ We are n't saying , well , what can I do for the purposes of doing AI , but what is the business problem that I 'm trying to solve ? ” While developing a foundational strategy for transformation that is based on enabling the core business is key , advanced technologies like AI and machine learning are powerful tools that can unlock efficiencies across the entire real estate lifecycle , Davé says . AI/ML are incredibly powerful tools to become data-driven from analytics tools that can predict asset failures and market movements to infusing efficiencies across operations . “ There are new and different ways in which real estate is viewed , transacted , managed , and all of that gets enabled through data and technology , ” says Davé . Beyond operational improvements , advanced and smart technologies can also help reduce emissions . According to a 2019 International Energy Agency global status report , the real estate industry contributed 39 % of global carbon emissions attributed to both construction and the life cycle of the asset . As a result , sustainability initiatives have become a priority for a firm of the scale of CBRE , says Davé . “ At the time of managing the building , there are many solutions that offer instant gratification , stick sensors up , light up a building , and they all work well if all you need to do is to light up a building . But in order to meet the scale and the global net-zero targets that our clients have set , our solutions need to be at portfolio scale and need to be multidimensional. ” Becoming data-driven remains imperative for any organization looking to keep up with the varied and changing needs of clients adapting to changes in the market and technology landscape . “ The industry finds itself in the midst of two of the most dominant trends of our time , from return to work to sustainability , ” says Davé . “ We 've seen a step change in technology in terms of what cloud and AI gives us , and all of that , I think , is going to also drive tremendous change . And we 'll continue to push the bounds of technology in the service of our clients ’ real-world challenges. ” This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Infosys Cobalt . Laurel Ruma : From MIT Technology Review , I 'm Laurel Ruma and this is Business Lab , the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.Our topic is digital transformation and how clear strategy and emerging technologies such as cloud computing and AI can help transform industries including commercial real estate and propel adoption of sustainability goals.Two words for you : inspiring transformation.My guest today is Sandeep Davé , the chief digital and technology officer at CBRE.This podcast is produced in partnership with Infosys Cobalt.Welcome , Sandeep . Sandeep Davé : Thank you . Thank you for having me on the show . Laurel : Could you talk a bit more about your role at CBRE and what it means to specialize in digital strategy and business transformation at the world 's largest commercial real estate company ? Sandeep : Sure . And for your audience , maybe perhaps I can give a little bit of a context around CBRE and what we do . So as you said , CBRE is the world 's largest commercial real estate services , brokerage , and investment firm . And essentially in that capacity , we help our clients across the entire lifecycle of real estate from investing in an asset to leasing space , to designing it , to building it out , and managing it on an ongoing basis . We are a global company , Fortune 130 , operating in over 100-plus countries . We process over 450 billion in transaction volume . We 've managed over 7 billion square feet , so it 's a sprawling operation . And in my role as chief digital and technology officer , I oversee all aspects of technology for the company , from digital strategy , tech enablement for each one of our business lines , our venture investments and partnerships , and our traditional technology infrastructure as well . Now , with respect to your question around what does it mean to drive digital strategy or business transformation in commercial real estate . Like every industry , technology is impacting commercial real estate . It 's a moment of tremendous change . Real estate decisions are getting microsegmented . There are new and different ways in which real estate is viewed , transacted , managed , and all of that gets enabled through data and technology .
