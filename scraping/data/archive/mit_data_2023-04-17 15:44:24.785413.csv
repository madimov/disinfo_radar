Banning ChatGPT will do more harm than good,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/14/1071194/chatgpt-ai-high-school-education-first-person/,2023-04-14,"<p>A high school senior argues that ChatGPT can help reshape education for the better.</p>
","The narrative around cheating students doesn’t tell the whole story. Meet the teachers who think generative AI could actually make learning better. The release of ChatGPT has sent shock waves through the halls of higher education. Universities have rushed to release guidelines on how it can be used in the classroom. Professors have taken to social media to share a spectrum of AI policies. And students—whether or not they’ll admit it—have cautiously experimented with the idea of allowing it to play a part in their academic work.  But the notion of a measured response to the emergence of this powerful chatbot seems to have barely penetrated the world of K–12 education. Instead of transparent, well-defined expectations, high schoolers across the country have been confronted with a silent coup of blocked AI websites.1  That’s a shame. If educators actively engage with students about the technology’s capabilities and limitations—and work with them to define new academic standards—ChatGPT, and generative AI more broadly, could both democratize and revitalize K–12 education on an unprecedented scale.  A bold claim, I know. But after a few months of putting generative AI to the test (a nerdy case of senioritis, if you will), I’m optimistic. Exhibit A? College applications.  Few things are as mentally draining as applying to college these days, and as I slaved away at my supplemental essays, the promise of using ChatGPT as a real-time editor was attractive—partly as a potential productivity boost, but mostly as a distraction.  I had ChatGPT carefully review my cloying use of semicolons, grade my writing on a 0–10 scale (the results were erratic and maddening)2, and even role-play as an admissions counselor. Its advice was fundamentally incompatible with the creative demands of the modern college essay, and I mostly ignored it. But the very act of discussing my writing “out loud,” albeit with a machine, helped me figure out what I wanted to say next. Using ChatGPT to verbalize the space of possibilities—from the scale of words to paragraphs—strengthened my own thinking. And I’ve experienced something similar across every domain I’ve applied it to, from generating fifth-grader-level explanations of the French pluperfect to deciphering the Latin names of human muscles. All this adds up to a simple but profound fact: anyone with an internet connection now has a personal tutor, without the costs associated with private tutoring. Sure, an easily hoodwinked, slightly delusional tutor, but a tutor nonetheless. The impact of this is hard to overstate, and it is as relevant in large public school classrooms where students struggle to receive individual attention as it is in underserved and impoverished communities without sufficient educational infrastructure. As the psychologist Benjamin Bloom demonstrated in the early 1980s, one-on-one instruction until mastery allowed almost all students to outperform the class average by two standard deviations (“about 90% … attained the level … reached by only the highest 20%”).   ChatGPT certainly can’t replicate human interaction, but even its staunchest critics have to admit it’s a step in the right direction on this front. Maybe only 1% of students will use it in this way, and maybe it’s only half as effective as a human tutor, but even with these lowball numbers, its potential for democratizing educational access is enormous. I would even go so far as to say that if ChatGPT had existed during the pandemic, many fewer students would have fallen behind.  Of course, those decrying ChatGPT as the end of critical thinking would likely protest that the bot will only exacerbate the lazy academic habits students might have formed over the course of the pandemic. I have enough experience with the tips and tricks we high schoolers employ on a regular basis to know that this is a valid concern—one that shouldn’t be brushed off by casting ChatGPT as just the latest in a long line of technological revolutions in the classroom, from the calculator to the internet. That said, ChatGPT has just as much potential in the classroom as it does for improving individual educational outcomes. English teachers could use it to rephrase the notoriously confusing answer keys to AP test questions, to help students prepare more effectively. They could provide each student with an essay antithetical to the one they turned in, and have them pick apart these contrary arguments in a future draft. No human teacher could spend the time or energy needed to explain pages upon pages of lengthy reading comprehension questions or compose hundreds of five-page essays, but a chatbot can.  Educators can even lean into ChatGPT’s tendency to falsify, misattribute, and straight-out lie as a way of teaching students about disinformation. Imagine using ChatGPT to pen essays that conceal subtle logical fallacies or propose scientific explanations that are almost, but not quite, correct. Learning to discriminate between these convincing mistakes and the correct answer is the very pinnacle of critical thinking, and this new breed of academic assignment will prepare students for a world fraught with everything from politically correct censorship to deepfakes.  There are certainly less optimistic visions for the future. But the only way we avoid them—the only way this technology gets normalized and regulated alongside its similarly disruptive forebears—is with more discussion, more guidance, and more understanding. And it’s not as if there’s no time to catch up. ChatGPT won’t be acing AP English classes anytime soon, and with the recent release of GPT-4, we are already seeing an explosion of ed-tech companies that reduce the effort and expertise needed for teachers and students to operate the bot.  So here’s my pitch to those in power. Regardless of the specific policy you choose to employ at your school, unblock and unban. The path forward starts by trusting students to experiment with the tool, and guiding them through how, when, and where it can be used. You don’t need to restructure your whole curriculum around it, but blocking it will only send it underground. That will lead to confusion and misinterpretation in the best of cases, and misuse and abuse in the worst.  ChatGPT is the only beginning. There are simply too many generative AI tools to try to block them all, and doing so sends the wrong message. What we need is a direct discourse between students, teachers, and administrators. I’m lucky enough to be at a school that has taken the first steps in this direction, and it’s my hope that many more will follow suit.

","This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here. This year millions of people have tried—and been wowed by— artificial-intelligence systems. That’s in no small part thanks to OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT.  When it launched last November, the chatbot became an instant hit among students, many of whom embraced it as a tool to write essays and finish homework. Some media outlets went as far as to declare that the college essay is dead.  Alarmed by an influx of AI-generated essays, schools around the world moved swiftly to ban the use of the technology.  But nearly half a year later, the outlook is a lot less bleak. For MIT Technology Review’s upcoming print issue on education, my colleague Will Douglas Heaven spoke to a number of educators who are now reevaluating what chatbots like ChatGPT mean for how we teach our kids. Many teachers now believe that far from being just a dream machine for cheaters, ChatGPT could actually help make education better. Read his story here.  What’s clear from Will’s story is that ChatGPT will change the way schools teach. But the biggest educational outcome from the technology might not be a new way of writing essays or homework. It’s AI literacy.  AI is becoming an increasingly integral part of our lives, and tech companies are rolling out AI-powered products at a breathtakingly fast pace. AI language models could become powerful productivity tools that we use every single day.  I’ve written a lot about the dangers associated with artificial intelligence, from biased avatar generators to the impossible task of detecting AI-generated text.  Every time I ask experts about what ordinary people can do to protect themselves from these types of harm, the answer is the same. They say there is an urgent need for the public to be better informed about how AI works and what its limitations are, in order to prevent ourselves from being fooled or harmed by a computer program. Until now, the uptake of AI literacy schemes has been sluggish. But ChatGPT has forced many schools to quickly adapt and start teaching kids an ad hoc curriculum of AI 101.  The teachers Will spoke to had already started applying a critical lens to technologies such as ChatGPT. Emily Donahoe, a writing tutor and educational developer at the University of Mississippi, said she thinks that ChatGPT could help teachers shift away from an excessive focus on final results. Getting a class to engage with AI and think critically about what it generates could make teaching feel more human, she says, “rather than asking students to write and perform like robots.” And because the AI model has been trained with North American data and reflects North American biases, teachers are finding that it is a great way to start a conversation about bias.  David Smith, a professor of bioscience education at Sheffield Hallam University in the UK, allows his undergraduate students to use ChatGPT in their written assignments, but he will assess the prompt as well as—or even rather than—the essay itself. “Knowing the words to use in a prompt and then understanding the output that comes back is important,” he says. “We need to teach how to do that.”  One of the biggest flaws of AI language models is that they make stuff up and confidently present falsehoods as facts. This makes them unsuitable for tasks where accuracy is extremely important, such as scientific research and health care. But Helen Crompton, an associate professor of instructional technology at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, has found the AI’s model’s “hallucinations” a useful teaching tool too.  “The fact that it’s not perfect is great,” Crompton says. It’s an opportunity for productive discussions about misinformation and bias.  These kinds of examples give me hope that education systems and policymakers will realize just how important it is to teach the next generation critical thinking skills around AI.  For adults, one promising AI literacy initiative is a free online course called Elements of AI, which is developed by startup MinnaLearn and the University of Helsinki. It was launched in 2018 and is now available in 28 languages. Elements of AI teaches people what AI is and, most important, what it can and can’t do. I’ve tried it myself, and it’s a great resource. My bigger concern is whether we will be able to get adults up to speed quickly enough. Without AI literacy among the internet-surfing adult population, more and more people are bound to fall prey to unrealistic expectations and hype. Meanwhile, AI chatbots could be weaponized as powerful phishing, scamming, and misinformation tools.  The kids will be alright. It’s the adults we need to worry about.   The complex math of counterfactuals could help Spotify pick your next favorite song A new kind of machine-learning model built by a team of researchers at the music-streaming firm Spotify captures, for the first time, the complex math behind counterfactual analysis, a precise technique that can be used to identify the causes of past events and predict the effects of future ones. By tweaking the right things, it’s possible to separate true causation from correlation and coincidence. What’s the big deal: The model could improve the accuracy of automated decision-making, especially personalized recommendations, in a range of applications from finance to health care.

Teachers in Denmark are using apps to audit their students’ moods,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/17/1071137/denmark-teachers-apps-student-mood-audit-software/,2023-04-17,"<p>Companies say the software can help improve well-being, but some experts worry it could have the opposite effect.</p>
","In a Copenhagen suburb, a fifth-grade classroom is having its weekly cake-eating session, a common tradition in Danish public schools. While the children are eating chocolate cake, the teacher pulls up an infographic on a whiteboard: a bar chart generated by a digital platform that collects data on how they’ve been feeling. Organized to display the classroom’s weekly “mood landscape,” the data shows that the class averaged a mood of 4.4 out of 5, and the children rated their family life highly. “That’s great!” the teacher exclaims, raising two thumbs up in the air.  She then moves to an infographic on sleep hygiene. Here the data shows the students struggling, and the teacher invites them to think of ways to improve their sleeping habits. After briefly talking among themselves, the children suggest “less screen time at night,” “meditation before sleep,” and “having a hot bath.” They collectively make a commitment to implement these strategies. At next week’s cake time, they will be asked whether or not they followed through.  These sorts of data-driven well-­being audits are becoming more and more common in Denmark’s classrooms. The country has long been a leader in online services and infrastructure, ranking as the most digitally developed nation in the UN’s e-government survey. In recent years its schools, too, have received big investments in this type of technology: it is estimated that the Danish government allocated $4 to $8 million, a fourth of the high school budget for teaching aids, to procuring digital platforms in 2018. In 2021, it invested some $7 million more.   These investments are rooted in a Nordic tradition of education that centers the child’s experience and encourages interactive learning; some Scandinavian education researchers think technology can help draw children in as playful, active participants. “Technology is an extended pencil and drawing pad. It’s a tool that is bound to the child’s opportunity to express themselves,” Mari-Ann Letnes, an education scientist in Norway, said in a 2018 interview. In a 2019 status report on the use of technology in schools, the Danish Ministry of Education stated that “creativity and self-expression with digital technologies are a part of building students’ motivation and versatile development.” Now, some teachers and administrators are hoping technology can be used to tackle mental health as well. Danish schoolchildren are in the midst of a mental-health crisis that one of the country’s biggest political parties has called a challenge “equal to inflation, the environmental crisis, and national security.” No one knows why, but in just a few decades, the number of Danish children and youth with depression has more than sextupled. One-quarter of ninth graders report that they have attempted self-harm. (The problem isn’t exclusive to Denmark: depressive episodes among US teens increased by some 60% between 2007 and 2017, and teen suicide rates have also leaped by around 60% over the same period.) A recent open letter signed by more than 1,000 Danish school psychologists expressed “serious concerns” over the mental state of the children they see in their work and warned that if action isn’t taken immediately, they “see no hope for turning the negative trend around.”  To help address the problem, some Danish schools are moving to address children’s well-being through platforms like Woof, the one used in the fifth-grade classroom. Built by a Denmark-based startup, it frequently surveys schoolchildren on a variety of well-being indicators and uses an algorithm to suggest particular issues for the class to focus on.  Going to sleep in virtual reality can alleviate insomnia and loneliness—if you can avoid being harassed by kids. These platforms are quickly gaining ground. Woof, for example, has been implemented in classrooms in more than 600 schools across Denmark, with more on the way. Its founders believe Woof fills an important niche: they say teachers have expressed widespread dissatisfaction with existing tools, in particular a government-run well-being survey. That survey audits schools once a year and delivers results on a delay; it might provide a snapshot for policymakers but is hardly useful for teachers, who need regular feedback to adjust their work. “There is simply a need for tools to check in [with the children] where you don’t need to be active,” says Mathias Probst, a cofounder of Woof. “Where you don’t need to talk to all 24 children before starting a class, because before you know it, 15 minutes of class time has already passed.” And teachers could benefit, he suggests, from “something that can bring a data structure into all of this.”  Woof is not alone in its attempt to quantify children’s moods. A handful of other platforms have been adopted by Danish schools, and schools in Finland and the UK are using mood-monitoring software as well. In the US, the tech can extend beyond collecting self-reports to hunting for hints of concerning behavior by surveilling students’ emails, chat messages, and searches on school-issued devices.  A number of people say mood-­monitoring tech has great potential. “We can use digital tools to evaluate well-­being on a 24-hour basis. How is the sleep? How is the physical activity, how is the interaction with others? ... How does [the child’s] screen time compare to physical time? That’s central to understanding what well-being actually is,” the late Carsten Obel, who was a professor of public health at Aarhus University and a leader in the development of another student-surveying tool called Moods, said in a 2019 video.  But some experts are heavily skeptical of the approach. They say there is little evidence that quantification of this sort can be used to solve social problems, and that fostering a habit of self-surveillance from an early age could fundamentally alter children’s relationship to themselves and each other in a way that makes them feel worse rather than better. “We can hardly go to a restaurant or to the theater without being asked how we feel about it afterwards and ticking boxes here and there,” says Karen Vallgårda, an associate professor at the University of Copenhagen who studies family and childhood history. “There is a quantification of emotions and experiences that is growing, and it’s important that we ask ourselves whether that’s the ideal approach when it comes to children’s well-being.” Others are asking how much children and their parents actually know about what data is being collected—and how it is being used. While some platforms say they are collecting minimal or no personally identifiable data, others mine deep into individual children’s mental states, physical activity, and even friend groups.  “Their practice is very Silicon Valley–like. They preach data transparency but have none themselves,” says Jesper Balslev, a research consultant at the Copenhagen School of Design and Technology, of some of these platforms. Balslev says he is concerned that Woof and other platforms are being swiftly and naively rolled out without adequate regulation, testing, or efforts to make sure that the school culture allows children to abstain from participating in them. “Our regulatory technologies to deal with this are terrible,” he says. It’s possible that will change, he adds, “but right now, all the hobs are turned on at the same time.”  Woof is run from a basement office on the outskirts of Copenhagen, with a small team of three full-time staffers. The founders, Mathias Probst and Amalie Danckert, got the idea for the company after working as public school teachers through Teach First Denmark, an organization similar to Teach for America in the United States.  When Probst and Danckert entered the public school system, they say, they quickly realized that schools in low-income neighborhoods face a vicious cycle. Difficult circumstances at home can make students in these schools more challenging to teach. Staff turnover rates are high because of stress and burnout, with some teachers keen to switch to “easier” schools. Parents with resources often take their children elsewhere, so kids with more problems make up an even greater proportion of those who remain, exacerbating the stress teachers face and the likelihood that they’ll leave. All this compounds the well-being crisis that children are experiencing elsewhere.  “I saw so many children ending up in difficult situations, which could have been prevented if action had been taken earlier,” says Danckert, who before her stint as a teacher worked as an analyst in the children and youth section of Copenhagen’s Social Services Administration. Danckert and Probst, who has a background in consulting, set out to build a way to help schools manage such situations before they spiral into serious mental-health problems—problems that schools’ thinly stretched counseling systems may not catch until it’s too late. Woof, the solution they devised, is a web app that children can access on computers or phones (a 2019 study found that 98% of Danish children between 10 and 15 have access to a smartphone). Its user interface primarily features a cartoon dog, which asks the children various questions about their life. The tool is designed to be used on a weekly basis, generating a “mood landscape” for the class by prompting kids to rate their mood and other aspects of their lives on a 1–5 scale. The result is supposed to add up to a comprehensive image of child welfare in that classroom over time.  Teachers and administrative staff can read weekly reports on a class’s overall self-reported mood and how factors like  their sleep hygiene, social activity, academic performance, and physical activity affect that mood. Classrooms are profiled, and interventions are recommended to improve the scores in categories where they are doing less well. Finally, the teacher and the children look at the data together and help each other with tools and strategies to improve these sticking points.  “It’s worrying that there is so much personally attributable data on platforms working with children.” Woof’s data is anonymized; the app reports on classroom averages instead of individual children. Danckert says that’s because the company was unwilling to walk right up to the edge of what was legally and ethically feasible under data privacy laws. Probst also describes feeling uneasy that collecting data on individual children might create a narrative and lock them into it, rather than helping them break negative patterns. “It’s worrying that there is so much personally attributable data on platforms working with children,” he says. The startup fully launched Woof less than a year ago, in the fall of 2022. According to beta test data collected on 30 schools before its full launch, 80% of classes that use Woof see mood improve by, on average, 0.35 points on the 1–5 scale within one month. Woof maintains that the platform isn’t meant to replace teacher-student contact. It should rather be understood as a support tool for teachers that provides structured action plans and feedback.  But some experts have doubts about whether Woof’s methods are effective. They are particularly skeptical about the self-reported nature of the platform’s data.  According to Balslev, education apps have not proved that they perform any better than analog interventions, such as having teachers advise children to turn off their computers and ask them how they slept last night. He points to historical lessons, such as a 2015 OECD study finding that digitalization in schools in a variety of countries had exacerbated a range of problems it was supposed to improve, with a net negative effect on learning outcomes. “We intuitively trust data or the quantitative regime more than we trust humans,” he says. “I have found no, or very few, studies that examine the use of ed tech in controlled environments.”  And there is good reason to take self-reported well-being data with caution: children may not be providing honest information. Balslev claims that when technology is introduced into a social context, it can’t be assumed that students will demonstrate ideal behavior and cooperate with its intentions. For example, in interviews he has done with high school students, he says they have reported gaming digital systems to do things like get more time for an assignment or make a writing exercise look longer than it actually is.   Though dishonest answers are of course possible, Probst and Danckert argue that Woof’s anonymous approach makes authentic responses more likely than they might be otherwise. “Many students from low-­income areas are very aware of whether they are anonymous or not. And they are very aware of what is disclosed about their family life,” says Danckert. “The students don’t want to talk about what is happening at home, because they are worried that it will start a case [with a social services agency],” Probst adds. He and Danckert believe that the anonymous approach builds trust and promotes honest disclosure, as students can be sure that it won’t trigger the teacher’s legal obligation to report red flags further up in the system.  Woof isn’t the only well-being platform making inroads in Danish schools. Platforms like Bloomsights, Moods, and Klassetrivsel (Danish for “classroom well-being”) are also getting traction. Each takes a more data-­intensive and less anonymous approach than Woof, tracking and identifying schoolchildren individually. Bloomsights and Klassetrivsel even go as far as generating “sociograms”—network diagrams that display the children’s relationships with each other in detail.  Bloomsights turns self-reported data from the same individuals over time into indicators including “signs of loneliness,” “academic mindset,” and “signs of bullying.” Bloomsights is also used in the US, where some school districts are including it as part of an “early warning system” for identifying potential school shooters.  The company’s US operations are based in Colorado. Cofounder Adam Rockenbach says the hope in bringing Bloomsights to the US was to spread the Scandinavian values of well-being and community. He asserts that the app is not meant to be a dystopian “Big Brother” but an extension of what teachers already do.  “You notice the student is coming into class, and maybe they’re coming to class late more frequently than before, and they look a little disheveled,” he says. “A good teacher is going to go find two or three minutes to connect with that student: ‘Hey, it seems like there’s something off here. Is there any way I can help you?’” Citing his experiences as a teacher in inner-city schools in Los Angeles for six years, Rockenbach says it can be a challenge to know what is really going on with children who struggle in an environment that might be marked by gang violence and poverty. He says Bloomsights can help in situations where the signals are not so clear. Chinese apps are dominating US app stores right now, but they could get caught in still-expanding efforts to ban TikTok. Rockenbach believes that anonymous data only makes early intervention more difficult, since it creates more work for teachers and educators in trying to identify who has problems and needs help. For this reason, he thinks collecting individual data is a necessity. The program, which operates through a web app, takes self-reporting measurements similar to Woof’s: monthly surveys of students, measuring various indicators of mental and physical well-being and students’ evaluation of their learning environment.  But Bloomsights stands out in its use of sociograms, which are constructed from the students’ reports of who their friends are and who they connect and spend time with. Rockenbach says these sociograms are crucial tools to detect social isolation and might even help identify children who are vulnerable to bullying. He points to testimonial reports from schools as an indicator that the platform helps improve well-being. But, he adds, “we haven’t conducted a full-on research project that might compare, for example, a school that uses Bloomsights versus a school that doesn’t. That’s something that we’re looking to do.” Indeed, some teachers wonder how useful—or even ethical—the app is. “It’s some very intimate things that are asked, and they [the children] don’t necessarily know who is going to see it,” says Naya Marie Nord, a teacher at a suburban Copenhagen school that uses Bloomsights. “Of course, I as a teacher should have insight into how my students are feeling. But that’s something that I prefer to have conveyed in the confidentiality between me and the student, rather than it being told to a computer.” Nord is concerned about how many teachers who don’t work directly with the children still have access to their data. She believes the app straddles ethical boundaries given how much it impinges on students’ private lives.  “They have no chance of understanding what is going on. It’s not like we give them a long presentation explaining how it’s used and who has access [to the data],” Nord says. “And if we did, we would get no honest answers. If they actually understood the amount of data I can see about them and how many others can see it as well, I believe they would answer differently.” According to the data policies of Klassetrivsel, one of the platforms that collect non-anonymized data, consent is not required from either parents or children before the app is used in the classroom. The company claims that since the app is an integrated tool used for “well-being purposes” at a public institution, it falls under a Danish legal clause that exempts public authorities from requirements about obtaining consent for data collection. And since the platforms aren’t classified as “information society services” like Facebook or Google, there is no parental consent required under the General Data Protection Regulation, the European Union’s sweeping data privacy law.  Legal precedents seem to back up Klassetrivsel’s claims about how the data law applies to its work. In 2019, a parent submitted a complaint to the Danish Data Protection Agency, claiming that a data-driven well-being platform at her child’s school was engaging in forced monitoring of the child. The parent further argued that “measuring and monitoring well-being is not the same as improving well-being.” The agency ruled in favor of the school’s municipality: the app was deemed a tool for maintaining tasks of “crucial social interest” that fall under the responsibility of schools. “Usually, the legal authority that these third-party apps operate under is that they are offering a service on behalf of the public authorities,” says Allan Frank, an IT lawyer at the agency. But they must still store data correctly and not collect more than is necessary. They must also operate under the aegis of governmental authorization, he says: “If there is a random teacher or a school that has been convinced to suddenly set it up without the supervision of the municipality or the Ministry of Education, then that would be a problem.” In Denmark, parents can opt out if they don’t want data collected on their children through these apps. According to Bloomsights, this is also the case in the US: although practices vary, Rockenbach says that parents typically sign a paper once a year that lists all the different services the school uses.  But because the apps are used in an educational context and are framed as altruistic, both parents and policymakers tend to have their guard down. “There are a lot of other apps where I limit my son’s use, but I’m not concerned about apps used in the school the same way I am about TikTok and YouTube, for example,” says Janni Hindborg Christiansen, mother of one of the children in the fifth-grade classroom that uses Woof. “At least Woof is used in a controlled environment and has a good purpose. I trust it more than so many other apps that I’d be more critical toward.” And for parents who don’t want their children using such platforms, opting out is not always straightforward.  Henriette Viskum, the teacher of the fifth-grade class, describes Woof lessons as a part of her class’s core programming, just like math, and says parents need to talk with the teacher to pull their child out of the program. “If it’s a huge problem, we’ll find a solution and then the child doesn’t have to participate,” Viskum says. “But then I would, as a teacher, put a big question mark around why the parents are so strongly opposed to working with well-being. I would be a bit concerned and curious about that.”  The closeness between teachers and students can also make the degree of anonymity blurry. Viskum told me that if almost an entire class reports high scores on family life, for example, but one child does not, she can usually intuit who that person is and might casually try to take steps to help. For Balslev, the embrace of slick data-driven solutions is due partly to their political appeal. In Denmark, technology sometimes tends to be presented as the solution to everything connected to teaching and education. The simple infographics that ed-tech companies offer, he says, have an allure for government officials faced with thorny social and pedagogical issues. “What is fantastic about the digital [initiatives] is that they are good at making politicians look actionable—as if they have made some decisions,” Balslev says.  But efficacy is not as much of a priority, he says: “It’s quick and easy to produce some metrics that appear rhetorically convincing. The infographic might provide a very thin sliver of truth about reality, but it doesn’t touch the core of the situation.” “The infographic might provide a very thin sliver of truth about reality, but it doesn’t touch the core of the situation.” In fact, the technology risks actually making the situation worse, says Karen Vallgårda, the University of Copenhagen researcher. She is concerned that the “surveillance paradigm” could have unintended consequences for children’s self-understanding.  Going to sleep in virtual reality can alleviate insomnia and loneliness—if you can avoid being harassed by kids. “If we are asked to monitor ourselves according to a quantitative logic, emotions such as indignation and sorrow can appear as problematic emotional reactions, despite the fact that they are completely natural in certain scenarios of life. The children can feel that what they are feeling is wrong or undesirable, which is likely to propel greater well-­being issues rather than ameliorating them,” Vallgårda says. “When we instill a measure of self-­surveillance with children based on a clearly communicated ideal of how to structure one’s everyday life, one’s eating habits, and how to feel in certain contexts, there is a risk that children develop ‘double unhappiness’ due to not just being unhappy but also failing to live up to these ideals.” Vallgårda’s concerns are echoed by other researchers, who argue that an excessive focus on whether children are happy can cause them to pathologize normal fluctuations in life. New studies also indicate that declining well-being is largely attributed to environmental and social pressures rather than individual factors. Vallgårda believes that rather than pouring resources into tools that further a quantitative agenda, schools should instead be prioritizing efforts to hire and train professionals like teachers and school psychologists. But digital platforms are significantly cheaper than hiring or training more people. Viskum, the fifth-grade teacher, points out that budgets are tight and waiting lists for appointments with the school psychologist are miles long. Given the material reality, the appeal of ed tech is understandable, even when there are few results to back it up.  While the quantification of children’s lives might make academics balk, the children I met told me that they enjoyed using Woof and especially liked how the app helped them talk more nicely to each other. At a school I visited in a low-income neighborhood (the class scored 3.4 on the mood scale), a teacher said she was just happy to have a tool that might give her a general idea of what was going on with the children. When I asked Woof’s Probst about Vallgårda’s criticisms, he said that unlike researchers studying children academically, those who work with children every day in the classroom can’t afford to think in abstract terms.  “It’s all well and good to be a theorist and have the opinion that you shouldn’t be doing certain things, but there is also a reality out there in the classrooms,” he says. “There is a practical situation where teachers face children who are struggling so much that they break down in tears during class. You have to do something there.”  Arian Khameneh is a freelance journalist based in Copenhagen.

( The problem isn ’ t exclusive to Denmark : depressive episodes among US teens increased by some 60 % between 2007 and 2017 , and teen suicide rates have also leaped by around 60 % over the same period . ) A recent open letter signed by more than 1,000 Danish school psychologists expressed “ serious concerns ” over the mental state of the children they see in their work and warned that if action isn ’ t taken immediately , they “ see no hope for turning the negative trend around. ” To help address the problem , some Danish schools are moving to address children ’ s well-being through platforms like Woof , the one used in the fifth-grade classroom . Built by a Denmark-based startup , it frequently surveys schoolchildren on a variety of well-being indicators and uses an algorithm to suggest particular issues for the class to focus on . Going to sleep in virtual reality can alleviate insomnia and loneliness—if you can avoid being harassed by kids . These platforms are quickly gaining ground . Woof , for example , has been implemented in classrooms in more than 600 schools across Denmark , with more on the way . Its founders believe Woof fills an important niche : they say teachers have expressed widespread dissatisfaction with existing tools , in particular a government-run well-being survey . That survey audits schools once a year and delivers results on a delay ; it might provide a snapshot for policymakers but is hardly useful for teachers , who need regular feedback to adjust their work . “ There is simply a need for tools to check in [ with the children ] where you don ’ t need to be active , ” says Mathias Probst , a cofounder of Woof . “ Where you don ’ t need to talk to all 24 children before starting a class , because before you know it , 15 minutes of class time has already passed. ” And teachers could benefit , he suggests , from “ something that can bring a data structure into all of this. ” Woof is not alone in its attempt to quantify children ’ s moods . A handful of other platforms have been adopted by Danish schools , and schools in Finland and the UK are using mood-monitoring software as well . In the US , the tech can extend beyond collecting self-reports to hunting for hints of concerning behavior by surveilling students ’ emails , chat messages , and searches on school-issued devices . A number of people say mood-­monitoring tech has great potential . “ We can use digital tools to evaluate well-­being on a 24-hour basis . How is the sleep ? How is the physical activity , how is the interaction with others ? ... How does [ the child ’ s ] screen time compare to physical time ? That ’ s central to understanding what well-being actually is , ” the late Carsten Obel , who was a professor of public health at Aarhus University and a leader in the development of another student-surveying tool called Moods , said in a 2019 video . But some experts are heavily skeptical of the approach . They say there is little evidence that quantification of this sort can be used to solve social problems , and that fostering a habit of self-surveillance from an early age could fundamentally alter children ’ s relationship to themselves and each other in a way that makes them feel worse rather than better . “ We can hardly go to a restaurant or to the theater without being asked how we feel about it afterwards and ticking boxes here and there , ” says Karen Vallgårda , an associate professor at the University of Copenhagen who studies family and childhood history . “ There is a quantification of emotions and experiences that is growing , and it ’ s important that we ask ourselves whether that ’ s the ideal approach when it comes to children ’ s well-being. ” Others are asking how much children and their parents actually know about what data is being collected—and how it is being used . While some platforms say they are collecting minimal or no personally identifiable data , others mine deep into individual children ’ s mental states , physical activity , and even friend groups . “ Their practice is very Silicon Valley–like . They preach data transparency but have none themselves , ” says Jesper Balslev , a research consultant at the Copenhagen School of Design and Technology , of some of these platforms . Balslev says he is concerned that Woof and other platforms are being swiftly and naively rolled out without adequate regulation , testing , or efforts to make sure that the school culture allows children to abstain from participating in them . “ Our regulatory technologies to deal with this are terrible , ” he says . It ’ s possible that will change , he adds , “ but right now , all the hobs are turned on at the same time. ” Woof is run from a basement office on the outskirts of Copenhagen , with a small team of three full-time staffers . The founders , Mathias Probst and Amalie Danckert , got the idea for the company after working as public school teachers through Teach First Denmark , an organization similar to Teach for America in the United States . When Probst and Danckert entered the public school system , they say , they quickly realized that schools in low-income neighborhoods face a vicious cycle . Difficult circumstances at home can make students in these schools more challenging to teach . Staff turnover rates are high because of stress and burnout , with some teachers keen to switch to “ easier ” schools . Parents with resources often take their children elsewhere , so kids with more problems make up an even greater proportion of those who remain , exacerbating the stress teachers face and the likelihood that they ’ ll leave . All this compounds the well-being crisis that children are experiencing elsewhere . “ I saw so many children ending up in difficult situations , which could have been prevented if action had been taken earlier , ” says Danckert , who before her stint as a teacher worked as an analyst in the children and youth section of Copenhagen ’ s Social Services Administration . Danckert and Probst , who has a background in consulting , set out to build a way to help schools manage such situations before they spiral into serious mental-health problems—problems that schools ’ thinly stretched counseling systems may not catch until it ’ s too late . Woof , the solution they devised , is a web app that children can access on computers or phones ( a 2019 study found that 98 % of Danish children between 10 and 15 have access to a smartphone ) . Its user interface primarily features a cartoon dog , which asks the children various questions about their life . The tool is designed to be used on a weekly basis , generating a “ mood landscape ” for the class by prompting kids to rate their mood and other aspects of their lives on a 1–5 scale . The result is supposed to add up to a comprehensive image of child welfare in that classroom over time . Teachers and administrative staff can read weekly reports on a class ’ s overall self-reported mood and how factors like their sleep hygiene , social activity , academic performance , and physical activity affect that mood . Classrooms are profiled , and interventions are recommended to improve the scores in categories where they are doing less well . Finally , the teacher and the children look at the data together and help each other with tools and strategies to improve these sticking points . “ It ’ s worrying that there is so much personally attributable data on platforms working with children. ” Woof ’ s data is anonymized ; the app reports on classroom averages instead of individual children . Danckert says that ’ s because the company was unwilling to walk right up to the edge of what was legally and ethically feasible under data privacy laws . Probst also describes feeling uneasy that collecting data on individual children might create a narrative and lock them into it , rather than helping them break negative patterns . “ It ’ s worrying that there is so much personally attributable data on platforms working with children , ” he says . The startup fully launched Woof less than a year ago , in the fall of 2022 . According to beta test data collected on 30 schools before its full launch , 80 % of classes that use Woof see mood improve by , on average , 0.35 points on the 1–5 scale within one month . Woof maintains that the platform isn ’ t meant to replace teacher-student contact . It should rather be understood as a support tool for teachers that provides structured action plans and feedback . But some experts have doubts about whether Woof ’ s methods are effective . They are particularly skeptical about the self-reported nature of the platform ’ s data . According to Balslev , education apps have not proved that they perform any better than analog interventions , such as having teachers advise children to turn off their computers and ask them how they slept last night . He points to historical lessons , such as a 2015 OECD study finding that digitalization in schools in a variety of countries had exacerbated a range of problems it was supposed to improve , with a net negative effect on learning outcomes . “ We intuitively trust data or the quantitative regime more than we trust humans , ” he says . “ I have found no , or very few , studies that examine the use of ed tech in controlled environments. ” And there is good reason to take self-reported well-being data with caution : children may not be providing honest information . Balslev claims that when technology is introduced into a social context , it can ’ t be assumed that students will demonstrate ideal behavior and cooperate with its intentions . For example , in interviews he has done with high school students , he says they have reported gaming digital systems to do things like get more time for an assignment or make a writing exercise look longer than it actually is . Though dishonest answers are of course possible , Probst and Danckert argue that Woof ’ s anonymous approach makes authentic responses more likely than they might be otherwise . “ Many students from low-­income areas are very aware of whether they are anonymous or not . And they are very aware of what is disclosed about their family life , ” says Danckert . “ The students don ’ t want to talk about what is happening at home , because they are worried that it will start a case [ with a social services agency ] , ” Probst adds . He and Danckert believe that the anonymous approach builds trust and promotes honest disclosure , as students can be sure that it won ’ t trigger the teacher ’ s legal obligation to report red flags further up in the system . Woof isn ’ t the only well-being platform making inroads in Danish schools . Platforms like Bloomsights , Moods , and Klassetrivsel ( Danish for “ classroom well-being ” ) are also getting traction . Each takes a more data-­intensive and less anonymous approach than Woof , tracking and identifying schoolchildren individually . Bloomsights and Klassetrivsel even go as far as generating “ sociograms ” —network diagrams that display the children ’ s relationships with each other in detail . Bloomsights turns self-reported data from the same individuals over time into indicators including “ signs of loneliness , ” “ academic mindset , ” and “ signs of bullying. ” Bloomsights is also used in the US , where some school districts are including it as part of an “ early warning system ” for identifying potential school shooters . The company ’ s US operations are based in Colorado . Cofounder Adam Rockenbach says the hope in bringing Bloomsights to the US was to spread the Scandinavian values of well-being and community . He asserts that the app is not meant to be a dystopian “ Big Brother ” but an extension of what teachers already do . “ You notice the student is coming into class , and maybe they ’ re coming to class late more frequently than before , and they look a little disheveled , ” he says . “ A good teacher is going to go find two or three minutes to connect with that student : ‘ Hey , it seems like there ’ s something off here . Is there any way I can help you ? ’ ” Citing his experiences as a teacher in inner-city schools in Los Angeles for six years , Rockenbach says it can be a challenge to know what is really going on with children who struggle in an environment that might be marked by gang violence and poverty . He says Bloomsights can help in situations where the signals are not so clear . Chinese apps are dominating US app stores right now , but they could get caught in still-expanding efforts to ban TikTok . Rockenbach believes that anonymous data only makes early intervention more difficult , since it creates more work for teachers and educators in trying to identify who has problems and needs help . For this reason , he thinks collecting individual data is a necessity . The program , which operates through a web app , takes self-reporting measurements similar to Woof ’ s : monthly surveys of students , measuring various indicators of mental and physical well-being and students ’ evaluation of their learning environment . But Bloomsights stands out in its use of sociograms , which are constructed from the students ’ reports of who their friends are and who they connect and spend time with . Rockenbach says these sociograms are crucial tools to detect social isolation and might even help identify children who are vulnerable to bullying . He points to testimonial reports from schools as an indicator that the platform helps improve well-being . But , he adds , “ we haven ’ t conducted a full-on research project that might compare , for example , a school that uses Bloomsights versus a school that doesn ’ t . That ’ s something that we ’ re looking to do. ” Indeed , some teachers wonder how useful—or even ethical—the app is . “ It ’ s some very intimate things that are asked , and they [ the children ] don ’ t necessarily know who is going to see it , ” says Naya Marie Nord , a teacher at a suburban Copenhagen school that uses Bloomsights . “ Of course , I as a teacher should have insight into how my students are feeling . But that ’ s something that I prefer to have conveyed in the confidentiality between me and the student , rather than it being told to a computer. ” Nord is concerned about how many teachers who don ’ t work directly with the children still have access to their data . She believes the app straddles ethical boundaries given how much it impinges on students ’ private lives . “ They have no chance of understanding what is going on . It ’ s not like we give them a long presentation explaining how it ’ s used and who has access [ to the data ] , ” Nord says . “ And if we did , we would get no honest answers . If they actually understood the amount of data I can see about them and how many others can see it as well , I believe they would answer differently. ” According to the data policies of Klassetrivsel , one of the platforms that collect non-anonymized data , consent is not required from either parents or children before the app is used in the classroom . The company claims that since the app is an integrated tool used for “ well-being purposes ” at a public institution , it falls under a Danish legal clause that exempts public authorities from requirements about obtaining consent for data collection . And since the platforms aren ’ t classified as “ information society services ” like Facebook or Google , there is no parental consent required under the General Data Protection Regulation , the European Union ’ s sweeping data privacy law . Legal precedents seem to back up Klassetrivsel ’ s claims about how the data law applies to its work . In 2019 , a parent submitted a complaint to the Danish Data Protection Agency , claiming that a data-driven well-being platform at her child ’ s school was engaging in forced monitoring of the child . The parent further argued that “ measuring and monitoring well-being is not the same as improving well-being. ” The agency ruled in favor of the school ’ s municipality : the app was deemed a tool for maintaining tasks of “ crucial social interest ” that fall under the responsibility of schools . “ Usually , the legal authority that these third-party apps operate under is that they are offering a service on behalf of the public authorities , ” says Allan Frank , an IT lawyer at the agency . But they must still store data correctly and not collect more than is necessary . They must also operate under the aegis of governmental authorization , he says : “ If there is a random teacher or a school that has been convinced to suddenly set it up without the supervision of the municipality or the Ministry of Education , then that would be a problem. ” In Denmark , parents can opt out if they don ’ t want data collected on their children through these apps . According to Bloomsights , this is also the case in the US : although practices vary , Rockenbach says that parents typically sign a paper once a year that lists all the different services the school uses . But because the apps are used in an educational context and are framed as altruistic , both parents and policymakers tend to have their guard down . “ There are a lot of other apps where I limit my son ’ s use , but I ’ m not concerned about apps used in the school the same way I am about TikTok and YouTube , for example , ” says Janni Hindborg Christiansen , mother of one of the children in the fifth-grade classroom that uses Woof . “ At least Woof is used in a controlled environment and has a good purpose . I trust it more than so many other apps that I ’ d be more critical toward. ” And for parents who don ’ t want their children using such platforms , opting out is not always straightforward . Henriette Viskum , the teacher of the fifth-grade class , describes Woof lessons as a part of her class ’ s core programming , just like math , and says parents need to talk with the teacher to pull their child out of the program . “ If it ’ s a huge problem , we ’ ll find a solution and then the child doesn ’ t have to participate , ” Viskum says . “ But then I would , as a teacher , put a big question mark around why the parents are so strongly opposed to working with well-being . I would be a bit concerned and curious about that. ” The closeness between teachers and students can also make the degree of anonymity blurry . Viskum told me that if almost an entire class reports high scores on family life , for example , but one child does not , she can usually intuit who that person is and might casually try to take steps to help . For Balslev , the embrace of slick data-driven solutions is due partly to their political appeal . In Denmark , technology sometimes tends to be presented as the solution to everything connected to teaching and education . The simple infographics that ed-tech companies offer , he says , have an allure for government officials faced with thorny social and pedagogical issues . “ What is fantastic about the digital [ initiatives ] is that they are good at making politicians look actionable—as if they have made some decisions , ” Balslev says . But efficacy is not as much of a priority , he says : “ It ’ s quick and easy to produce some metrics that appear rhetorically convincing . The infographic might provide a very thin sliver of truth about reality , but it doesn ’ t touch the core of the situation. ” “ The infographic might provide a very thin sliver of truth about reality , but it doesn ’ t touch the core of the situation. ” In fact , the technology risks actually making the situation worse , says Karen Vallgårda , the University of Copenhagen researcher . She is concerned that the “ surveillance paradigm ” could have unintended consequences for children ’ s self-understanding . Going to sleep in virtual reality can alleviate insomnia and loneliness—if you can avoid being harassed by kids . “ If we are asked to monitor ourselves according to a quantitative logic , emotions such as indignation and sorrow can appear as problematic emotional reactions , despite the fact that they are completely natural in certain scenarios of life . The children can feel that what they are feeling is wrong or undesirable , which is likely to propel greater well-­being issues rather than ameliorating them , ” Vallgårda says . “ When we instill a measure of self-­surveillance with children based on a clearly communicated ideal of how to structure one ’ s everyday life , one ’ s eating habits , and how to feel in certain contexts , there is a risk that children develop ‘ double unhappiness ’ due to not just being unhappy but also failing to live up to these ideals. ” Vallgårda ’ s concerns are echoed by other researchers , who argue that an excessive focus on whether children are happy can cause them to pathologize normal fluctuations in life . New studies also indicate that declining well-being is largely attributed to environmental and social pressures rather than individual factors . Vallgårda believes that rather than pouring resources into tools that further a quantitative agenda , schools should instead be prioritizing efforts to hire and train professionals like teachers and school psychologists . But digital platforms are significantly cheaper than hiring or training more people . Viskum , the fifth-grade teacher , points out that budgets are tight and waiting lists for appointments with the school psychologist are miles long . Given the material reality , the appeal of ed tech is understandable , even when there are few results to back it up . While the quantification of children ’ s lives might make academics balk , the children I met told me that they enjoyed using Woof and especially liked how the app helped them talk more nicely to each other . At a school I visited in a low-income neighborhood ( the class scored 3.4 on the mood scale ) , a teacher said she was just happy to have a tool that might give her a general idea of what was going on with the children . When I asked Woof ’ s Probst about Vallgårda ’ s criticisms , he said that unlike researchers studying children academically , those who work with children every day in the classroom can ’ t afford to think in abstract terms . “ It ’ s all well and good to be a theorist and have the opinion that you shouldn ’ t be doing certain things , but there is also a reality out there in the classrooms , ” he says . “ There is a practical situation where teachers face children who are struggling so much that they break down in tears during class . You have to do something there. ” Arian Khameneh is a freelance journalist based in Copenhagen .","['copenhagen', 'suburb', 'fifthgrade', 'classroom', 'weekly', 'cakeeate', 'session', 'common',
