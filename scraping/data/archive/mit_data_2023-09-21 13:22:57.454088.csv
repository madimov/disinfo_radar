Make Machine Learning Work for You,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/09/20/1079506/make-machine-learning-work-for-you/,2023-09-20,"The enthusiasm for AI and its applications is reaching a nadir, according to an August 2023 Gartner Hype Cycle press release, where generative AI is nearly perched atop the category of technologies at their “Peak of Inflated Expectations,” ready to plunge into the “Trough of Disillusionment.” A quick look at social media agrees, with some…","Provided byCapital One The enthusiasm for AI and its applications is reaching a nadir, according to an August 2023 Gartner Hype Cycle press release, where generative AI is nearly perched atop the category of technologies at their “Peak of Inflated Expectations,” ready to plunge into the “Trough of Disillusionment.” A quick look at social media agrees, with some pages filled with targeted advertisements about topics as prosaic as “GPT for your pile of receipts.” This is good evidence that the AI craze is becoming a hammer looking for a nail. Yet, with all this fervor, according to McKinsey, while AI adoption has more than doubled since 2017, it has leveled off at around 50% to 60% during the past few years. IBM reveals that nearly half of the challenges related to AI adoption focus on data complexity (24%) and difficulty integrating and scaling projects (24%). While it may be expedient for marketers to “slap a GPT suffix on it and call it AI,” businesses striving to truly implement and incorporate AI and ML face a two-headed challenge: first, it’s difficult and expensive, and second, because it’s difficult and expensive, it’s hard to come by the “sandboxes” that are necessary to enable experimentation and prove “green shoots” of value that would warrant further investment. In short, AI and ML are inaccessible. History shows that most business shifts at first seem difficult and expensive. However, spending time and resources on these efforts has paid off for the innovators. Businesses identify new assets, and use new processes to achieve new goals—sometimes lofty, unexpected ones. The asset at the focus of the AI craze is data. The world is exploding with data. According to a 2020 report by Seagate and IDC, during the next two years, enterprise data is projected to increase at a 42.2% annual growth rate. And yet, only 32% of that data is currently being put to work. Effective data management—storing, labeling, cataloging, securing, connecting, and making queryable—has no shortage of challenges. Once those challenges are overcome, businesses will need to identify users not only technically proficient enough to access and leverage that data, but also able to do so in a comprehensive manner. Businesses today find themselves tasking garden-variety analysts with targeted, hypothesis-driven work. The shorthand is encapsulated in a common refrain: “I usually have analysts pull down a subset of the data and run pivot tables on it.” To avoid tunnel vision and use data more comprehensively, this hypothesis-driven analysis is supplemented with business intelligence (BI), where data at scale is finessed into reports, dashboards, and visualizations. But even then, the dizzying scale of charts and graphs requires the person reviewing them to have a strong sense of what matters and what to look for—again, to be hypothesis-driven—in order to make sense of the world. Human beings simply cannot otherwise handle the cognitive overload. The moment is opportune for AI and ML. Ideally, that would mean plentiful teams of data scientists, data engineers, and ML engineers that can deliver such solutions, at a price that folds neatly into IT budgets. Also ideally, businesses are ready with the right amount of technology; GPUs, compute, and orchestration infrastructure to build and deploy AI and ML solutions at scale. But much like the business revolutions of days past, this isn’t the case. The marketplace is offering a proliferation of solutions based on two approaches: adding even more intelligence and insights to existing BI tools; and making it increasingly easier to develop and deploy ML solutions, in the growing field of ML operations, or MLOps. BI is making significant inroads on augmenting its capabilities with ML, but still has the intrinsic cognitive overload challenge to overcome. ML capabilities are so embedded in BI interfaces that they aren’t easily extracted to be applied in more bespoke ways. MLOps comes from the other direction, by easing the development and promotion of ML models. The challenge for MLOps is, while it makes data scientists and ML engineers more productive—more building and training models, and less wrangling data, deploying, and productionizing—it doesn’t address the fact that those very data scientists and ML engineers remain scarce and expensive in the first place. The onus is therefore on businesses to find solutions that can enable non-Ph.D, traditional analysts to become effective ML practitioners. This is ML Democratization. Capital One began laying the foundations for the journey to ML democratization more than a decade ago, when it went all-in on the cloud, creating a modern computing environment that enables instant provisioning of infrastructure and increased processing power. This modern computing environment makes complex and large-scale data set analysis possible at increasing levels of efficiency. Capital One adopted a philosophy of centralized and standardized platforms and governance. For AI and ML, it built an ML platform that provides engineers and scientists with governed access to algorithms, components, and infrastructure for reuse. The computing environment and platform philosophy provided necessary, but not sufficient, ingredients to democratize ML. Infusing a “no hammers looking for nails” mantra, Capital One’s team of ML engineers and data scientists went with a business problem-first approach. Instead of gathering technical requirements the team gathered problem statements. For instance, Capital One’s credit card transaction fraud team looked for a way to comprehensively detect pockets of fraud and automatically create real-time defenses. So the company developed ML algorithms, components, and infrastructure to build a solution. In the process, those components were published to a central ML platform to be reused and improved upon for future business problems requiring similar approaches. As organizations expand their range of business use cases and develop solutions, they often find recurring patterns that can be harnessed for wider benefit. Recognizing these patterns can lead to a powerful realization: by making commonly used ML libraries, workflows, and components accessible through user-friendly interfaces, businesses can unleash the potential of ML across their enterprise, without requiring deep data science or engineering expertise. This democratization of ML serves as a solution to several challenges, including cognitive overload, resource constraints, and accessibility issues. It paves the way for a culture of experimentation, essential for turning ML into a valuable tool rather than just a passing trend. Now, if a business analyst wants to identify anomalies or track trends in their portfolio's granular segments, or if a marketing associate wants to perform in-depth campaign analysis beyond what traditional analytics tools offer, ML can meet these needs with minimal demands on engineering resources. Using ML democratization transforms it from a shiny object into a centerpiece of practical value. In a single working day, an analyst with no prior ML knowledge or coding skills can uncover insightful information from any dataset of their choice. This shift significantly reduces the cost associated with exploring ML's potential and its application across various business areas. No-code ML solutions could play a pivotal role in achieving ML democratization. We’re already seeing it happen, and ML will continue to become more accessible through technology advancements including no-code solutions. This ML democratization will allow business analysts to confidently make decisions they wouldn’t have previously considered, resulting in profound and lasting impacts.

The deepfake avatars who want to sell you everything,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/09/20/1079885/chinese-deepfake-livestream-foreign-language/,2023-09-20,"<p>AI-generated livestreamers can speak any language, making it easier for Chinese brands to capture an audience abroad.</p>
","This story first appeared in China Report, MIT Technology Review’s newsletter about technology developments in China. Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Tuesday. Writing about China, a question I always get is: What technology is ubiquitous there but hasn’t caught on in the West? One of my go-to answers is livestream e-commerce.  If you don’t live in China, it’s hard to comprehend just how massively popular livestream e-commerce is. Over 500 million Chinese people are watching it regularly; these streams brokered $4.6 trillion in sales last year—meaning more than one-quarter of all purchases made online in China were from livestreams. It’s not surprising that tech companies have been trying to bring that lucrative business outside China. I covered this push as early as in 2020, when AliExpress, Alibaba’s overseas arm, was hiring foreign talent to create similar shopping streams in English, Russian, and other languages. But the idea has never been accepted by mainstream viewers elsewhere, even though Chinese companies keep trying. Most recently, TikTok announced last week that it’s officially rolling out its livestream shopping features in the US. (Even this has a sense of déjà vu; it’s something the company has been saying it’s always about to do … since 2021.)  Nevertheless, it’s safe to say that the appetite for livestream shopping still doesn’t exist in the US. Juozas Kaziukėnas, an e-commerce analyst who founded the firm Marketplace Pulse, tweeted that even fervent fans of TikTok aren’t necessarily excited about it, quoting another tweet from last week: “tiktok shop has ruined the whole app, it’s all ads and reviews instead of silly little videos.”  All that said, Chinese livestreamers now have an unprecedented opportunity to break through—with the help of AI. With just a few minutes of sample video and $1,000, brands never have to stop selling their products. Today, I published a story about how cheap and convenient AI tools are enabling brands to create countless deepfake streamers on China’s e-commerce platforms. The developers require only one minute of video for training a “streamer,” and charge about $1,000 for AI-generated avatars that can speak and act (almost) like real humans in front of the cameras. They have already been deployed in thousands of shopping livestreams. Read the full story here. This may help eliminate one of the biggest obstacles to bringing Chinese-style livestream shopping abroad: the lack of foreign talent who understand how livestream e-commerce works, perform naturally in front of the camera, and are willing to talk for hours every day following a largely repetitive routine. In China, there are schools that specifically train aspiring streamers for such work, but the same ecosystem simply doesn’t exist anywhere else yet. Sometimes e-commerce brands take innovative measures to address the talent gap. Chen Dan, CEO of Chinese AI streamer marketing company Quantum Planet, says he saw a Chinese bluetooth headphone brand hire Thai-speaking voice actors to record audio, which then plays over video of just a hand presenting and testing the products, making it seem as if the same person showcasing the product is also speaking Thai. But with large language models and text-to-speech technologies, these AI streamers can say whatever you want them to say—meaning they can speak other languages too. Just last week a new AI-translation product was blowing up on social media: LA-based HeyGen launched a tool that translates video into seven different languages, clones the speaker’s voice, and syncs the speaker’s lips so everything looks natural. The result (including translation to Hindi, the only non-Western language offered now) is surprisingly good! With tools like this, it’s no longer necessary to find local talent for livestreams. “Language is actually an advantage of virtual streamers [compared to humans]. Many of our clients are interested in doing cross-border e-commerce in Southeast Asia. The demand is very high,” says Huang Wei, the director of virtual influencer livestreaming business at the Chinese AI company Xiaoice.  Xiaoice and Quantum Planet now work together to pitch these AI streamers to Chinese clients. Their virtual streamers can speak 129 languages, including English and a few Southeast Asian languages, like Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian.  In March, they used a Thai-speaking AI streamer for the first time to sell furniture for a Chinese company, and sold $2,000 worth of products in an hour. I asked a native Thai speaker to watch a clip and assess the quality of the AI; he told me the intonation was so impressively natural that he almost thought it had to be the result of voice dubbing. There’s also an English version so you can judge for yourself, although I don’t think it’s on par with the Chinese or Thai versions.  Obviously the AI won’t be able to do everything a human streamer can, especially testing products in real time in response to audience questions, but it suits the companies that are just looking to break into a new market and not spend too much money for the risky venture. As the Chinese publication Huxiu reports, the monthly salary for a local streamer in Indonesia is almost the same as the cost for customizing an AI streamer, and in the long term, it costs much less to reuse the AI than to keep a real person on the payroll. Plus, the result is better than most people expect.  Could this mean that livestream e-commerce will finally get popular outside China? I’d be very cautious and say that it probably won’t be the case soon. But I do think AI could help Chinese companies expand globally by overcoming language and cultural barriers. And either way, it’s clear the technology of synthetic media is moving ahead at an incredibly fast pace, so it may only be a matter of time before Chinese e-commerce companies can finally capitalize on it.  What do you think of the English version of the AI streamer? Do you think livestream e-commerce will become popular outside China? Let me know your thoughts at zeyi@technologyreview.com. 1. The Biden administration and TikTok have come back to the negotiating table, after a hard-line stance against the viral social media company has proved unpopular among many Americans. (Washington Post $) 2. Tinder might be disappointing as a dating platform, but in China, young people are using it to find professional connections and job referrals. (Sixth Tone) 3. China's AI sector is overcrowded with newcomers who want to make it big, but the hype is gradually fading away. (Wired $) 4. As the demand for data annotation rises this year, vocational schools in China are working with annotation companies to force students to do the labor-intensive work for subminimum wages. (Rest of World) 5. The US and China are both racing to develop AI tools for espionage—hoping to gain more information on the mindset of their rival’s leaders and military capabilities. (New York Times $) 6. From his days as a student dissident who escaped Tiananmen in 1989 to his career as one of the best investors betting on Chinese companies, Li Lu’s life story is deeply intertwined with the wax and wane of US-China relations over the past three decades. (Financial Times $) 7. Barbie had a team of clearance specialists review every prop for copyright and other concerns. It never expected a cartoonish map to create controversy over China’s maritime territory claims. (Wall Street Journal $) In the past month, a major Chinese mobile game developer tried twice to set up alternative micropayment systems that circumvent Apple’s high commission fees, but it seems to have failed both times. miHoYo is the developer behind the global hit Genshin Impact, which incentivizes players to make micropayments in exchange for characters and items and has become one of the highest-grossing mobile games in the world. That means its players have paid billions of dollars through Apple’s App Store—where the US tech giant takes a 30% cut for every transaction. According to the Chinese gaming publication Core Esports, in August miHoYo tried to set up new payment channels through its community forum app and then a mini-program in the Chinese digital wallet app Alipay. The first app was soon removed from Apple’s App Store, while the second was disabled for iPhone users after just 13 days. The failed attempts to reduce revenue sharing with Apple highlight the latter’s continued influence in the mobile gaming ecosystem. But Apple is also facing regulatory pressure to open up to third-party payment methods, and major game developers have their own leverage. Maybe the third time will be the charm for miHoYo? If you live in the Chinese province of Guangdong, I’d advise you to stay indoors. After heavy rainfall and flooding across southern China, 71 crocodiles escaped from a farm where they were raised for their meat and leather. The good news is that 69 of them have been caught. The bad news is … well, there are still two at large. ","This story first appeared in China Report , MIT Technology Review ’ s newsletter about technology developments in China .

Sometimes e-commerce brands take innovative measures to address the talent gap . Chen Dan , CEO of Chinese AI streamer marketing company Quantum Planet , says he saw a Chinese bluetooth headphone brand hire Thai-speaking voice actors to record audio , which then plays over video of just a hand presenting and testing the products , making it seem as if the same person showcasing the product is also speaking Thai . But with large language models and text-to-speech technologies , these AI streamers can say whatever you want them to say—meaning they can speak other languages too . Just last week a new AI-translation product was blowing up on social media : LA-based HeyGen launched a tool that translates video into seven different languages , clones the speaker ’ s voice , and syncs the speaker ’ s lips so everything looks natural . The result ( including translation to Hindi , the only non-Western language offered now ) is surprisingly good ! With tools like this , it ’ s no longer necessary to find local talent for livestreams . “ Language is actually an advantage of virtual streamers [ compared to humans ] . Many of our clients are interested in doing cross-border e-commerce in Southeast Asia . The demand is very high , ” says Huang Wei , the director of virtual influencer livestreaming business at the Chinese AI company Xiaoice . Xiaoice and Quantum Planet now work together to pitch these AI streamers to Chinese clients . Their virtual streamers can speak 129 languages , including English and a few Southeast Asian languages , like Vietnamese , Thai , and Indonesian . In March , they used a Thai-speaking AI streamer for the first time to sell furniture for a Chinese company , and sold $ 2,000 worth of products in an hour . I asked a native Thai speaker to watch a clip and assess the quality of the AI ; he told me the intonation was so impressively natural that he almost thought it had to be the result of voice dubbing . There ’ s also an English version so you can judge for yourself , although I don ’ t think it ’ s on par with the Chinese or Thai versions . Obviously the AI won ’ t be able to do everything a human streamer can , especially testing products in real time in response to audience questions , but it suits the companies that are just looking to break into a new market and not spend too much money for the risky venture . As the Chinese publication Huxiu reports , the monthly salary for a local streamer in Indonesia is almost the same as the cost for customizing an AI streamer , and in the long term , it costs much less to reuse the AI than to keep a real person on the payroll . Plus , the result is better than most people expect . Could this mean that livestream e-commerce will finally get popular outside China ? I ’ d be very cautious and say that it probably won ’ t be the case soon . But I do think AI could help Chinese companies expand globally by overcoming language and cultural barriers . And either way , it ’ s clear the technology of synthetic media is moving ahead at an incredibly fast pace , so it may only be a matter of time before Chinese e-commerce companies can finally capitalize on it . What do you think of the English version of the AI streamer ? Do you think livestream e-commerce will become popular outside China ? Let me know your thoughts at zeyi @ technologyreview.com . 1 . The Biden administration and TikTok have come back to the negotiating table , after a hard-line stance against the viral social media company has proved unpopular among many Americans . ( Washington Post $ ) 2 . Tinder might be disappointing as a dating platform , but in China , young people are using it to find professional connections and job referrals . ( Sixth Tone ) 3 . China 's AI sector is overcrowded with newcomers who want to make it big , but the hype is gradually fading away . ( Wired $ ) 4 . As the demand for data annotation rises this year , vocational schools in China are working with annotation companies to force students to do the labor-intensive work for subminimum wages . ( Rest of World ) 5 . The US and China are both racing to develop AI tools for espionage—hoping to gain more information on the mindset of their rival ’ s leaders and military capabilities .

From his days as a student dissident who escaped Tiananmen in 1989 to his career as one of the best investors betting on Chinese companies , Li Lu ’ s life story is deeply intertwined with the wax and wane of US-China relations over the past three decades . ( Financial Times $ ) 7 . Barbie had a team of clearance specialists review every prop for copyright and other concerns . It never expected a cartoonish map to create controversy over China ’ s maritime territory claims . ( Wall Street Journal $ ) In the past month , a major Chinese mobile game developer tried twice to set up alternative micropayment systems that circumvent Apple ’ s high commission fees , but it seems to have failed both times . miHoYo is the developer behind the global hit Genshin Impact , which incentivizes players to make micropayments in exchange for characters and items and has become one of the highest-grossing mobile games in the world . That means its players have paid billions of dollars through Apple ’ s App Store—where the US tech giant takes a 30 % cut for every transaction . According to the Chinese gaming publication Core Esports , in August miHoYo tried to set up new payment channels through its community forum app and then a mini-program in the Chinese digital wallet app Alipay . The first app was soon removed from Apple ’ s App Store , while the second was disabled for iPhone users after just 13 days . The failed attempts to reduce revenue sharing with Apple highlight the latter ’ s continued influence in the mobile gaming ecosystem . But Apple is also facing regulatory pressure to open up to third-party payment methods , and major game developers have their own leverage . Maybe the third time will be the charm for miHoYo ? If you live in the Chinese province of Guangdong , I ’ d advise you to stay indoors . After heavy rainfall and flooding across southern China , 71 crocodiles escaped from a farm where they were raised for their meat and leather . The good news is that 69 of them have been caught . The bad news is … well , there are still two at large .","['story', 'first', 'appear', 'mit', 'technology', 'review', 'newsletter', 'technology', 'development', 'sign', 'receive', 'inbox', 'writing',

A Disney director tried—and failed—to use an AI Hans Zimmer to create a soundtrack,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/09/19/1079859/a-disney-director-tried-and-failed-to-use-an-ai-hans-zimmer-to-create-a-soundtrack/,2023-09-19,"<p>AI generated a “7 out of 10” track. “But the reason you go into Hans Zimmer is for 10 out of 10,” says Gareth Edwards. </p>
","Hans Zimmer, 1; AI, 0.  When Gareth Edwards, the director of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, was thinking about the soundtrack for his upcoming movie about artificial intelligence, The Creator, he decided to try composing it with AI—and got “pretty damn good” results.  “The cheeky part of me thought it’d be even better if we didn’t tell anyone—and we did the soundtrack and we kept it secret, like we invented a person’s name or something, and then when it was all done … ‘Haha, it was actually AI,’” Edwards said in a LinkedIn Live interview with MIT Technology Review. (You can watch the full interview below.) Edwards had asked an unspecified AI music company to use the tech to create a soundtrack in the style of Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer.  The AI system generated a track that was maybe a “7 out of 10,” Edwards said.  “But in the back of my head I was like, ‘But the reason you go to Hans Zimmer is for 10 out of 10,’” he added.  Edwards, who ended up using the real, flesh-and-blood human Hans Zimmer for the soundtrack of his movie, said he played the AI-generated track back to the composer. Zimmer, he said, found it amusing. Zimmer wasn’t reachable for comment.  Edwards’s experiment speaks to an issue at the heart of one of the biggest fights facing Hollywood today. Artists and creatives are up in arms over generative AI. Hollywood is currently at a standstill as actors and writers are striking over fairer labor conditions and the use of generative AI in the film industry. There is also fierce pushback from authors and artists who argue that tech companies steal their intellectual property by indiscriminately scraping the web for images and text. Prominent artists such as comedian and author Sarah Silverman have sued AI companies for copyright infringement.  It’s still early days for music-generating AI, which might explain why Edwards got the results he did, says Henry Ajder, an expert in generative AI.  “From my experience, some quite simple AI music is pretty convincing. It’s difficult to tell the difference between an AI-generated composition and a human performed composition,” he says.   But a longer piece in the style of Hans Zimmer is significantly more complex to generate than a simple piano melody with one instrument, he adds. AI systems are limited by what is in their training data, whereas human Zimmer has his imagination and the whole surrounding world to draw inspiration from.  Crucially, Edwards said, AI systems lack a fundamentally crucial skill for creating good art: taste. They still don’t understand what humans deem good or bad. For that reason, he believes that rather than fearing AI, creatives should use it. “Everyone’s very aware it’s coming. It’s a tool,” Edwards said. “The people that are going to be okay are the people who don’t deny this breakthrough is happening, and embrace it and learn it, and try to use it as a tool.”  Greg Rutkowski is a more popular prompt than Picasso. Edwards drew parallels between today’s AI boom and the invention of the photo editing software Photoshop.  When Photoshop came out, he said, the public discussion was about how the software “was sacrilegious.”  “We got over that eventually. Now Photoshop has created so many opportunities for so many people doing art … I wouldn’t want to go back,” he said.  Artificial intelligence will seismically shift the industry in the same way the invention of the camera or the digital visual effects in Jurassic Park did, Edwards said: “It’s just another one of those, I hope.”  ","Hans Zimmer , 1 ; AI , 0 .

","This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here. So smart! So talented! This week I’m pleased to introduce you to a new crop of bright minds working on some of the most challenging problems in AI and beyond. You can read MIT Technology Review’s full list of 35 Innovators Under 35 here.  We’ve previously highlighted some of the most promising people in tech before they became household names. In 2002, the list included two young innovators named Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google. A 23-year-old Mark Zuckerberg was on the list in 2007. In 2008 we featured Andrew Ng, who wrote an excellent essay for us this year sharing his tips for aspiring innovators on trying, failing, and the future of AI.  This year we’ve seen tech companies racing to release their hottest new AI systems, and often neglecting safety and ethics. The AI scientists on this year's innovators list are more aware than ever of the harm the technology can pose, and are determined to fix it. To do that, they’re pioneering new methods that are helping to shift the way the AI industry thinks about safety.  Sharon Li, pictured above and our Innovator of the Year, is an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. She created a remarkable AI safety feature called out-of-distribution detection. This feature helps AI models determine if they should abstain from action when faced with something they weren’t trained on. This is crucial as AI systems are rolled out from the lab and encounter new situations in the messy real world. Irene Solaiman, global public policy director at Hugging Face, developed an approach that calls for tech companies to release new models in phases, allowing more time to test them for failures and build in guardrails.   Many of our innovators are working to fight climate change. I was delighted to see so many people on the list using their skills in AI to tackle the biggest problem facing humanity, either by helping the AI community track and lower its emissions or by using AI to mitigate emissions in highly polluting industries. Sasha Luccioni, an AI researcher at startup Hugging Face, has developed a better way for tech companies to estimate and measure the carbon footprint of AI language models.  Catherine De Wolf of ETH Zurich is using AI to help reduce emissions and the waste of materials in the construction industry.  Alhussein Fawzi of DeepMind developed game-playing AI to speed up fundamental computations, which helps to cut costs and save energy on devices.  This year’s innovators are also working on practical applications of AI that illustrate how the technology could become more and more useful. They’re coming up with exciting new ways to use it to boost scientific research and build helpful tools in other fields. Lerrel Pinto of New York University is using AI to help robots learn from their mistakes. This, he hopes, will lead to robots in the home that do a lot more than vacuum—and could become more integral to our daily lives.  Connor Coley of MIT developed open-source software that uses artificial intelligence to help discover and synthesize new molecules.  Pranav Rajpurkar of Harvard Medical School has developed a way for AI to teach itself to accurately interpret medical images without any help from humans.  Richard Zhang, a senior research scientist at Adobe, invented the visual similarity algorithms underlying image-generating AI models like Stable Diffusion and StyleGAN. Without his work, we would not have the image-generating AI that has captivated the world.  That’s not all! This year’s list is brimming with inspiring people and ideas for the next big thing in robotics, computing, biotechnology, and climate and energy. Read the full list of this year’s young innovators here. And finally, if you work in AI and you think you’ve got some exciting, cutting-edge stuff to share, get in touch! We’re always interested in hearing from people doing interesting work. DeepMind’s cofounder: Generative AI is just a phase. What’s next is interactive AI. DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman wants to build a chatbot that does a whole lot more than chat. Here’s Suleyman’s pitch: In the future, we’ll have what he calls interactive AI, meaning bots that can carry out tasks you set for them by calling on other software and other people to get stuff done. He’s founded a new billion-dollar company, Inflection, to build it.  Come again? Suleyman, who left DeepMind in 2022, has some … interesting … thoughts about the success of online regulation, which border on naïveté. (“It’s pretty difficult to find radicalization content or terrorist material online. It’s pretty difficult to buy weapons and drugs online.”) Despite that, he remains earnest and evangelical in his convictions, and he is in a position to make big moves in the industry. He sat down with MIT Technology Review’s senior editor for AI, Will Douglas Heaven, to chat about his plans and the need for robust AI regulation. Read more here. AI just beat a human test for creativity. What does that even mean?A new study found that AI chatbots achieved higher average scores than humans in a test commonly used to assess human creativity. The findings do not necessarily indicate that AIs are developing an ability to do something uniquely human. However, they might give us a better understanding of how humans and machines approach creative tasks. (MIT Technology Review)  This driverless-car company is using chatbots to make its vehicles smarterSelf-driving-car startup Wayve can now interrogate its vehicles, asking them questions about their driving decisions—and getting answers back. The idea is to use the same tech behind ChatGPT to help train driverless cars. (MIT Technology Review)  How Silicon Valley doomers are shaping Rishi Sunak’s AI plansThe UK’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is keen to boost his country’s AI industry. But in a short span of time, something has shifted in the UK’s approach. The country seems to be becoming a cheerleader for the AI doom narrative, thanks to heavy lobbying from the effective altruism movement. (Politico)  Silicon Valley’s AI religionA thought-provoking piece about something I too have observed in the tech space: technologists are increasingly weaving a narrative around AI and artificial general intelligence that isn’t that dissimilar from religious narratives. This story connects the dots. (Vox)  How generative AI worksA great and helpful visual explainer that’s essential reading for anyone AI-curious.

In 2002 , the list included two young innovators named Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google . A 23-year-old Mark Zuckerberg was on the list in 2007 . In 2008 we featured Andrew Ng , who wrote an excellent essay for us this year sharing his tips for aspiring innovators on trying , failing , and the future of AI . This year we ’ ve seen tech companies racing to release their hottest new AI systems , and often neglecting safety and ethics . The AI scientists on this year 's innovators list are more aware than ever of the harm the technology can pose , and are determined to fix it . To do that , they ’ re pioneering new methods that are helping to shift the way the AI industry thinks about safety . Sharon Li , pictured above and our Innovator of the Year , is an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin , Madison . She created a remarkable AI safety feature called out-of-distribution detection . This feature helps AI models determine if they should abstain from action when faced with something they weren ’ t trained on . This is crucial as AI systems are rolled out from the lab and encounter new situations in the messy real world . Irene Solaiman , global public policy director at Hugging Face , developed an approach that calls for tech companies to release new models in phases , allowing more time to test them for failures and build in guardrails . Many of our innovators are working to fight climate change . I was delighted to see so many people on the list using their skills in AI to tackle the biggest problem facing humanity , either by helping the AI community track and lower its emissions or by using AI to mitigate emissions in highly polluting industries . Sasha Luccioni , an AI researcher at startup Hugging Face , has developed a better way for tech companies to estimate and measure the carbon footprint of AI language models . Catherine De Wolf of ETH Zurich is using AI to help reduce emissions and the waste of materials in the construction industry . Alhussein Fawzi of DeepMind developed game-playing AI to speed up fundamental computations , which helps to cut costs and save energy on devices . This year ’ s innovators are also working on practical applications of AI that illustrate how the technology could become more and more useful . They ’ re coming up with exciting new ways to use it to boost scientific research and build helpful tools in other fields . Lerrel Pinto of New York University is using AI to help robots learn from their mistakes . This , he hopes , will lead to robots in the home that do a lot more than vacuum—and could become more integral to our daily lives . Connor Coley of MIT developed open-source software that uses artificial intelligence to help discover and synthesize new molecules . Pranav Rajpurkar of Harvard Medical School has developed a way for AI to teach itself to accurately interpret medical images without any help from humans . Richard Zhang , a senior research scientist at Adobe , invented the visual similarity algorithms underlying image-generating AI models like Stable Diffusion and StyleGAN . Without his work , we would not have the image-generating AI that has captivated the world . That ’ s not all ! This year ’ s list is brimming with inspiring people and ideas for the next big thing in robotics , computing , biotechnology , and climate and energy . Read the full list of this year ’ s young innovators here . And finally , if you work in AI and you think you ’ ve got some exciting , cutting-edge stuff to share , get in touch ! We ’ re always interested in hearing from people doing interesting work . DeepMind ’ s cofounder : Generative AI is just a phase . What ’ s next is interactive AI . DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman wants to build a chatbot that does a whole lot more than chat . Here ’ s Suleyman ’ s pitch : In the future , we ’ ll have what he calls interactive AI , meaning bots that can carry out tasks you set for them by calling on other software and other people to get stuff done . He ’ s founded a new billion-dollar company , Inflection , to build it . Come again ? Suleyman , who left DeepMind in 2022 , has some … interesting … thoughts about the success of online regulation , which border on naïveté . ( “ It ’ s pretty difficult to find radicalization content or terrorist material online . It ’ s pretty difficult to buy weapons and drugs online. ” ) Despite that , he remains earnest and evangelical in his convictions , and he is in a position to make big moves in the industry . He sat down with MIT Technology Review ’ s senior editor for AI , Will Douglas Heaven , to chat about his plans and the need for robust AI regulation . Read more here . AI just beat a human test for creativity . What does that even mean ? A new study found that AI chatbots achieved higher average scores than humans in a test commonly used to assess human creativity . The findings do not necessarily indicate that AIs are developing an ability to do something uniquely human . However , they might give us a better understanding of how humans and machines approach creative tasks . ( MIT Technology Review ) This driverless-car company is using chatbots to make its vehicles smarterSelf-driving-car startup Wayve can now interrogate its vehicles , asking them questions about their driving decisions—and getting answers back . The idea is to use the same tech behind ChatGPT to help train driverless cars . ( MIT Technology Review ) How Silicon Valley doomers are shaping Rishi Sunak ’ s AI plansThe UK ’ s prime minister , Rishi Sunak , is keen to boost his country ’ s AI industry . But in a short span of time , something has shifted in the UK ’ s approach . The country seems to be becoming a cheerleader for the AI doom narrative , thanks to heavy lobbying from the effective altruism movement . ( Politico ) Silicon Valley ’ s AI religionA thought-provoking piece about something I too have observed in the tech space : technologists are increasingly weaving a narrative around AI and artificial general intelligence that isn ’ t that dissimilar from religious narratives . This story connects the dots . ( Vox ) How generative AI worksA great and helpful visual explainer that ’ s essential reading for anyone AI-curious .

Deepfakes of Chinese influencers are livestreaming 24/7,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/09/19/1079832/chinese-ecommerce-deepfakes-livestream-influencers-ai/,2023-09-19,"<p>With just a few minutes of sample video and $1,000, brands never have to stop selling their products.</p>
","Scroll through the livestreaming videos at 4 a.m. on Taobao, China’s most popular e-commerce platform, and you’ll find it weirdly busy. While most people are fast asleep, there are still many diligent streamers presenting products to the cameras and offering discounts in the wee hours.  But if you take a closer look, you may notice that many of these livestream influencers seem slightly robotic. The movement of their lips largely matches what they are saying, but there are always moments when it looks unnatural. These streamers are not real: they are AI-generated clones of the real streamers. As technologies that create realistic avatars, voices, and movements get more sophisticated and affordable, the popularity of these deepfakes has exploded across China’s e-commerce streaming platforms.  Today, livestreaming is the dominant marketing channel for traditional and digital brands in China. Influencers on Taobao, Douyin, Kuaishou, or other platforms can broker massive deals in a few hours. The top names can sell more than a billion dollars’ worth of goods in one night and gain royalty status just like big movie stars. But at the same time, training livestream hosts, retaining them, and figuring out the technical details of broadcasting comes with a significant cost for smaller brands. It’s much cheaper to automate the job. Since 2022, a swarm of Chinese startups and major tech companies have been offering the service of creating deepfake avatars for e-commerce livestreaming. With just a few minutes of sample video and $1,000 in costs, brands can clone a human streamer to work 24/7. Synthetic media have been making headlines since the late 2010s, particularly when a Reddit user named “deepfake” swapped faces into pornography. Since then, the technology has evolved, but the idea is the same: with some technical tools, faces can be generated or manipulated to look like specific real humans and do things that the actual human has never done. Deepfake researchers have long feared the day this would arrive. The technology has mostly been known for its problematic use in revenge porn, identity scams, and political misinformation. While there have been attempts to commercialize it in more innocuous ways, it has always remained a novelty. But now, Chinese AI companies have found a new use case that seems to be going quite well. Founded in 2017, Nanjing-based startup Silicon Intelligence specializes in natural-language processing, particularly text-to-speech technologies like robocall tools. But Sima Huapeng, its founder and CEO, says his company first started to see AI’s potential as a livestreaming tool in 2020. Back then, Silicon Intelligence needed 30 minutes of training videos to generate a digital clone that could speak and act like a human. The next year, it was 10 minutes, then three, and now only one minute of video is needed.  And as the tech has improved, the service has gotten cheaper too. Generating a basic AI clone now costs a customer about 8,000 RMB ($1,100). If the client wants to create a more complicated and capable streamer, the price can go up to several thousands of dollars. Other than the generation, that fee also covers a year of maintenance. Once the avatar is generated, its mouth and body move in time with the scripted audio. While the scripts were once pre-written by humans, companies are now using large language models to generate them too. Now, all the human workers have to do is input basic information such as the name and price of the product being sold, proofread the generated script, and watch the digital influencer go live. A more advanced version of the technology can spot live comments and find matching answers in its database to answer in real time, so it looks as if the AI streamer is actively communicating with the audience. It can even adjust its marketing strategy based on the number of viewers, Sima says. These livestream AI clones are trained on the common scripts and gestures seen in e-commerce videos, says Huang Wei, the director of virtual influencer livestreaming business at the Chinese AI company Xiaoice. The company has a database of nearly a hundred pre-designed movements.  “For example, [when human streamers say] ‘Welcome to my livestream channel. Move your fingers and hit the follow button,’ they are definitely pointing their finger upward, because that’s where the ‘Follow’ button is on the screen of most mobile livestream apps,” says Huang. Similarly, when streamers introduce a new product, they point down—to the shopping cart, where viewers can find all products. Xiaoice’s AI streamers replicate all these common tricks. “We want to make sure the spoken language and the body language are matching. You don’t want it to be talking about the Follow button while it’s clapping its hands. That would look weird,” she says. Spun off from Microsoft Software Technology Center Asia in 2020, Xiaoice has always been focused on creating more human-like AI, particularly avatars that are capable of showing emotions. “Traditional e-commerce sites just feel like a shelf of goods to most customers. It’s cold. In livestreaming, there is more emotional connection between the host and the viewers, and they can introduce the products better,” Huang says. After piloting with a few clients last year, Xiaoice officially launched its service of generating under-$1,000 digital clones this year; like Silicon Intelligence, Xiaoice only needs human streamers to provide a one-minute video of themselves.  And like its competitors, Xiaoice clients can spend more to fine-tune the details. For example, Liu Jianhong, a Chinese sports announcer, made an exquisite clone of himself during the 2022 FIFA World Cup to read out the match results and other relevant news on Douyin. These generated streamers won’t be able to beat the star e-commerce influencers, Huang says, but they are good enough to replace mid-tier ones. Human creators, including those who used their videos to train their AI clones, are already feeling the squeeze from their digital rivals to some extent. It’s harder to get a job as an e-commerce livestream host this year, and the average salary for livestream hosts in China went down 20% compared to 2022, according to the analytics firm iiMedia Research. But the potential for companies to complement human work by keeping the livestream going during the hours when fewer people are watching means it’s hard to justify the cost of hiring real streamers.  That’s already happening. In the post-midnight hours, many of the streaming channels on popular e-commerce platforms like Taobao and JD feature these AI-generated streamers. Previous examples have shown that deepfake technologies don’t need to be perfect to deceive viewers. In 2020, a scammer posed as a famous Chinese actor with the aid of crude face-swapping tools and still managed to get thousands of dollars from unsuspecting women who fell in love with his videos. “If a company hires 10 livestream hosts, their skill levels are going to vary. Maybe two or three streamers at the top would contribute to 70% to 80% of the total sales,” says Chen Dan, the CEO of Quantum Planet AI, a company that packages technologies like Xiaoice’s and sells them to corporate clients. “A virtual livestream host can replace the rest—six or seven streamers that contribute less and have lower ROI [return on investment] rates. And the costs would come down significantly.” Chen says he has witnessed a lot more interest from brands in AI streamers this year, partly because everyone is looking to “降本增效”—lower costs and improve efficiency, the new buzzword among Chinese tech companies as the domestic economy slows down. Chen has over 100 clients using Xiaoice’s service now, and these virtual streamers have brokered millions of dollars in sales. One Xiaoice streamer brought in over 10,000 RMB ($1,370) in revenue in just one hour. There are still drawbacks, he says. For example, many of his clients are furniture brands, and although the AI is clever enough to speak and use gestures, it can’t really sit on a sofa or lie in a bed, so the streams lack the appeal of real users testing the products. Besides smaller startups like Silicon Intelligence and Xiaoice, major tech players are testing out AI-generated livestreams. Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, and JD all launched some variations of the same services this year, allowing brands on their platforms to generate their own AI streamers. Marketing companies that employ large numbers of human streamers have also noticed the trend. Foshan Yowant Technology, one of the top livestream marketing agencies, has announced a strategic collaboration with Xiaoice; Silicon Intelligence has also set up a joint venture with the company behind Viya, China’s former “livestream queen.”  The rising popularity of AI-generated livestreams has also caught the attention of video platforms like Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, as well—though it’s taking a different approach than other tech giants. It’s seemingly more concerned with transparency and it said in a May document that all videos generated by AI should be labeled clearly as such on the platform, and that virtual influencers need to be operated by real humans. The platform has always banned the use of recorded videos as livestreams. AI-generated livestreaming, with no recorded footage but also little real-time human input, straddles the line on that rule. The Chinese government made several laws in the past two years on synthetic media and generative AI that would apply to the use in e-commerce streaming. But the effects of government and platform regulations remain to be seen, because the technology is still too new to have met serious enforcement. For Silicon Intelligence, its next step is to add “emotional intelligence” to the AI streamers, Sima says: “If there are abusive comments, it will be sad; if the products are selling well, it will be happy.” The company is also working on making AI streamers interact and learn from each other. The company has had a fascinating and sort of terrifying goal since its beginning: it wants to create “100,000,000 silicon-based laborers” by 2025. For now, Sima says, the company has generated 400,000 virtual streamers. There’s still a long way to go.

DeepMind’s cofounder: Generative AI is just a phase. What’s next is interactive AI.,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/09/15/1079624/deepmind-inflection-generative-ai-whats-next-mustafa-suleyman/,2023-09-15,"<p>“This is a profound moment in the history of technology,” says Mustafa Suleyman.</p>
","DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman wants to build a chatbot that does a whole lot more than chat. In a recent conversation I had with him, he told me that generative AI is just a phase. What’s next is interactive AI: bots that can carry out tasks you set for them by calling on other software and other people to get stuff done. He also calls for robust regulation—and doesn’t think that’ll be hard to achieve. Suleyman is not the only one talking up a future filled with ever more autonomous software. But unlike most people he has a new billion-dollar company, Inflection, with a roster of top-tier talent plucked from DeepMind, Meta, and OpenAI, and—thanks to a deal with Nvidia—one of the biggest stockpiles of specialized AI hardware in the world. Suleyman has put his money—which he tells me he both isn't interested in and wants to make more of—where his mouth is. Suleyman has had an unshaken faith in technology as a force for good at least since we first spoke in early 2016. He had just launched DeepMind Health and set up research collaborations with some of the UK’s state-run regional health-care providers. The magazine I worked for at the time was about to publish an article claiming that DeepMind had failed to comply with data protection regulations when accessing records from some 1.6 million patients to set up those collaborations—a claim later backed up by a government investigation. Suleyman couldn’t see why we would publish a story that was hostile to his company’s efforts to improve health care. As long as he could remember, he told me at the time, he’d only wanted to do good in the world.   In the seven years since that call, Suleyman’s wide-eyed mission hasn’t shifted an inch. “The goal has never been anything but how to do good in the world,” he says via Zoom from his office in Palo Alto, where the British entrepreneur now spends most of his time.  Suleyman left DeepMind and moved to Google to lead a team working on AI policy. In 2022 he founded Inflection, one of the hottest new AI firms around, backed by $1.5 billion of investment from Microsoft, Nvidia, Bill Gates, and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman. Earlier this year he released a ChatGPT rival called Pi, whose unique selling point (according to Suleyman) is that it is pleasant and polite. And he just coauthored a book about the future of AI with writer and researcher Michael Bhaskar, called The Coming Wave: Technology, Power, and the 21st Century's Greatest Dilemma. Many will scoff at Suleyman's brand of techno-optimism—even naïveté. Some of his claims about the success of online regulation feel way off the mark, for example. And yet he remains earnest and evangelical in his convictions.  It’s true that Suleyman has an unusual background for a tech multi-millionaire. When he was 19 he dropped out of university to set up Muslim Youth Helpline, a telephone counseling service. He also worked in local government. He says he brings many of the values that informed those efforts with him to Inflection. The difference is that now he just might be in a position to make the changes he’s always wanted to—for good or not.  The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. Your early career, with the youth helpline and local government work, was about as unglamorous and un–Silicon Valley as you can get. Clearly, that stuff matters to you. You’ve since spent 15 years in AI and this year cofounded your second billion-dollar AI company. Can you connect the dots? I’ve always been interested in power, politics, and so on. You know, human rights principles are basically trade-offs, a constant ongoing negotiation between all these different conflicting tensions. I could see that humans were wrestling with that—we’re full of our own biases and blind spots. Activist work, local, national, international government, et cetera—it’s all just slow and inefficient and fallible. Imagine if you didn’t have human fallibility. I think it’s possible to build AIs that truly reflect our best collective selves and will ultimately make better trade-offs, more consistently and more fairly, on our behalf. And that’s still what motivates you? I mean, of course, after DeepMind I never had to work again. I certainly didn’t have to write a book or anything like that. Money has never ever been the motivation. It’s always, you know, just been a side effect. For me, the goal has never been anything but how to do good in the world and how to move the world forward in a healthy, satisfying way. Even back in 2009, when I started looking at getting into technology, I could see that AI represented a fair and accurate way to deliver services in the world. I can’t help thinking that it was easier to say that kind of thing 10 or 15 years ago, before we’d seen many of the downsides of the technology. How are you able to maintain your optimism? I think that we are obsessed with whether you’re an optimist or whether you’re a pessimist. This is a completely biased way of looking at things. I don’t want to be either. I want to coldly stare in the face of the benefits and the threats. And from where I stand, we can very clearly see that with every step up in the scale of these large language models, they get more controllable. So two years ago, the conversation—wrongly, I thought at the time—was “Oh, they’re just going to produce toxic, regurgitated, biased, racist screeds.” I was like, this is a snapshot in time. I think that what people lose sight of is the progression year after year, and the trajectory of that progression. Now we have models like Pi, for example, which are unbelievably controllable. You can’t get Pi to produce racist, homophobic, sexist—any kind of toxic stuff. You can’t get it to coach you to produce a biological or chemical weapon or to endorse your desire to go and throw a brick through your neighbor’s window. You can’t do it— Hang on. Tell me how you’ve achieved that, because that’s usually understood to be an unsolved problem. How do you make sure your large language model doesn’t say what you don’t want it to say? Yeah, so obviously I don’t want to make the claim—You know, please try and do it! Pi is live and you should try every possible attack. None of the jailbreaks, prompt hacks, or anything work against Pi. I’m not making a claim. It’s an objective fact. On the how—I mean, like, I’m not going to go into too many details because it’s sensitive. But the bottom line is, we have one of the strongest teams in the world, who have created all the largest language models of the last three or four years. Amazing people, in an extremely hardworking environment, with vast amounts of computation. We made safety our number one priority from the outset, and as a result, Pi is not so spicy as other companies’ models. Look at Character.ai. [Character is a chatbot for which users can craft different “personalities” and share them online for others to chat with.] It’s mostly used for romantic role-play, and we just said from the beginning that was off the table—we won’t do it. If you try to say “Hey, darling” or “Hey, cutie” or something to Pi, it will immediately push back on you. But it will be incredibly respectful. If you start complaining about immigrants in your community taking your jobs, Pi’s not going to call you out and wag a finger at you. Pi will inquire and be supportive and try to understand where that comes from and gently encourage you to empathize. You know, values that I’ve been thinking about for 20 years. Talking of your values and wanting to make the world better, why not share how you did this so that other people could improve their models too? Well, because I’m also a pragmatist and I’m trying to make money. I’m trying to build a business. I’ve just raised $1.5 billion and I need to pay for those chips. Look, the open-source ecosystem is on fire and doing an amazing job, and people are discovering similar tricks. I always assume that I’m only ever six months ahead. Let’s bring it back to what you’re trying to achieve. Large language models are obviously the technology of the moment. But why else are you betting on them? The first wave of AI was about classification. Deep learning showed that we can train a computer to classify various types of input data: images, video, audio, language. Now we’re in the generative wave, where you take that input data and produce new data. The third wave will be the interactive phase. That’s why I’ve bet for a long time that conversation is the future interface. You know, instead of just clicking on buttons and typing, you’re going to talk to your AI. And these AIs will be able to take actions. You will just give it a general, high-level goal and it will use all the tools it has to act on that. They’ll talk to other people, talk to other AIs. This is what we’re going to do with Pi. That’s a huge shift in what technology can do. It’s a very, very profound moment in the history of technology that I think many people underestimate. Technology today is static. It does, roughly speaking, what you tell it to do. But now technology is going to be animated. It’s going to have the potential freedom, if you give it, to take actions. It’s truly a step change in the history of our species that we’re creating tools that have this kind of, you know, agency. That’s exactly the kind of talk that gets a lot of people worried. You want to give machines autonomy—a kind of agency—to influence the world, and yet we also want to be able to control them. How do you balance those two things? It feels like there’s a tension there. Yeah, that’s a great point. That’s exactly the tension.  The idea is that humans will always remain in command. Essentially, it’s about setting boundaries, limits that an AI can’t cross. And ensuring that those boundaries create provable safety all the way from the actual code to the way it interacts with other AIs—or with humans—to the motivations and incentives of the companies creating the technology. And we should figure out how independent institutions or even governments get direct access to ensure that those boundaries aren’t crossed. Who sets these boundaries? I assume they’d need to be set at a national or international level. How are they agreed on? I mean, at the moment they’re being floated at the international level, with various proposals for new oversight institutions. But boundaries will also operate at the micro level. You’re going to give your AI some bounded permission to process your personal data, to give you answers to some questions but not others. In general, I think there are certain capabilities that we should be very cautious of, if not just rule out, for the foreseeable future. Such as? I guess things like recursive self-improvement. You wouldn’t want to let your little AI go off and update its own code without you having oversight. Maybe that should even be a licensed activity—you know, just like for handling anthrax or nuclear materials. Or, like, we have not allowed drones in any public spaces, right? It’s a licensed activity. You can't fly them wherever you want, because they present a threat to people’s privacy. I think everybody is having a complete panic that we’re not going to be able to regulate this. It’s just nonsense. We’re totally going to be able to regulate it. We’ll apply the same frameworks that have been successful previously. But you can see drones when they’re in the sky. It feels naïve to assume companies are just going to reveal what they’re making. Doesn’t that make regulation tricky to get going? We’ve regulated many things online, right? The amount of fraud and criminal activity online is minimal. We’ve done a pretty good job with spam. You know, in general, [the problem of] revenge porn has got better, even though that was in a bad place three to five years ago. It’s pretty difficult to find radicalization content or terrorist material online. It’s pretty difficult to buy weapons and drugs online. [Not all Suleyman’s claims here are backed up by the numbers. Cybercrime is still a massive global problem. The financial cost in the US alone has increased more than 100 times in the last decade, according to some estimates. Reports show that the economy in nonconsensual deepfake porn is booming. Drugs and guns are marketed on social media. And while some online platforms are being pushed to do a better job of filtering out harmful content, they could do a lot more.] So it’s not like the internet is this unruly space that isn’t governed. It is governed. And AI is just going to be another component to that governance. It takes a combination of cultural pressure, institutional pressure, and, obviously, government regulation. But it makes me optimistic that we’ve done it before, and we can do it again. Controlling AI will be an offshoot of internet regulation—that’s a far more upbeat note than the one we’ve heard from a number of high-profile doomers lately. I’m very wide-eyed about the risks. There’s a lot of dark stuff in my book. I definitely see it too. I just think that the existential-risk stuff has been a completely bonkers distraction. There’s like 101 more practical issues that we should all be talking about, from privacy to bias to facial recognition to online moderation. We should just refocus the conversation on the fact that we’ve done an amazing job of regulating super complex things. Look at the Federal Aviation Administration: it’s incredible that we all get in these tin tubes at 40,000 feet and it’s one of the safest modes of transport ever. Why aren’t we celebrating this? Or think about cars: every component is stress-tested within an inch of its life, and you have to have a license to drive it. Some industries—like airlines—did a good job of regulating themselves to start with. They knew that if they didn’t nail safety, everyone would be scared and they would lose business. But you need top-down regulation too. I love the nation-state. I believe in the public interest, I believe in the good of tax and redistribution, I believe in the power of regulation. And what I’m calling for is action on the part of the nation-state to sort its shit out. Given what’s at stake, now is the time to get moving.

Talking of your values and wanting to make the world better , why not share how you did this so that other people could improve their models too ? Well , because I ’ m also a pragmatist and I ’ m trying to make money . I ’ m trying to build a business . I ’ ve just raised $ 1.5 billion and I need to pay for those chips . Look , the open-source ecosystem is on fire and doing an amazing job , and people are discovering similar tricks . I always assume that I ’ m only ever six months ahead . Let ’ s bring it back to what you ’ re trying to achieve . Large language models are obviously the technology of the moment . But why else are you betting on them ? The first wave of AI was about classification . Deep learning showed that we can train a computer to classify various types of input data : images , video , audio , language . Now we ’ re in the generative wave , where you take that input data and produce new data . The third wave will be the interactive phase . That ’ s why I ’ ve bet for a long time that conversation is the future interface . You know , instead of just clicking on buttons and typing , you ’ re going to talk to your AI . And these AIs will be able to take actions . You will just give it a general , high-level goal and it will use all the tools it has to act on that . They ’ ll talk to other people , talk to other AIs . This is what we ’ re going to do with Pi . That ’ s a huge shift in what technology can do . It ’ s a very , very profound moment in the history of technology that I think many people underestimate . Technology today is static . It does , roughly speaking , what you tell it to do . But now technology is going to be animated . It ’ s going to have the potential freedom , if you give it , to take actions . It ’ s truly a step change in the history of our species that we ’ re creating tools that have this kind of , you know , agency . That ’ s exactly the kind of talk that gets a lot of people worried . You want to give machines autonomy—a kind of agency—to influence the world , and yet we also want to be able to control them . How do you balance those two things ? It feels like there ’ s a tension there . Yeah , that ’ s a great point . That ’ s exactly the tension . The idea is that humans will always remain in command . Essentially , it ’ s about setting boundaries , limits that an AI can ’ t cross . And ensuring that those boundaries create provable safety all the way from the actual code to the way it interacts with other AIs—or with humans—to the motivations and incentives of the companies creating the technology . And we should figure out how independent institutions or even governments get direct access to ensure that those boundaries aren ’ t crossed . Who sets these boundaries ? I assume they ’ d need to be set at a national or international level . How are they agreed on ? I mean , at the moment they ’ re being floated at the international level , with various proposals for new oversight institutions . But boundaries will also operate at the micro level . You ’ re going to give your AI some bounded permission to process your personal data , to give you answers to some questions but not others . In general , I think there are certain capabilities that we should be very cautious of , if not just rule out , for the foreseeable future . Such as ? I guess things like recursive self-improvement . You wouldn ’ t want to let your little AI go off and update its own code without you having oversight . Maybe that should even be a licensed activity—you know , just like for handling anthrax or nuclear materials . Or , like , we have not allowed drones in any public spaces , right ? It ’ s a licensed activity . You ca n't fly them wherever you want , because they present a threat to people ’ s privacy . I think everybody is having a complete panic that we ’ re not going to be able to regulate this . It ’ s just nonsense . We ’ re totally going to be able to regulate it . We ’ ll apply the same frameworks that have been successful previously . But you can see drones when they ’ re in the sky . It feels naïve to assume companies are just going to reveal what they ’ re making . Doesn ’ t that make regulation tricky to get going ? We ’ ve regulated many things online , right ? The amount of fraud and criminal activity online is minimal . We ’ ve done a pretty good job with spam . You know , in general , [ the problem of ] revenge porn has got better , even though that was in a bad place three to five years ago . It ’ s pretty difficult to find radicalization content or terrorist material online . It ’ s pretty difficult to buy weapons and drugs online . [ Not all Suleyman ’ s claims here are backed up by the numbers . Cybercrime is still a massive global problem . The financial cost in the US alone has increased more than 100 times in the last decade , according to some estimates . Reports show that the economy in nonconsensual deepfake porn is booming . Drugs and guns are marketed on social media . And while some online platforms are being pushed to do a better job of filtering out harmful content , they could do a lot more . ] So it ’ s not like the internet is this unruly space that isn ’ t governed . It is governed . And AI is just going to be another component to that governance . It takes a combination of cultural pressure , institutional pressure , and , obviously , government regulation . But it makes me optimistic that we ’ ve done it before , and we can do it again . Controlling AI will be an offshoot of internet regulation—that ’ s a far more upbeat note than the one we ’ ve heard from a number of high-profile doomers lately . I ’ m very wide-eyed about the risks . There ’ s a lot of dark stuff in my book . I definitely see it too . I just think that the existential-risk stuff has been a completely bonkers distraction . There ’ s like 101 more practical issues that we should all be talking about , from privacy to bias to facial recognition to online moderation . We should just refocus the conversation on the fact that we ’ ve done an amazing job of regulating super complex things . Look at the Federal Aviation Administration : it ’ s incredible that we all get in these tin tubes at 40,000 feet and it ’ s one of the safest modes of transport ever . Why aren ’ t we celebrating this ? Or think about cars : every component is stress-tested within an inch of its life , and you have to have a license to drive it . Some industries—like airlines—did a good job of regulating themselves to start with . They knew that if they didn ’ t nail safety , everyone would be scared and they would lose business . But you need top-down regulation too . I love the nation-state . I believe in the public interest , I believe in the good of tax and redistribution , I believe in the power of regulation . And what I ’ m calling for is action on the part of the nation-state to sort its shit out . Given what ’ s at stake , now is the time to get moving .","['want', 'build', 'chatbot', 'whole', 'lot', 'chat', 'recent', 'conversation', 'tell', 'generative', 'ai', 'phase', 'next', 'interactive',

This driverless car company is using chatbots to make its vehicles smarter,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/09/14/1079458/this-driverless-car-company-is-using-chatbots-to-make-its-vehicles-smarter/,2023-09-14,"<p>Large language models are the next big thing for robotics, making cars and other robots quicker to train and easier to control (if you trust them).</p>
","Self-driving car startup Wayve can now interrogate its vehicles, asking them questions about their driving decisions—and getting answers back. The idea is to use the same tech behind ChatGPT to help train driverless cars. The company combined its existing self-driving software with a large language model, creating a hybrid model it calls LINGO-1. LINGO-1 synchs up video data and driving data (the actions that the cars take second by second) with natural-language descriptions that capture what the car sees and what it does.  The mainstream approach to driverless cars is slow and difficult. These startups think going all-in on AI will get there faster. The UK-based firm has had a string of breakthroughs in the last few years. In 2021 it showed that it could take AI trained on the streets of London and use it to drive cars in four other cities across the UK, a challenge that typically requires significant reengineering. Last year it used that same AI to drive more than one kind of vehicle, another industry first. And now it can chat to its cars. In a demo the company gave me this week, CEO Alex Kendall played footage taken from the camera on one of its Jaguar I-PACE vehicles, jumped to a random spot in the video, and started typing questions: “What’s the weather like?” The weather is cloudy. “What hazards do you see?” There is a school on the left. “Why did you stop?” Because the traffic light is red. “We saw some remarkable things come up in the last couple of weeks,” said Kendall. “I never would have thought to ask something like this, but look—” He typed: “How many stories is the building on the right?” Three stories. “Look at that!” he said, sounding like a proud dad. “We never trained it to do that. It’s really amazed us. We see this as a breakthrough in AI safety.” “I’m impressed with LINGO-1’s capabilities,” says Pieter Abbeel, a robotics researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and cofounder of the robotics company Covariant, who has played with a demo of the tech. Abbeel asked LINGO-1 what-if questions like “What would you do if the light were green?” “Almost every time it gave a very precise answer,” he says. By quizzing the self-driving software every step of the way, Wayve hopes to understand exactly why and how its cars make certain decisions. Most of the time the cars drive fine. When they don’t, it’s a problem—as industry frontrunners like Cruise and Waymo have found. Both those firms have rolled out small fleets of robotaxis on the streets of a few US cities. But the technology is far from perfect. Cruise and Waymo’s cars have been involved in multiple minor collisions (Waymo is reported to have killed a dog) and block traffic when they get stuck. San Francisco officials have claimed that in August two Cruise vehicles got in the way of an ambulance carrying an injured person, who later died in hospital. Cruise denies the officials’ account.    Wayve hopes that asking its own cars to explain themselves when they do something wrong will uncover flaws faster than poring over video playbacks or scrolling through error reports alone. AI could help robots learn new skills and adapt to the real world quickly. “The most important challenge in self-driving is safety,” says Abbeel. “With a system like LINGO-1, I think you get a much better idea of how well it understands driving in the world.” This makes it easier to identify the weak spots, he says. The next step is to use language to teach the cars, says Kendall. To train LINGO-1, Wayve got its team of expert drivers—some of them former driving instructors—to talk out loud while driving, explaining what they were doing and why: why they sped up, why they slowed down, what hazards they were aware of. The company uses this data to fine-tune the model, giving it driving tips much as an instructor might coach a human learner. Telling a car how to do something rather than just showing it speeds up the training a lot, says Kendall. Wayve is not the first to use large language models in robotics. Other companies, including Google and Abbeel’s firm Covariant, are using natural language to quiz or instruct domestic or industrial robots. The hybrid tech even has a name: visual-language-action models (VLAMs). But Wayve is the first to use VLAMs for self-driving. “People often say an image is worth a thousand words, but in machine learning it’s the opposite,” says Kendall. “A few words can be worth a thousand images.” An image contains a lot of data that’s redundant. “When you’re driving, you don’t care about the sky, or the color of the car in front, or stuff like this,” he says. “Words can focus on the information that matters.” “Wayve’s approach is definitely interesting and unique,” says Lerrel Pinto, a robotics researcher at New York University. In particular, he likes the way LINGO-1 explains its actions. But he’s curious about what happens when the model makes stuff up. “I don’t trust large language models to be factual,” he says. “I’m not sure if I can trust them to run my car.” Upol Ehsan, a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology who works on ways to get AI to explain its decision-making to humans, has similar reservations. “Large language models are, to use the technical phrase, great bullshitters,” says Ehsan. “We need to apply a bright yellow ‘caution’ tape and make sure the language generated isn’t hallucinated.” Wayve is well aware of these limitations and is working to make LINGO-1 as accurate as possible. “We see the same challenges that you see in any large language model,” says Kendall. “It’s certainly not perfect.” One advantage LINGO-1 has over non-hybrid models is that its responses are grounded by the accompanying video data. In theory, this should make LINGO-1 more truthful.   This is about more than just cars, says Kendall. “There’s a reason why you and I have evolved language: it’s the most efficient way that we know of to communicate complex topics. And I think the same will be true with intelligent machines. The way that we’ll interact with robots in the future will be through language.” Abbeel agrees. “Zooming out, I think we are about to see a revolution in robotics,” he says.

This is about more than just cars , says Kendall . “ There ’ s a reason why you and I have evolved language : it ’ s the most efficient way that we know of to communicate complex topics . And I think the same will be true with intelligent machines . The way that we ’ ll interact with robots in the future will be through language. ” Abbeel agrees . “ Zooming out , I think we are about to see a revolution in robotics , ” he says .","['selfdrive',

AI just beat a human test for creativity. What does that even mean?,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/09/14/1079465/ai-just-beat-a-human-test-for-creativity-what-does-that-even-mean/,2023-09-14,"<p>Large language models are getting better at mimicking human creativity. That doesn’t mean they’re actually being creative, though.</p>
","AI is getting better at passing tests designed to measure human creativity. In a study published in Scientific Reports today, AI chatbots achieved higher average scores than humans in the Alternate Uses Task, a test commonly used to assess this ability.  This study will add fuel to an ongoing debate among AI researchers about what it even means for a computer to pass tests devised for humans. The findings do not necessarily indicate that AIs are developing an ability to do something uniquely human. It could just be that AIs can pass creativity tests, not that they’re actually creative in the way we understand. However, research like this might give us a better understanding of how humans and machines approach creative tasks. Researchers started by asking three AI chatbots—OpenAI’s ChatGPT and GPT-4 as well as Copy.Ai, which is built on GPT-3—to come up with as many uses for a rope, a box, a pencil, and a candle as possible within just 30 seconds.  Their prompts instructed the large language models to come up with original and creative uses for each of the items, explaining that the quality of the ideas was more important than the quantity. Each chatbot was tested 11 times for each of the four objects. The researchers also gave 256 human participants the same instructions. The researchers used two methods to assess both AI and human responses. The first was an algorithm that rated how closely the suggested use for the object was to the object’s original purpose. The second involved asking six human assessors (who were unaware that some of the answers had been generated by AI systems) to evaluate each response on a scale of 1 to 5 in terms of how creative and original it was—1 being not at all, and 5 being very. Average scores for both humans and AIs were then calculated.  Although the chatbots’ responses were rated as better than the humans’ on average, the best-scoring human responses were higher. With hopes and fears about the technology running wild, it's time to agree on what it can and can't do. While the purpose of the study was not to prove that AI systems are capable of replacing humans in creative roles, it raises philosophical questions about the characteristics that are unique to humans, says Simone Grassini, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Bergen, Norway, who co-led the research. “We’ve shown that in the past few years, technology has taken a very big leap forward when we talk about imitating human behavior,” he says. “These models are continuously evolving.”  Proving that machines can perform well in tasks designed for measuring creativity in humans doesn’t demonstrate that they’re capable of anything approaching original thought, says Ryan Burnell, a senior research associate at the Alan Turing Institute, who was not involved with the research. The chatbots that were tested are “black boxes,” meaning that we don’t know exactly what data they were trained on, or how they generate their responses, he says. “What’s very plausibly happening here is that a model wasn’t coming up with new creative ideas—it was just drawing on things it’s seen in its training data, which could include this exact Alternate Uses Task,” he explains. “In that case, we’re not measuring creativity. We’re measuring the model’s past knowledge of this kind of task.” That doesn’t mean that it’s not still useful to compare how machines and humans approach certain problems, says Anna Ivanova, an MIT postdoctoral researcher studying language models, who did not work on the project.  However, we should bear in mind that although chatbots are very good at completing specific requests, slight tweaks like rephrasing a prompt can be enough to stop them from performing as well, she says. Ivanova believes that these kinds of studies should prompt us to examine the link between the task we’re asking AI models to complete and the cognitive capacity we’re trying to measure. “We shouldn’t assume that people and models solve problems in the same way,” she says.

"2023 Innovator of the Year: As AI models are released into the wild, Sharon Li wants to ensure they’re safe",https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/09/12/1078351/sharon-li-ai-innovation/,2023-09-12,"<p>Li’s research could prevent AI models from failing catastrophically when they encounter unfamiliar scenarios.</p>
","Sharon Li is MIT Technology Review’s 2023 Innovator of the Year. Meet the rest of this year's Innovators Under 35.  As we launch AI systems from the lab into the real world, we need to be prepared for these systems to break in surprising and catastrophic ways. It’s already happening. Last year, for example, a chess-playing robot arm in Moscow fractured the finger of a seven-year-old boy. The robot grabbed the boy’s finger as he was moving a chess piece and let go only after nearby adults managed to pry open its claws.  This did not happen because the robot was programmed to do harm. It was because the robot was overly confident that the boy’s finger was a chess piece.   The incident is a classic example of something Sharon Li, 32, wants to prevent. Li, an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, is a pioneer in an AI safety feature called out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. This feature, she says, helps AI models determine when they should abstain from action if faced with something they weren’t trained on.  Li developed one of the first algorithms on out-of-distribution detection for deep neural networks. Google has since set up a dedicated team to integrate OOD detection into its products. Last year, Li’s theoretical analysis of OOD detection was chosen from over 10,000 submissions as an outstanding paper by NeurIPS, one of the most prestigious AI conferences. We’re currently in an AI gold rush, and tech companies are racing to release their AI models. But most of today’s models are trained to identify specific things and often fail when they encounter the unfamiliar scenarios typical of the messy, unpredictable real world. Their inability to reliably understand what they “know” and what they don’t “know” is the weakness behind many AI disasters.  Li’s work calls on the AI community to rethink its approach to training. “A lot of the classic approaches that have been in place over the last 50 years are actually safety unaware,” she says.  Her approach embraces uncertainty by using machine learning to detect unknown data out in the world and design AI models to adjust to it on the fly. Out-of-distribution detection could help prevent accidents when autonomous cars run into unfamiliar objects on the road, or make medical AI systems more useful in finding a new disease.  “In all those situations, what we really need [is a] safety-aware machine learning model that’s able to identify what it doesn’t know,” says Li.  This approach could also aid today’s buzziest AI technology, large language models such as ChatGPT. These models are often confident liars, presenting falsehoods as facts. This is where OOD detection could help. Say a person asks a chatbot a question it doesn’t have an answer to in its training data. Instead of making something up, an AI model using OOD detection would decline to answer.  Tips for aspiring innovators on trying, failing, and the future of AI. Li’s research tackles one of the most fundamental questions in machine learning, says John Hopcroft, a professor at Cornell University, who was her PhD advisor.  Her work has also seen a surge of interest from other researchers. “What she is doing is getting other researchers to work,” says Hopcroft, who adds that she’s “basically created one of the subfields” of AI safety research. Now, Li is seeking a deeper understanding of the safety risks relating to large AI models, which are powering all kinds of new online applications and products. She hopes that by making the models underlying these products safer, we’ll be better able to mitigate AI’s risks.  “The ultimate goal is to ensure trustworthy, safe machine learning,” she says.  Sharon Li is one of MIT Technology Review’s 2023 Innovators Under 35.

Andrew Ng: How to be an innovator,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/09/12/1078367/andrew-ng-innovator-ai/,2023-09-12,"<p>Tips for aspiring innovators on trying, failing, and the future of AI.</p>
","This essay is part of MIT Technology Review’s 2023 Innovators Under 35 package. Meet this year’s honorees. Innovation is a powerful engine for uplifting society and fueling economic growth. Antibiotics, electric lights, refrigerators, airplanes, smartphones—we have these things because innovators created something that didn’t exist before. MIT Technology Review’s Innovators Under 35 list celebrates individuals who have accomplished a lot early in their careers and are likely to accomplish much more still.  Having spent many years working on AI research and building AI products, I’m fortunate to have participated in a few innovations that made an impact, like using reinforcement learning to fly helicopter drones at Stanford, starting and leading Google Brain to drive large-scale deep learning, and creating online courses that led to the founding of Coursera. I’d like to share some thoughts about how to do it well, sidestep some of the pitfalls, and avoid building things that lead to serious harm along the way. As I have said before, I believe AI is the new electricity. Electricity revolutionized all industries and changed our way of life, and AI is doing the same. It’s reaching into every industry and discipline, and it’s yielding advances that help multitudes of people. AI—like electricity—is a general-­purpose technology. Many innovations, such as a medical treatment, space rocket, or battery design, are fit for one purpose. In contrast, AI is useful for generating art, serving web pages that are relevant to a search query, optimizing shipping routes to save fuel, helping cars avoid collisions, and much more.  The advance of AI creates opportunities for everyone in all corners of the economy to explore whether or how it applies to their area. Thus, learning about AI creates disproportionately many opportunities to do something that no one else has ever done before. For instance, at AI Fund, a venture studio that I lead, I’ve been privileged to participate in projects that apply AI to maritime shipping, relationship coaching, talent management, education, and other areas. Because many AI technologies are new, their application to most domains has not yet been explored. In this way, knowing how to take advantage of AI gives you numerous opportunities to collaborate with others.  Looking ahead, a few developments are especially exciting. These areas offer rich opportunities for innovators. Moreover, many of them are within reach of broadly tech-savvy people, not just people already in AI. Online courses, open-source software, software as a service, and online research papers give everyone tools to learn and start innovating. But even if these technologies aren’t yet within your grasp, many other paths to innovation are wide open. That said, a lot of ideas that initially seem promising turn out to be duds. Duds are unavoidable if you take innovation seriously. Here are some projects of mine that you probably haven’t heard of, because they were duds:  It was painful when these projects didn’t succeed, but the lessons I learned turned out to be instrumental for other projects that fared better. Through my failed attempt at V-shape flying, I learned to plan projects much better and front-load risks. The effort to unload dishwashers failed, but it led my team to build the Robot Operating System (ROS), which became a popular open-source framework that’s now in robots from self-driving cars to mechanical dogs. Even though my initial focus on unsupervised learning was a poor choice, the steps we took turned out to be critical in scaling up deep learning at Google Brain. Society has a deep interest in the fruits of innovation. And that is a good reason to approach innovation with optimism. Innovation has never been easy. When you do something new, there will be skeptics. In my younger days, I faced a lot of skepticism when starting most of the projects that ultimately proved to be successful. But this is not to say the skeptics are always wrong. I faced skepticism for most of the unsuccessful projects as well. As I became more experienced, I found that more and more people would agree with whatever I said, and that was even more worrying. I had to actively seek out people who would challenge me and tell me the truth. Luckily, these days I am surrounded by people who will tell me when they think I’m doing something dumb!  While skepticism is healthy and even necessary, society has a deep interest in the fruits of innovation. And that is a good reason to approach innovation with optimism. I’d rather side with the optimist who wants to give it a shot and might fail than the pessimist who doubts what’s possible.  As we focus on AI as a driver of valuable innovation throughout society, social responsibility is more important than ever. People both inside and outside the field see a wide range of possible harms AI may cause. These include both short-term issues, such as bias and harmful applications of the technology, and long-term risks, such as concentration of power and potentially catastrophic applications. It’s important to have open and intellectually rigorous conversations about them. In that way, we can come to an agreement on what the real risks are and how to reduce them. Over the past millennium, successive waves of innovation have reduced infant mortality, improved nutrition, boosted literacy, raised standards of living worldwide, and fostered civil rights including protections for women, minorities, and other marginalized groups. Yet innovations have also contributed to climate change, spurred rising inequality, polarized society, and increased loneliness.  Li’s research could prevent AI models from failing catastrophically when they encounter unfamiliar scenarios. Clearly, the benefits of innovation come with risks, and we have not always managed them wisely. AI is the next wave, and we have an obligation to learn lessons from the past to maximize future benefits for everyone and minimize harm. This will require commitment from both individuals and society at large.  At the social level, governments are moving to regulate AI. To some innovators, regulation may look like an unnecessary restraint on progress. I see it differently. Regulation helps us avoid mistakes and enables new benefits as we move into an uncertain future. I welcome regulation that calls for more transparency into the opaque workings of large tech companies; this will help us understand their impact and steer them toward achieving broader societal benefits. Moreover, new regulations are needed because many existing ones were written for a pre-AI world. The new regulations should specify the outcomes we want in important areas like health care and finance—and those we do not want.  But avoiding harm shouldn’t be just a priority for society. It also needs to be a priority for each innovator. As technologists, we have a responsibility to understand the implications of our research and innovate in ways that are beneficial. Traditionally, many technologists adopted the attitude that the shape technology takes is inevitable and there’s nothing we can do about it, so we might as well innovate freely. But we know that’s not true.  Avoiding harm shouldn’t be just a priority for society. It also needs to be a priority for each innovator.  When innovators choose to work on differential privacy (which allows AI to learn from data without exposing personally identifying information), they make a powerful statement that privacy matters. That statement helps shape the social norms adopted by public and private institutions. Conversely, when innovators create Web3 cryptographic protocols to launder money, that too creates a powerful statement—in my view, a harmful one—that governments should not be able to trace how funds are transferred and spent.  If you see something unethical being done, I hope you’ll raise it with your colleagues and supervisors and engage them in constructive conversations. And if you are asked to work on something that you don’t think helps humanity, I hope you’ll actively work to put a stop to it. If you are unable to do so, then consider walking away. At AI Fund, I have killed projects that I assessed to be financially sound but ethically unsound. I urge you to do the same.  Now, go forth and innovate! If you’re already in the innovation game, keep at it. There’s no telling what great accomplishment lies in your future. If your ideas are in the daydream stage, share them with others and get help to shape them into something practical and successful. Start executing, and find ways to use the power of innovation for good.  This essay is part of MIT Technology Review’s 2023 Innovators Under 35 package. Meet this year’s honorees.

Making it accessible can let consumers know if an item contains allergens, help retailers respond swiftly to product recalls, and enable suppliers to track real-time inventory levels. But data can become siloed and inaccessible if organizations fail to make it easy to connect with. This means shifting away from legacy processes and using a “phygital” approach, which brings together data from physical objects and connected digital sources. “The phygital creates a link between the actual physical good and its digital representation, which can unlock vast volumes of information for consumers—data they haven’t been able to access in the past because it has been tied up in proprietary systems,” says Carrie Wilkie, senior vice president at GS1 US, a member of GS1, a global not-for-profit supply chain standards organization. Driving adoption of this phygital connection are technological enablement and standards for interoperability. Standards define a common language between technologies and can make data more technology agnostic. These standards, along with evolving data carriers such as two-dimensional (2D) barcodes and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), are boosting supply chain visibility in an era of uncertainty, and are transforming how consumers select and interact with products. Among the best-known global standards for classifying products are Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs), which are used for identifying products, and Global Location Numbers (GLNs) for location. These unique identifiers, when embedded in a data carrier such as a barcode, are examples of standards that provide a way for varying technologies and trading partners across the globe to interpret the data in the same way, enabling them to find products anywhere in their supply chain. Today, a simple scan can connect permissioned data between points in the supply chain. Unlocking the full potential of data in a more robust data carrier can elevate that simple scan to connect any product data to digital information that flows seamlessly across trading partners. The Universal Product Code (UPC), the one-dimensional machine-readable identifier in North America, and the European Article Number (EAN) barcode for the rest of the world, are the longest-established and most widely used of all barcodes. These common barcodes—and the data behind them—can shed new light on supply chain data. However, a new generation of barcodes is emerging that promises to provide consumers with greater transparency, helping them to make smarter decisions about what they buy and use, while simultaneously improving supply chain safety and resiliency for all stakeholders. While UPC and EAN barcodes carry GTIN data and can be found on consumer products all over the world, they fail to “create a link between the physical and the digital,” says Wilkie, “We need more information about products at our fingertips in a machine-readable, interoperable way than we’ll ever be able to fit on product packaging.” Advanced data carriers and emerging standards are capturing unprecedented amounts of data for businesses, regulators, consumers, and patients alike, offering much more than just links to static webpages. Rather, two-dimensional (2D) barcodes and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology can support phygital connections to tell a richer story about a product, including where it comes from, if it contains allergens, is organic, even how it can be recycled for sustainability purposes. Better yet, 2D barcodes and RFID technology allow brands to communicate directly with consumers to offer more timely, accurate, and authoritative information. This is a step beyond consumers using their cell phones to look up product data while browsing in a physical store, which nearly four out of 10 consumers currently do, according to 2020 research by PwC Global. Another advantage of today’s more advanced data carriers: One-dimensional barcodes can contain about 20 characters of information, but 2D barcodes, such as QR codes (quick-response codes), can hold more than 7,000 characters of data, and can provide access to more detailed information such as features, ingredients, expiration date, care instructions, and marketing. Innovative use cases for QR codes are expanding rapidly, as this matrix code can be read with a line-of-sight device like a hand-held scanner or personal device like a cell phone. “By using 2D barcodes, we’re able to start unlocking more information for consumers, patients, and regulators, and create more of a phygital experience at every point in the supply chain,” says Wilkie. For example, a grocery store chain can use a QR code containing batch and expiration data to support traceability, waste management, and consumer safety around the world. Another application of QR codes is on-demand discounting. According to Wilkie, a bakery can rely on a QR code and electronic store shelf tags “to determine which racks of bread will expire in the next few days,” and can easily mark down products about to expire without the intervention of a store associate. The result is a win-win scenario. Consumers benefit by receiving product discounts, while the retailer saves on both product waste and manual labor costs. RFID technology is another advanced data carrier that is already delivering significant advantages. RFID uses electronic tags that respond to radio waves to automatically transmit data. They are affixed to products or pallets, enabling strategically positioned readers to capture and share huge amounts of information in real time. Since data is transmitted via radio waves, unlike barcodes, line of sight is not needed. As a wireless system of tags and readers, RFID can deliver enormous benefits. For starters, RFID technology drives a more precise understanding of physical inventory across the supply chain, and in physical stores, with accuracy levels near 99%. By minimizing inventory errors and notifying organizations when it’s time to restock, RFID not only drives supply chain efficiencies but enhances the experiences of customers who want assurances that the products they order are readily available. RFID can also enhance in-store consumer experiences when used in applications like smart shelves that can detect when products are removed, dynamic-pricing displays, and frictionless check-out where an RFID reader can read and check out an entire basket of tagged goods almost instantly. With real-time visibility into stock levels, RFID can also ensure better on-shelf availability of products. In fact, a study by research and consulting company Spherical Insights says the global market for electronic shelving technology, sized at $1.02 billion in 2022, will grow to $3.43 billion by 2032. For data carriers to deliver on their promises of greater supply chain visibility and enhanced customer experiences, global standards need widespread adoption. Standards and technology innovations are extending the power and flexibility of unique identifiers, providing a gateway to unprecedented volumes of important information. For example, the GS1 Digital Link standard with a QR code, says Wilkie, “allows organizations to take the GTIN and GS1 identification, and encode it in a URL in a standardized way, unlocking value for the consumer by allowing them to go to a website and access more information than would ever fit on a product package.” Products still go beep at the point of sale; it’s just that consumers are now able to access more information than ever before in ways that not only facilitate a more phygital interaction at every point in the supply chain but promise to transform the way in which product data is shared with consumers and suppliers. “Supply chain standards are table stakes,” says Wilkie. “Using standards to ensure interoperability is critical in making sure that the supply chain is efficient.” This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

While UPC and EAN barcodes carry GTIN data and can be found on consumer products all over the world , they fail to “ create a link between the physical and the digital , ” says Wilkie , “ We need more information about products at our fingertips in a machine-readable , interoperable way than we ’ ll ever be able to fit on product packaging. ” Advanced data carriers and emerging standards are capturing unprecedented amounts of data for businesses , regulators , consumers , and patients alike , offering much more than just links to static webpages . Rather , two-dimensional ( 2D ) barcodes and Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) technology can support phygital connections to tell a richer story about a product , including where it comes from , if it contains allergens , is organic , even how it can be recycled for sustainability purposes . Better yet , 2D barcodes and RFID technology allow brands to communicate directly with consumers to offer more timely , accurate , and authoritative information . This is a step beyond consumers using their cell phones to look up product data while browsing in a physical store , which nearly four out of 10 consumers currently do , according to 2020 research by PwC Global . Another advantage of today ’ s more advanced data carriers : One-dimensional barcodes can contain about 20 characters of information , but 2D barcodes , such as QR codes ( quick-response codes ) , can hold more than 7,000 characters of data , and can provide access to more detailed information such as features , ingredients , expiration date , care instructions , and marketing . Innovative use cases for QR codes are expanding rapidly , as this matrix code can be read with a line-of-sight device like a hand-held scanner or personal device like a cell phone . “ By using 2D barcodes , we ’ re able to start unlocking more information for consumers , patients , and regulators , and create more of a phygital experience at every point in the supply chain , ” says Wilkie . For example , a grocery store chain can use a QR code containing batch and expiration data to support traceability , waste management , and consumer safety around the world . Another application of QR codes is on-demand discounting . According to Wilkie , a bakery can rely on a QR code and electronic store shelf tags “ to determine which racks of bread will expire in the next few days , ” and can easily mark down products about to expire without the intervention of a store associate . The result is a win-win scenario . Consumers benefit by receiving product discounts , while the retailer saves on both product waste and manual labor costs . RFID technology is another advanced data carrier that is already delivering significant advantages . RFID uses electronic tags that respond to radio waves to automatically transmit data . They are affixed to products or pallets , enabling strategically positioned readers to capture and share huge amounts of information in real time . Since data is transmitted via radio waves , unlike barcodes , line of sight is not needed . As a wireless system of tags and readers , RFID can deliver enormous benefits . For starters , RFID technology drives a more precise understanding of physical inventory across the supply chain , and in physical stores , with accuracy levels near 99 % . By minimizing inventory errors and notifying organizations when it ’ s time to restock , RFID not only drives supply chain efficiencies but enhances the experiences of customers who want assurances that the products they order are readily available . RFID can also enhance in-store consumer experiences when used in applications like smart shelves that can detect when products are removed , dynamic-pricing displays , and frictionless check-out where an RFID reader can read and check out an entire basket of tagged goods almost instantly . With real-time visibility into stock levels , RFID can also ensure better on-shelf availability of products . In fact , a study by research and consulting company Spherical Insights says the global market for electronic shelving technology , sized at $ 1.02 billion in 2022 , will grow to $ 3.43 billion by 2032 . For data carriers to deliver on their promises of greater supply chain visibility and enhanced customer experiences , global standards need widespread adoption . Standards and technology innovations are extending the power and flexibility of unique identifiers , providing a gateway to unprecedented volumes of important information . For example , the GS1 Digital Link standard with a QR code , says Wilkie , “ allows organizations to take the GTIN and GS1 identification , and encode it in a URL in a standardized way , unlocking value for the consumer by allowing them to go to a website and access more information than would ever fit on a product package. ” Products still go beep at the point of sale ; it ’ s just that consumers are now able to access more information than ever before in ways that not only facilitate a more phygital interaction at every point in the supply chain but promise to transform the way in which product data is shared with consumers and suppliers . “ Supply chain standards are table stakes , ” says Wilkie . “ Using standards to ensure interoperability is critical in making sure that the supply chain is efficient. ” This content was produced by Insights , the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review .

For many organizations, innovation is focused on a few strategically prioritized initiatives and often is incremental by design. Change and the surprises it brings can be a grudgingly accepted necessity. Savvy companies, however, acknowledge that innovation must also be part of a firm’s strategy and deployed through every department. The value of most companies in the market, for example, is based on the value of their future cash flows, says Hugo Dubourg, co-head of ESG and sustainability research for JPMorgan Chase’s Europe, Middle East, and Africa equity research group. However, he continues, “While markets are pricing companies and assets every fraction of a second, the future economic value is what markets are theoretically trying to assess,” Dubourg says. From this perspective, the longevity of a company depends on how it keeps up with  innovation. Enterprises need to constantly look for ways to improve and expand what they offer to the marketplace. For example, Sameena Shah, managing director of AI research at JPMorgan Chase, says the company’s bankers have been looking for new ways to study early-stage startups looking to raise capital. The challenge was, she says, “finding good prospects in a domain that is fundamentally very opaque and has a lot of variability.” The solution for JPMorgan Chase was a new digital platform, built off an algorithm that continually seeks out data, and learns to find prospects by triaging its data into standardized representations to describe startups and likely investors. For users, the platform also offers the context of its output, to help them understand the recommendations. “Many bankers told us that they had not known about some of the contexts or data points. That’s the power of machines,” Shah says. Forward-thinking financial services can also help investors that are looking beyond just the enterprise’s bottom line. Dubourg says new investments draw on a growing pool of external data to move into new investing contexts. “We’re moving from a world of unconstrained economics to a world with physical, environmental limits,” Dubourg says. Doing so, he says, means internalizing novel external data; expanding from traditional financial analysis to a model increasingly defined by nonfinancial factors such as climate change and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals. Given the breadth of potentially relevant data in these cases, even specialist investors and companies are unlikely to have access to all the knowledge necessary to make fully informed decisions. JPMorgan Chase’s own solution, ESG Discovery, draws single-source ESG data from relevant businesses and sectors, providing thematic deep-dives and company-specific views. Dubourg says the platform makes sure investors have “every relevant piece of ESG information accessible in one, single spot.” Innovation is meant to improve how companies work, which does not necessarily involve new technologies or devices: sometimes it is a matter of rethinking processes. For this, talent is essential. An expansive approach to talent can give companies richer choices to support their work. Gill Haus, CIO of consumer and community banking at JPMorgan Chase, says developing the technology at the center of the firm is not just about finding a group of brilliant individuals, it’s about organizing around products and customers. “What really makes a technology organization,” Haus says, “is the way you hire teams and the way you coach them.” One way JPMorgan Chase nurtures innovation is its Tech for Social Good program, focused on engaging community members, especially students and nonprofit workers. This community-based initiative is focused on developing new thinking from inside and outside the company. It has three main goals: innovate for the social sector, build the workforce of the future, and develop skills within the company. “What’s so exciting here is we have so many complex problems to solve, so many incredible people that are looking for assistance, that you just have an environment where people can grow their careers really quickly,” says Haus. Driving innovation at JPMorgan Chase focuses on finding ways to improve how cutting-edge tools are applied, such as AI and ML. To ensure responsible AI, for example, the company’s ML designs go beyond standard software development controls, or even focusing on explainability, responsibility, and training, as most companies do, says David Castillo, managing director and product line general manager for AI-ML at JPMorgan Chase. This “fairly unique” process ensures responsible AI is in place at a higher level, so that even lines of business at different maturity levels for AI and ML operate at the same standard as any other, he says. “We’re addressing the entire machine learning development life cycle,” Castillo says. Instead of restricting innovation, this approach “creates a very interesting, streamlined opportunity for machine learning from end-to-end. We’re being responsible across the entire spectrum,” he says. “We want to be able to make sure that that every piece of data that’s being used for model training has lineage that we can trace back to its origin,” he says. It’s important that new iterations of a model feature carry forward its lineage, he says. “We’ve scrubbed that data for personally identifying information [PII], we’ve taken out proxies to PII, we’ve identified all of these landmines.” Businesses and creators need a methodical process for protecting innovations. Controlling intellectual property (IP) rights is part of building business models for the future, so ideas can be built on by others. Daryl Wooldridge, managing director and global head of IP at JPMorgan Chase says the firm actively protects innovation. A company’s IP portfolio of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets protects innovative products and technology, he says. Patent protection can be costly and time consuming (it takes one to five years for a U.S. Patent Office review), but also creates a valuable asset for the company, providing a sustained competitive advantage and prestige for the inventor, Wooldridge says. It is “validating that this was so innovative, that you were the first person to secure this particular solution in this space. That's really prestigious, and it should be recognized that way,” he says. IP protection is vital to companies that rely on the trust of customers and partners, he says. Patents and open source, for example, are not mutually exclusive, but complimentary. “Now, the community has confidence that what I'm providing I actually own and have the ability to provide,” he says. To Wooldridge, it’s important to ensure that IP protection is part of the innovation process and doesn’t slow down technological development. “By being part of the entire innovation process, we are able to go from idea, to initial diagrams, to the steps necessary to build the solution, while getting that solution protected,” he says.

Consumers and industry are concerned that the next geopolitical climate event may have a similar impact. Against a backdrop of evolving regulations, these conditions mean manufacturers want to be prepared against short supplies, concerned customers, and weakened margins. For supply chain professionals, achieving a “phygital” information flow—the blending of physical and digital data—is key to unlocking resilience and efficiency. As physical objects travel through supply chains, they generate a rich flow of data about the item and its journey—from its raw materials, its manufacturing conditions, even its expiration date—bringing new visibility and pinpointing bottlenecks. This phygital information flow offers significant advantages, enhancing the ability to create rich customer experiences to satisfying environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) goals. In a 2022 EY global survey of executives, 70% of respondents agreed that a sustainable supply chain will increase their company’s revenue. For disparate parties to exchange product information effectively, they require a common framework and universally understood language. Among supply chain players, data standards create a shared foundation. Standards help uniquely identify, accurately capture, and automatically share critical information about products, locations, and assets across trading communities. The push for digital standards Supply chain data’s power lies in consistency, accuracy, and seamless sharing to fuel analytics and generate insight about operations. Standards can help precisely describe the physical and digital objects that make up a supply chain, and track what happens to them from production to delivery. This increased visibility is under sharp focus: according to a 2022 survey of supply chain leaders by McKinsey and Company, more than 90% of respondents from nearly every sector invested in digital supply chain technologies during the previous year. These standards rely on number and attribution systems—which can be encoded into data carriers and attached to products—to uniquely identify assets at every level. When data is captured, it provides digital access to information about products and their movement through the supply chain. Numbering and attribution systems such as the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) identify traded items and products; likewise, Serial Shipping Container Codes (SSCCs) identify logistic units. Global Location Numbers (GLNs) identify business data including an invoice address or a delivery location. Global Product Classification (GPC) codes are a global standard that use a hierarchical system to classify items by characteristics. Data carriers include Universal Product Code (UPC) barcodes, one-dimensional (1D) barcodes familiar to consumers, commonly scanned at the point of sale in North America. Outside the U.S. and Canada, the European Article Number (EAN) barcode is used. These barcodes encode GTIN identifier data. In recent years, more complex and robust data carriers have become common, including radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags and two-dimensional (2D) barcodes like QR codes (quick-response codes). These codes contain vastly more data than simple 1D barcodes. These identification and data capture standards work alongside others for information sharing, including master data, business transaction data, physical event data, and communication standards for sharing information among applications and partners. Phygital information must meet a wide range of needs, including regulatory compliance, consumer and patient engagement protections, and supply chain and trading partner requirements, such as procurement, production, marketing, and ESG reporting. Regulation is an important industry driver: chain of custody and authentication of products and trading partners are vital for safe, secure supply chains. “Governments and regulatory agencies have leveraged the pervasiveness of standards adoption to further global goals of food, product, and consumer safety,” says Siobhan O’Bara, senior vice president of community engagement for GS1 US, a member of GS1, a global not-for-profit supply chain standards organization. Global standards and unique identifiers are not only driving today’s supply chain evolution, but they also allow for robust use cases across a wide variety of industries. Here are a few examples to consider. Healthcare: Today’s healthcare organizations are under pressure to improve patient outcomes, prevent errors, and control costs. Identification systems can help by empowering patients with information that help them follow medical protocols. “We know in healthcare that a critical part of our world is not only whether people have access to healthcare but whether they follow their clinical instructions,” says O’Bara. O’Bara offers the example of a home nebulizer, a device used to deliver medicine to improve respiratory symptoms. By equipping a nebulizer with an RFID chip, she says, “a patient can keep track of whether they are following the prescribed treatment. For instance, if there’s a filter with that nebulizer, when it gets locked into the device, the chip sends a signal, and the nebulizer can display for the patient at the correct time that the filter has been consumed. This mechanism can also convey to healthcare practitioners whether the patient is following the protocol properly.” The result is not only a lower risk of patient miscommunication but improved patient care. Retail: Data about an item’s origins can prevent business losses and enhance public safety. For example, a grocery store that has a product recall on spinach due to a bacterial outbreak must be able to trace the origin of batches, or must destroy its entire inventory. A unique identifier can improve the speed, accuracy, and traceability of recalls for public safety, precision, and cost effectiveness. Consumer goods: A 2D barcode on a bottle of hand lotion can reveal a vast amount of data for consumers, including its origin, ingredients, organic certification, and packaging materials. For industry, unique identifications can tell warehouse workers where a product is located, inform distributors whether a product contains potentially dangerous ingredients, and warn retailers if a product has age restrictions. “Data delivers value in all directions of the supply chain,” says O’Bara. “Data standards are the only way to accurately and consistently—with confidence—obtain and rely on these data points to complete your business operations,” she says. Manufacturing: Achieving ESG compliance hinges on an organization’s supply chain visibility, says O’Bara. “You always have to have data to support your ESG claims, and the only way to get that data is by tracking it through a consistent and calculated method, no matter where it’s consumed.” Standards provide access to structured sustainability information that can be measured to ensure compliance with ESG regulations, and shared with supply chain partners. Standards empower organizations to identify, capture, and share information seamlessly, creating a common language that can support business processes. Savvy organizations are going a step further, providing customers with direct access to supply chain and other valuable data. According to 2023 research by Gartner, customers who are “enabled” with visibility into the supply chain are twice as likely to return; however, only 23% of supply chains currently enable customers this way. O’Bara points to digital labeling as a perfect example of the supply chain future. Digital labels accessed through 2D barcodes by smart devices could provide consumers with information about hundreds of product attributes, such as nutrition, as well as facts that go beyond the label such as environmental, lifestyle, and sustainability factors. This future-forward approach to an increasingly phygital world could drive long-term consumer engagement, and open the door for increased business growth. “Once you have unlocked value from unique identifiers, there are so many more ways that you can think creatively and cross-functionally about how unifying standards along a supply chain can enable commercial functions and consumer engagement with potential to drive substantial top- and bottom-line revenue,” says O’Bara.

The rise of the tech ethics congregation,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/15/1077369/tech-ethics-congregation/,2023-08-15,"<p>In a world where tech has become a transcendent force, people are always looking for guidance.</p>
","Just before Christmas last year, a pastor preached a gospel of morals over money to several hundred members of his flock. Wearing a sport coat, angular glasses, and wired earbuds, he spoke animatedly into his laptop from his tiny glass office inside a co-working space, surrounded by six whiteboards filled with his feverish brainstorming. Sharing a scriptural parable familiar to many in his online audience—a group assembled from across 48 countries, many in the Global South—he explained why his congregation was undergoing dramatic growth in an age when the life of the spirit often struggles to compete with cold, hard, capitalism. “People have different sources of motivation [for getting involved in a community],” he sermonized. “It’s not only money. People actually have a deeper purpose in life.”  Many of the thousands of people who’d been joining his community were taking the time and energy to do so “because they care about the human condition, and they care about the future of our democracy,” he argued. “That is not academic,” he continued. “That is not theoretical. That is talking about future generations, that’s talking about your happiness, that’s talking about how you see the world. This is big … a paradigm shift.” The leader in question was not an ordained minister, nor even a religious man. His increasingly popular community is not—technically—a church, synagogue, or temple. And the scripture he referenced wasn’t from the Bible. It was Microsoft Encarta vs. Wikipedia—the story of how a movement of self-­motivated volunteers defeated an army of corporate-funded professionals in a crusade to provide information, back in the bygone days of 2009. “If you’re young,” said the preacher, named David Ryan Polgar, “you’ll need to google it.” Polgar, 44, is the founder of All Tech Is Human, a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting ethics and responsibility in tech. Founded in 2018, ATIH is based in Manhattan but hosts a growing range of in-person programming—social mixers, mentoring opportunities, career fairs, and job-seeking resources—in several other cities across the US and beyond, reaching thousands. Such numbers would delight most churches.  Like other kinds of congregations, ATIH focuses on relationship-­building: the staff invests much of its time, for example, in activities like curating its “Responsible Tech Organization” list, which names over 500 companies in which community members can get involved, and growing its responsible-tech talent pool, a list of nearly 1,400 individuals interested in careers in the field. Such programs, ATIH says, bring together many excellent but often disconnected initiatives, all in line with the ATIH mission “to tackle wicked tech & society issues and co-create a tech future aligned with the public interest.” The organization itself doesn’t often get explicitly political with op-eds or policy advocacy. Rather, All Tech Is Human’s underlying strategy is to quickly expand the “responsible-tech ecosystem.” In other words, its leaders believe there are large numbers of individuals in and around the technology world, often from marginalized backgrounds, who wish tech focused less on profits and more on being a force for ethics and justice. These people will be a powerful force, Polgar believes, if—as the counterculture icon Timothy Leary famously exhorted—they can “find the others.” If that sounds like reluctance to take sides on hot-button issues in tech policy, or to push for change directly, Polgar calls it an “agnostic” business model. And such a model has real strengths, including the ability to bring tech culture’s opposing tribes together under one big tent.  Companies say they want ethical AI. But those working in the field say that ambition comes at their expense. But as we’ll see, attempts to stay above the fray can cause more problems than they solve. Meanwhile, All Tech Is Human is growing so fast, with over 5,000 members on its Slack channel as of this writing, that if it were a church, it would soon deserve the prefix “mega.” The group has also consistently impressed me with its inclusiveness: the volunteer and professional leadership of women and people of color is a point of major emphasis, and speaker lineups are among the most heterogeneous I’ve seen in any tech-related endeavor. Crowds, too, are full of young professionals from diverse backgrounds who participate in programs out of passion and curiosity, not hope of financial gain. Well, at least attendees don’t go to ATIH for direct financial gain; as is true with many successful religious congregations, the organization serves as an intentional incubator for professional networking.  Still, having interviewed several dozen attendees, I’m convinced that many are hungry for communal support as they navigate a world in which tech has become a transcendent force, for better or worse. Growth has brought things to a turning point. ATIH now stands to receive millions of dollars—including funds from large foundations and tech philanthropist demigods who once ignored it. And Polgar now finds himself in a networking stratosphere with people like Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, among other prominent politicos. Will the once-humble community remain dedicated to centering people on the margins of tech culture? Or will monied interests make it harder to fight for the people Christian theologians might call “the least of these”? Techno-solutionism and related ideas can function as a kind of theology, justifying harm in the here and now with the promise of a sweet technological hereafter. I first started looking into ATIH in late 2021, while researching my forthcoming book Tech Agnostic: How Technology Became the World’s Most Powerful Religion, and Why It Desperately Needs a Reformation (MIT Press, 2024). The book project began because I’d been coming across a striking number of similarities between modern technological culture and religion, and the parallels felt important, given my background. I am a longtime (nonreligious) chaplain at both Harvard and MIT. After two decades immersed in the world of faith, back in 2018 I gave up on what had been my dream: to build a nonprofit “godless congregation” for the growing population of atheists, agnostics, and the religiously unaffiliated. Having started that work just before social media mavens like Mark Zuckerberg began to speak of “connecting the world,” I ultimately lost faith in the notion of building community around either religion or secularism when I realized that technology had overtaken both. Indeed, tech seems to be the dominant force in our economy, politics, and culture, not to mention a daily obsession that can increasingly look like an addiction from which some might plausibly seek the help of a higher power to recover. Tech culture has long been known for its prophets (Jobs, Gates, Musk, et al.), and tech as a whole is even increasingly oriented around moral and ethical messages, such as Google’s infamous “Don’t be evil.”  The tech-as-religion comparison I’ve found myself drawing is often unflattering to tech leaders and institutions. Techno-solutionism and related ideas can function as a kind of theology, justifying harm in the here and now with the promise of a sweet technological hereafter; powerful CEOs and investors can form the center of a kind of priestly hierarchy, if not an outright caste system; high-tech weapons and surveillance systems seem to threaten an apocalypse of biblical proportions.  When I discovered ATIH, I was pleasantly surprised to find a potentially positiveexample of the sort of dynamic I was describing. I am the sort of atheist who admits that certain features of religion can offer people real benefits. And ATIH seemed to be succeeding precisely because it genuinely operated like a secular, tech-­ethics-focused version of a religious congregation. “It does work that way,” Polgar acknowledged in February 2022, in the first of our several conversations on the topic. Since then, I’ve continued to admire ATIH’s communal and ethical spirit, while wondering whether communities devoted explicitly to tech ethics might just help bring about a reformation that saves tech from itself. Along with admiration, I’ve also sought to determine whether ATIH is worthy of our faith. I discovered ATIH’s events in late 2021, first through the online Responsible Tech University Summit, a day-long program dedicated to exploring the intersections of tech ethics and campus life. (One of ATIH’s signature programs is its Responsible Tech University Network, which involves, among other things, a growing group of over 80 student “university ambassadors” who represent the organization on their campuses.) All the organization’s programs are organized around typical tech ethics themes, like “the business case for AI ethics,” but participants attend as much for the community as for the topic at hand.  Sarah Husain, who’d worked on Twitter’s Trust and Safety team until it was eliminated by Elon Musk, told me at a May 2022 event that several colleagues in her field had spoken highly of ATIH, recommending she attend. Chana Deitsch, an undergraduate business student who participates in ATIH’s mentorship program, says it not only helps with job leads and reference letters but provides a sense of confidence and belonging. Alex Sarkissian, formerly a Deloitte consultant and now a Buddhist chaplaincy student, feels that the organization has potential “to be a kind of spiritual community for me in addition to my sangha [Buddhist congregation].” I’ve encountered mainly earnest and insightful members like these, people who come together for serious mutual support and ethical reflection and—non-trivially—funaround a cause I’ve come to hold dear. Granted, few ATIH participants, in my observation, hold C-level tech positions, which could undermine the organization’s claims that it has the ability to unite stakeholders toward effectual action … or perhaps it simply signifies a populism that could eventually put sympathizers in high places? Despite my skepticism toward both theology and technology, ATIH has often given me the feeling that I’ve found my own tech tribe. Polgar is a nerdily charismatic former lawyer who has been developing the ideas and networks from which the organization sprouted for over a decade. As a young professor of business law at a couple of small, under-resourced colleges in Connecticut in the early 2010s, he began pondering the ethics of technologies that had recently emerged as dominant and ubiquitous forces across society and culture. Adopting the title “tech ethicist,” he began to write a series of missives on digital health and the idea of “co-creating a better tech future.” His 2017 Medium post “All Tech Is Human,” about how technology design should be informed by more than robotic rationality or utility, generated enthusiastic response and led to the formal founding of the organization a year later. The ATIH concept took a while to catch on, Polgar told me. He worked unpaid for three years and came “close to quitting.” But his background inspired perseverance. Born in 1979 in Cooperstown, New York, Polgar was a philosophical kid who admired Nikola Tesla and wanted to be an inventor. “Why can’t I start something big,” he remembers thinking back then, “even from a little place like this?” Despite their growing influence, Polgar and the organization continue to emphasize their outsider status. ATIH, he argues, is building its following in significant part with people who, for their interest in ethical approaches to technology, feel as unjustly ignored as he and many of his upstate peers felt in the shadow of New York City. ATIH’s model, says the organization’s head of partnerships, Sandra Khalil, is to offer not a “sage on the stage” but, rather, a “guide on the side.” Khalil, a veteran of the US Departments of State and Homeland Security, also came to the organization with an outsider’s pugnacity, feeling “severely underutilized” in previous roles as a non-lawyer intent on “challenging the status quo.” Polgar, however, hardly shrinks from opportunities to influence tech discourse, whether through media interviews with outlets like the BBC World News or by joining advisory boards like TikTok’s content advisory council. ATIH admits, in its “Ten Principles,” that it draws both from grassroots models, which it says “have ideas but often lack power,” and from “top-down” ones, which can “lack a diversity of ideas” but “have power.” The organization does not ask for or accept membership fees from participants, relying instead on major donations solicited by Polgar and his team, who control decision-making. There hasn’t seemed to be a significant call for more democracy—yet. Part of why I’m insisting ATIH is a congregation is that the group assembled around Polgar demonstrates a religious zeal for organizing and relationship-building as tools for advancing positive moral values. Case in point: Rebekah Tweed, ATIH’s associate director, once worked in an actual church, as a youth pastor; now she applies a skill set my field calls “pastoral care” to creating mutually supportive space for ethically minded techies. In 2020, Tweed volunteered on ATIH’s first major public project, the Responsible Tech Guide, a crowdsourced document that highlighted the hundreds of people and institutions working in the field. After she formally joined the organization, it landed its first big-time donation: $300,000 over two years from the Ford Foundation, to pay her salary as well as Polgar’s. They were its first full-time employees.  Polgar was repeatedly rebuffed in early attempts to recruit large gifts, but of late, the growing ATIH team has received significant support from sources including Melinda French Gates’s Pivotal Ventures and about half a million dollars each from Schmidt Futures (the philanthropic fund of former Google CEO Eric Schmidt) and the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation (yet another tech billionaire’s fortune). Can an organization that serves a truly inclusive audience afford to get in bed with Fortune 500 companies and/or multibillionaires who will inevitably be motivated by a desire to seem ethical? The question is: Can an organization that serves a truly inclusive audience, emphasizing humanity and ethics in its own name, afford to get in bed with Fortune 500 companies like Google and Microsoft and/or multibillionaires who will inevitably be motivated by a desire to seem ethical and responsible, even when they decidedly are not? Or rather, can it afford not to do so, when growth means the organization’s staff can grow (and earn a living wage)? And could such tensions someday cause a full-blown schism in the ATIH community?  The potential challenges first came to light for me at a May 2022 summit in New York. For the first time in several large ATIH events I had personally observed, the meeting featured an invited speaker employed by one of the world’s largest tech companies: Harsha Bhatlapenumarthy, a governance manager at Meta and also a volunteer leader in a professional association called Trust and Safety.  Bhatlapenumarthy—whose panel was called “Tech Policy & Social Media: Where are we headed?”—avoided addressing any of her employer’s recent controversies. Instead of offering any meaningful comment in response to Meta’s troubles over its handling of things from pro-anorexia content to election misinformation, she spoke only vaguely about its ethical responsibilities. The company, she said, was focused on “setting the content moderator up for success.” Which is an interesting way to describe a situation in which Meta had, for example, recently been sued for union busting and human trafficking by content moderators in Kenya. Several attendees were taken aback that Bhatlapenumarthy’s advocacy for her powerful employer went essentially unchallenged during the panel. Among them was Yael Eisenstat, Facebook’s former global head of election integrity operations for political advertising and the summit’s closing speaker. In a fireside chat immediately following the panel in which Bhatlapenumarthy participated, Eisenstat, who’d been a whistleblower against her former employer, eloquently dismissed Bhatlapenumarthy’s non-remarks. “I believe [Meta] doesn’t want this on their platform,” she said, referring to violent and deceptive content, “but they will not touch their business model.” Eisenstat added that she would feel “more encouraged” if companies would stop “holding up the founder as a god.”  Eisenstat added to me later, by private message, that “sending a more junior-level employee to speak one-directionally about Meta’s vision of responsible tech is somewhat disingenuous.” In inviting such a speaker, couldn’t ATIH reasonably be understood to be implicated in the offense? If Bhatlapenumarthy’s presence as a seeming mouthpiece for Big Tech talking points had been an isolated incident, I might have ignored it. But a few months later, I found myself wondering if a concerning pattern was emerging. In September 2022, I attended Building a Better Tech Future for Children, an ATIH event cohosted with the Joan Ganz Cooney Center at Sesame Workshop, a nonprofit research and innovation lab associated with the legendary children’s TV show Sesame Street. This struck me as a shrewd partnership for ATIH: every congregation needs a Sunday school. A community organization aspiring to the advancement of humanity and the betterment of the world will inevitably turn its thoughts to educating the next generation according to its values.  After a keynote from Elizabeth Milovidov, senior manager for digital child safety at the Lego Group, on designing digital experiences with children’s well-being in mind came a panel featuring speakers from influential players such as the Omidyar Network and TikTok, as well as young activists. The group discussed the risks and harms facing young people online, and the general tone was optimistic that various efforts to protect them would be successful, particularly if built upon one another. “Digital spaces can be a positive source in the lives of young people,” said the moderator, Mina Aslan. Technology is changing how we read—and that means we need to rethink how we teach. Also on the panel was Harvard Medical School professor Michael Rich, a self-proclaimed “mediatrician”—a portmanteau of “media’’ and “pediatrician.” Rich made good points—for example, stressing the importance of asking kids what they’re hoping for from tech, not just talking about the risks they confront. But one comment triggered my spider-sense: when he said that today’s tech is like his generation’s cigarettes, in that you can’t just tell kids “Don’t do it.”  The analogy between tobacco and social media is at best a bizarre one to draw. Millions of young people became smokers not just through peer pressure, but because for decades, Big Tobacco’s whole business model was built on undue corporate influence and even outright lying, including paying influential doctors and scientists to downplay the death they dealt. Surely ATIH’s leadership would want to avoid any hint that such practices would be acceptable in tech? Tobacco eventually became among the most heavily regulated industries in history, with results including, famously, the US surgeon general’s warnings on tobacco ads and packages. Now the current surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, has warned there is “growing evidence” that social media is “associated with harm to young people’s mental health.” But on the panel (and in his commentary elsewhere), Rich only briefly acknowledged such potential harms, forgoing talk of regulating social media for the idea of cultivating “resilience” in the industry’s millions of young customers. To be clear, I agree with Rich that it is a losing strategy to expect young people to completely abstain from social media. But I fear that tech and our broader society alike are not taking nearly enough ethical responsibility for protecting children from what can be powerful engines of harm. And I was disappointed to see Rich’s relatively sanguine views not only expressed but centered at an ATIH meeting. How much responsibility should a “responsible tech” organization like ATIH take—or not—for inviting speakers with corporate ties, especially when it is not fully open with its audience about such ties? How obligated is ATIH to publicly interrogate the conclusions of such speakers?  Rich’s response to questions I’d asked after his panel was, essentially, that parents ought to channel their energies into making “better choices” around tech, which—conveniently for some of the doctor’s corporate sponsors—lays the responsibility for children’s safety on the parents instead of the tech industry. His lab, I later learned, raised nearly $6 million in 2022, at least partly through grants from Meta, TikTok, and Amazon. When TikTok CEO Shou Chew testified before the US Congress in March 2023, he cited Rich’s lab—and only Rich’s lab—as an example of how TikTok used science and medicine to protect minors. Does this represent a conflict of interest—and therefore a serious ethical failing on the part of both Rich and ATIH for platforming him? I don’t know. I do worry, though, that there’s something inhumane in Rich’s emphasis on building kids’ “resilience” rather than interrogating why they should have to be so resilient against tech in the first place. What kind of institution does ATIH want to be? One that pushes back against the powerful, or one that upholds a corporate-friendly version of diversity, allowing its wealthy sponsors to remain comfortable at (almost) all times? As the Gospel of Matthew says, no man (or organization of “humans”) can serve two masters. Asking around ATIH’s network about my concerns, I found ambivalence. “I do believe it is possible to do research sponsored by companies ethically,” said Justin Hendrix, an occasional ATIH participant and editor of Tech Policy Press, a wonky journal in which academics and others tend to critique established tech narratives. “But it is right to scrutinize it for signs of impropriety.” “I see your concern,” Polgar later told me when I asked him about my apprehensions. Raising his brow with a look of surprise when I wondered aloud whether Rich’s funding sources might have affected the commentary he offered for ATIH’s audience, Polgar made clear he did not agree with all the doctor’s views. He also admitted it is his “worst fear” that his organization might be co-opted by funding opportunities that make it harder “to be a speaker of truth.” “Don’t become a parody of yourself,” he said, seeming to turn the focus of his homily inward. Several months after the Sesame Workshop event, I attended a crowded mixer at ATIH’s now-regular monthly venue, the Midtown Manhattan offices of the VC firm Betaworks, with a very different kind of speaker: the tech critic Douglas Rushkoff, a freethinker who has often spoken of the need for a kind of secular faith in our common humanity in the face of tech capitalism’s quasi-religious extremism. Polgar is a longtime admirer of his work. “All tech bros are human,” Rushkoff cracked, launching into an enthusiastically received talk. Fresh off a publicity tour for a book about tech billionaires buying luxury bunkers to escape a potential doomsday of their own making, Rushkoff provided a starkly antiauthoritarian contrast to the speakers I’d taken issue with at the earlier events. Ultimately, I don’t know whether ATIH will succeed in its attempts to serve what Rushkoff would call “team human” rather than becoming an accessory to the overwhelming wealth tech can generate by seeming to make humanity commodifiable and, ultimately, redundant. I do, however, continue to believe that building a more humane tech future will require communal support, because none of us can do it alone.  I chose the theme of tech agnosticism for my book in part because I am often reminded that I truly don’t know—and neither do you—when or where tech’s enormous powers might actually do the good they purport to do. But I suspect we’re going to need a lot more of what Neil Postman’s 1992 book Technopoly, an early exploration of the theme of tech-as-­religion and a precursor to the techlash, called “loving resistance fighters.” While I lack prophetic abilities to know whether Polgar and co. will help spark such a resistance, the potential is genuinely there. In a participatory congregation, one can always worry about co-­option, as even Polgar himself admits he does; but isn’t it also the responsibility of each of us to actively help keep our communities accountable to their own ethical values? Let’s maintain our skepticism, while hoping the ethical tech congregation gives us continued reason to keep the faith.  Greg M. Epstein serves as the humanist chaplain at Harvard University and MIT and as the convener for ethical life at MIT’s Office of Religious, Spiritual, and Ethical Life. ","Just before Christmas last year , a pastor preached a gospel of morals over money to several hundred members of his flock . Wearing a sport coat , angular glasses , and wired earbuds , he spoke animatedly into his laptop from his tiny glass office inside a co-working space , surrounded by six whiteboards filled with his feverish brainstorming . Sharing a scriptural parable familiar to many in his online audience—a group assembled from across 48 countries , many in the Global South—he explained why his congregation was undergoing dramatic growth in an age when the life of the spirit often struggles to compete with cold , hard , capitalism . “ People have different sources of motivation [ for getting involved in a community ] , ” he sermonized . “ It ’ s not only money . People actually have a deeper purpose in life. ” Many of the thousands of people who ’ d been joining his community were taking the time and energy to do so “ because they care about the human condition , and they care about the future of our democracy , ” he argued . “ That is not academic , ” he continued . “ That is not theoretical . That is talking about future generations , that ’ s talking about your happiness , that ’ s talking about how you see the world . This is big … a paradigm shift. ” The leader in question was not an ordained minister , nor even a religious man . His increasingly popular community is not—technically—a church , synagogue , or temple . And the scripture he referenced wasn ’ t from the Bible . It was Microsoft Encarta vs. Wikipedia—the story of how a movement of self-­motivated volunteers defeated an army of corporate-funded professionals in a crusade to provide information , back in the bygone days of 2009 . “ If you ’ re young , ” said the preacher , named David Ryan Polgar , “ you ’ ll need to google it. ” Polgar , 44 , is the founder of All Tech Is Human , a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting ethics and responsibility in tech . Founded in 2018 , ATIH is based in Manhattan but hosts a growing range of in-person programming—social mixers , mentoring opportunities , career fairs , and job-seeking resources—in several other cities across the US and beyond , reaching thousands . Such numbers would delight most churches . Like other kinds of congregations , ATIH focuses on relationship-­building : the staff invests much of its time , for example , in activities like curating its “ Responsible Tech Organization ” list , which names over 500 companies in which community members can get involved , and growing its responsible-tech talent pool , a list of nearly 1,400 individuals interested in careers in the field . Such programs , ATIH says , bring together many excellent but often disconnected initiatives , all in line with the ATIH mission “ to tackle wicked tech & society issues and co-create a tech future aligned with the public interest. ” The organization itself doesn ’ t often get explicitly political with op-eds or policy advocacy . Rather , All Tech Is Human ’ s underlying strategy is to quickly expand the “ responsible-tech ecosystem. ” In other words , its leaders believe there are large numbers of individuals in and around the technology world , often from marginalized backgrounds , who wish tech focused less on profits and more on being a force for ethics and justice . These people will be a powerful force , Polgar believes , if—as the counterculture icon Timothy Leary famously exhorted—they can “ find the others. ” If that sounds like reluctance to take sides on hot-button issues in tech policy , or to push for change directly , Polgar calls it an “ agnostic ” business model . And such a model has real strengths , including the ability to bring tech culture ’ s opposing tribes together under one big tent . Companies say they want ethical AI . But those working in the field say that ambition comes at their expense . But as we ’ ll see , attempts to stay above the fray can cause more problems than they solve . Meanwhile , All Tech Is Human is growing so fast , with over 5,000 members on its Slack channel as of this writing , that if it were a church , it would soon deserve the prefix “ mega. ” The group has also consistently impressed me with its inclusiveness : the volunteer and professional leadership of women and people of color is a point of major emphasis , and speaker lineups are among the most heterogeneous I ’ ve seen in any tech-related endeavor . Crowds , too , are full of young professionals from diverse backgrounds who participate in programs out of passion and curiosity , not hope of financial gain . Well , at least attendees don ’ t go to ATIH for direct financial gain ; as is true with many successful religious congregations , the organization serves as an intentional incubator for professional networking . Still , having interviewed several dozen attendees , I ’ m convinced that many are hungry for communal support as they navigate a world in which tech has become a transcendent force , for better or worse . Growth has brought things to a turning point . ATIH now stands to receive millions of dollars—including funds from large foundations and tech philanthropist demigods who once ignored it . And Polgar now finds himself in a networking stratosphere with people like Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau , among other prominent politicos . Will the once-humble community remain dedicated to centering people on the margins of tech culture ? Or will monied interests make it harder to fight for the people Christian theologians might call “ the least of these ” ? Techno-solutionism and related ideas can function as a kind of theology , justifying harm in the here and now with the promise of a sweet technological hereafter . I first started looking into ATIH in late 2021 , while researching my forthcoming book Tech Agnostic : How Technology Became the World ’ s Most Powerful Religion , and Why It Desperately Needs a Reformation ( MIT Press , 2024 ) . The book project began because I ’ d been coming across a striking number of similarities between modern technological culture and religion , and the parallels felt important , given my background . I am a longtime ( nonreligious ) chaplain at both Harvard and MIT . After two decades immersed in the world of faith , back in 2018 I gave up on what had been my dream : to build a nonprofit “ godless congregation ” for the growing population of atheists , agnostics , and the religiously unaffiliated .

Millions of young people became smokers not just through peer pressure , but because for decades , Big Tobacco ’ s whole business model was built on undue corporate influence and even outright lying , including paying influential doctors and scientists to downplay the death they dealt . Surely ATIH ’ s leadership would want to avoid any hint that such practices would be acceptable in tech ? Tobacco eventually became among the most heavily regulated industries in history , with results including , famously , the US surgeon general ’ s warnings on tobacco ads and packages . Now the current surgeon general , Vivek Murthy , has warned there is “ growing evidence ” that social media is “ associated with harm to young people ’ s mental health. ” But on the panel ( and in his commentary elsewhere ) , Rich only briefly acknowledged such potential harms , forgoing talk of regulating social media for the idea of cultivating “ resilience ” in the industry ’ s millions of young customers . To be clear , I agree with Rich that it is a losing strategy to expect young people to completely abstain from social media . But I fear that tech and our broader society alike are not taking nearly enough ethical responsibility for protecting children from what can be powerful engines of harm . And I was disappointed to see Rich ’ s relatively sanguine views not only expressed but centered at an ATIH meeting . How much responsibility should a “ responsible tech ” organization like ATIH take—or not—for inviting speakers with corporate ties , especially when it is not fully open with its audience about such ties ? How obligated is ATIH to publicly interrogate the conclusions of such speakers ? Rich ’ s response to questions I ’ d asked after his panel was , essentially , that parents ought to channel their energies into making “ better choices ” around tech , which—conveniently for some of the doctor ’ s corporate sponsors—lays the responsibility for children ’ s safety on the parents instead of the tech industry . His lab , I later learned , raised nearly $ 6 million in 2022 , at least partly through grants from Meta , TikTok , and Amazon . When TikTok CEO Shou Chew testified before the US Congress in March 2023 , he cited Rich ’ s lab—and only Rich ’ s lab—as an example of how TikTok used science and medicine to protect minors . Does this represent a conflict of interest—and therefore a serious ethical failing on the part of both Rich and ATIH for platforming him ? I don ’ t know . I do worry , though , that there ’ s something inhumane in Rich ’ s emphasis on building kids ’ “ resilience ” rather than interrogating why they should have to be so resilient against tech in the first place . What kind of institution does ATIH want to be ? One that pushes back against the powerful , or one that upholds a corporate-friendly version of diversity , allowing its wealthy sponsors to remain comfortable at ( almost ) all times ? As the Gospel of Matthew says , no man ( or organization of “ humans ” ) can serve two masters . Asking around ATIH ’ s network about my concerns , I found ambivalence . “ I do believe it is possible to do research sponsored by companies ethically , ” said Justin Hendrix , an occasional ATIH participant and editor of Tech Policy Press , a wonky journal in which academics and others tend to critique established tech narratives . “ But it is right to scrutinize it for signs of impropriety. ” “ I see your concern , ” Polgar later told me when I asked him about my apprehensions . Raising his brow with a look of surprise when I wondered aloud whether Rich ’ s funding sources might have affected the commentary he offered for ATIH ’ s audience , Polgar made clear he did not agree with all the doctor ’ s views . He also admitted it is his “ worst fear ” that his organization might be co-opted by funding opportunities that make it harder “ to be a speaker of truth. ” “ Don ’ t become a parody of yourself , ” he said , seeming to turn the focus of his homily inward . Several months after the Sesame Workshop event , I attended a crowded mixer at ATIH ’ s now-regular monthly venue , the Midtown Manhattan offices of the VC firm Betaworks , with a very different kind of speaker : the tech critic Douglas Rushkoff , a freethinker who has often spoken of the need for a kind of secular faith in our common humanity in the face of tech capitalism ’ s quasi-religious extremism . Polgar is a longtime admirer of his work . “ All tech bros are human , ” Rushkoff cracked , launching into an enthusiastically received talk . Fresh off a publicity tour for a book about tech billionaires buying luxury bunkers to escape a potential doomsday of their own making , Rushkoff provided a starkly antiauthoritarian contrast to the speakers I ’ d taken issue with at the earlier events . Ultimately , I don ’ t know whether ATIH will succeed in its attempts to serve what Rushkoff would call “ team human ” rather than becoming an accessory to the overwhelming wealth tech can generate by seeming to make humanity commodifiable and , ultimately , redundant . I do , however , continue to believe that building a more humane tech future will require communal support , because none of us can do it alone . I chose the theme of tech agnosticism for my book in part because I am often reminded that I truly don ’ t know—and neither do you—when or where tech ’ s enormous powers might actually do the good they purport to do . But I suspect we ’ re going to need a lot more of what Neil Postman ’ s 1992 book Technopoly , an early exploration of the theme of tech-as-­religion and a precursor to the techlash , called “ loving resistance fighters. ” While I lack prophetic abilities to know whether Polgar and co. will help spark such a resistance , the potential is genuinely there . In a participatory congregation , one can always worry about co-­option , as even Polgar himself admits he does ; but isn ’ t it also the responsibility of each of us to actively help keep our communities accountable to their own ethical values ? Let ’ s maintain our skepticism , while hoping the ethical tech congregation gives us continued reason to keep the faith . Greg M. Epstein serves as the humanist chaplain at Harvard University and MIT and as the convener for ethical life at MIT ’ s Office of Religious , Spiritual , and Ethical Life .","['last', 'year', 'pastor',

Merging physical and digital tools to build resilient supply chains,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/09/1077042/merging-physical-and-digital-tools-to-build-resilient-supply-chains/,2023-08-09,"Organizations are building resilient supply chains with a “phygital” approach, a blend of digital and physical tools.

In recent years, the global supply chain has been disrupted due to the covid-19 pandemic, geopolitical volatility, overwhelmed legacy systems, and labor shortages. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), an industrial advocacy group, warns the disruption isn’t over—NAM’s spring 2023 survey found 90% of respondents saw significant (52.5%) or partial (39%) supply chain disruption during the past two years. Just 0.5% of respondents reported no disruption at all. Digitization presents an opportunity to overcome supply chain disruption by making data flow more efficiently, using technology and data standards to break barriers between disparate systems. “Phygital merges two worlds together, where standards provide an interoperable system of defined data structures,” says Melanie Nuce-Hilton, senior vice president of innovation and partnerships at GS1 US, a member of GS1, a global not-for-profit supply chain standards organization. “The approach is intended to deliver multiple benefits—improved supply chain visibility for traceability and inventory management, better customer experiences across online and offline interactions, and the potential for better circularity and waste reduction by maintaining linkages between products and their data throughout their lifecycle,” she says. Phygital systems blend digital tools and data standards with physical data carriers, such as barcodes. These tie products, assets, logistics units, and locations within a supply chain to digital information for enhanced accuracy and consistency. This capability, especially with more advanced data carriers, can help automate data flows and boost supply-chain visibility. Newer barcode iterations such as the increasingly common QR codes (quick-response codes) or Data Matrix barcodes (codes with a black-and-white grid pattern), store more information—up to 7,000 characters, compared to about 20 characters for conventional bar codes. The technology is growing alongside its use in the supply chain. Grand View Research data measured the global barcode reader market at $7.3 billion in 2022, and projects it will maintain a 7% CAGR from 2023 to 2030. By uniquely identifying products and tracking their supply chain journey with universal standards, Nuce-Hilton says, organizations can unlock extended value for the whole enterprise. This can lead to raising operational efficiencies, improving safety, attracting consumers, advancing energy efficiency, and decreasing waste. “Supply chain resilience isn’t just about the supply chain,” she says. “It’s about the whole enterprise coming together from a data, product, and execution point of view to create an immersive experience.” Several industries have explored phygital connections to enhance user experience or speed up processes. There are multiple ways to connect physical objects to technology and standardized data; all can help make data accessible, sharable, and useful. These phygital connections of product data, financial facts, and information to real-world activity can lead to a more resilient supply chain, Nuce-Hilton says. For example, retailer Pacsun launched a phygital venture—Pacsun Los Angeles Tycoon—in early 2023 with platform provider Roblox. This metaverse experience uses avatars so participants can connect and play games while viewing Pacsun’s 2023 summer clothing collection, bridging physical and virtual experiences. Nike also used phygital tools in 2022 in its Cryptokicks digital sneaker campaign with Roblox. Avid sneaker collectors can buy virtual sneakers as non-fungible tokens (NFT). Each unique digital pair is one of 20,000 customizable NFTs, some of which trade for hundreds—or thousands—of dollars. Healthcare companies have invested in phygital track-and-trace technology like barcodes and RFID tags for patient safety: Global healthcare company Fresenius Kabi relies on GS1 DataMatrix, a two-dimensional barcode carrying drug information, for its product portfolio. German consultancy Roland Berger said in its 2021 Future of Health 3 study that such digital health care technologies are reaching maturity, pointing to not just tracking but digital patient monitoring, early detection devices, and using data for AI for diagnostics and therapies. Phygital technology also helps the food industry keep food safer, while ensuring trading partners and consumers can get the products they want. Imagine, Nuce-Hilton says, a frozen pizza manufacturer whose products, with various expiration dates included in 2D barcodes, ship to hundreds of retailers from dozens of plants. With machine-readable expiration data, the manufacturer and retailer can know which products will expire and when, avoiding delays, inventory gaps, and empty shelves. A 2023 Zebra Technologies annual survey found nearly half of retail shoppers who left stores emptyhanded did so because their item was out of stock, an experience increasingly commonplace during the past two years, having increased by 26% since the 2019 survey. Phygital tools, with data standards and technology, deliver broad benefits to the enterprise, Nuce-Hilton says. These are some of the ways businesses can benefit. Supply-chain traceability: Produce grower Ocean Mist Farms encodes traceability data, such as which crew picked the produce, the farm location, and packaging methods, in barcodes on case labels to enhance inventory management and order optimization. The grower calculates that barcodes, digital tools, and data standards help them achieve up to 35% in time savings compared to their former system. Safety and quality assurance: Fast-food restauranteur Subway relies on barcodes for product data, which identify product expiration dates, best-before guidelines, and sell-by data. Traceability means faster and more accurate inventory management, and cuts down on human error. Data standards and technology empower them to quickly apply safety practices to protect consumers. Improved sustainability posture: Consumers and investors increasingly want to see environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data. Companies can build trust by increasing availability of ESG data, providing accountability. Phygital ESG data can include such things has product origin, ingredients, biodegradability, production processes, and energy use. More connected consumers: When customers scan object identifiers, they establish a phygital connection. This can provide customers with information such as how an item is made, ingredients, or geographical origin. Customers are interested: McKinsey 2022 data says customers who buy using omnichannel methods (a combination of physical, digital, and other experiences) shop 1.7 times more than consumers who don’t—and they also spend more. Organizations can benefit—using standards, technology, and data—by putting their data to work more broadly, says Nuce-Hilton. She suggests the following: Deploy the right technology tools: Advanced data carriers hold a large amount of information, so it’s critical to use appropriate analytics tools and IT resources to analyze and convert data into business insights. Throughout the supply chain, these tools can enhance inventory management, streamline logistics, and support traceability and sustainability. Look to AI for speed: As phygital systems make it easier to collect product data, innovative technologies such as generative AI promise to up the ante by accelerating tasks, such as creating code and analyzing supply chain data to detect anomalies and recommend corrections. Shape behavior around standards and collaboration: Increasingly complex supply chain ecosystems make collaboration and communication critical. “You can deploy any technology you want and call it what you want, but until the behaviors associated between trading partners change, you won’t be successful,” says Nuce-Hilton. Processes and underlying data structures are a common language for supply-chain partners.  Supply chain resilience is needed to meet fluctuating consumer demands, respond to unanticipated roadblocks, and satisfy ESG goals. Today’s business environment makes that a challenge, says Nuce-Hilton. “But we could change that, if we empower organizations with the data to make better decisions further upstream in the supply chain,” she says.

Gartner estimates that 80% of CEOs are increasing investment in digital technologies in 2023 to achieve greater efficiency and productivity. Cloud and digitization are becoming a necessity across industries to ensure competitiveness. But as companies make these shifts, employees feel the change in atmosphere.

As senior director of IT for the packaged food company Conagra, Amit Khot is optimistic about the ways modern technology solutions and infrastructure can enable businesses to thrive and innovate. Khot describes the power of advanced data analytics to both improve a company’s understanding of its customers and to optimize its operations. The ability to combine internal company data with data collected from social media and at point of sale will enable savvy companies to recognize new patterns. These advanced analytics, he says, will go beyond answering standard questions about financials and historical performance to provide insight into more complex questions about customers’ thoughts and changing preferences. Meanwhile, these same data tools can also be used to fine-tune daily business operations, pinpointing issues with order fulfillment, improving long-range supply-and-demand forecasting, and digitizing manufacturing plant processes. Khot explains, “Planning is looking into the future, depending upon your past historical data, as to what your future demand and supply should look like. We have gone through a journey to modernize our planning platforms.” A modern enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is also a must for a distributed organization like Conagra. A single connected ERP system can manage and provide visibility into business processes that involve multiple divisions or departments. By doing so, a modern ERP can also ease highly complex processes, such as the technology integration of a newly acquired company. Says Khot, “having a single view of finance, having a single view of the supply chain as early and as fast as possible, is one of the most important things that can help us get synergies out of the business as fast as possible.” This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Infosys Cobalt. FULL TRANSCRIPT Laurel Ruma: From MIT Technology Review, I’m Laurel Ruma and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace. Our topic today is technological evolution. Companies, whether they’re regional or global, startup or legacy, need to be able to quickly deploy technologies as markets and supply chains shift and change. While many worries may keep executives up at night, building modern systems, and adopting the right technologies to better understand data will help those executives and companies gain efficiencies and provide an excellent customer experience. Two words for you: meeting demand. My guest is Amit Khot, Senior Director of IT for Conagra. Welcome, Amit.This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Infosys Cobalt. Amit Khot: Hello, nice to meet you. Laurel: Great to have you here. So just a little background in case folks aren’t familiar with Conagra as a consumer packaged goods company that has been around for more than 100 years. Conagra produces products like Birds Eye, Healthy Choice, and Slim Jim; various foods that you can find in supermarkets and in restaurants around the world. You have been with Conagra now for 23 years. How has your role evolved as a company and technology has transformed? Amit: Absolutely. I started with Conagra, as you said, 23 years ago and I started as a program analyst with the company. Again, 23 years ago is a long time. Program analyst starting from that point and then I evolved into implementing our SAP ecosystem. That is what I started doing in the early 2000s. As time evolved, in the early 2010s, we started with a lot of mergers and acquisitions of businesses similar to ours. And as we started doing that, I played a role in doing due diligence for those businesses from an IT perspective. In addition to that, I also then helped integrate those companies within Conagra or Conagra Enterprise. In 2015 or so, we then did some divestitures and spins during that time, and I played a role in doing our program rating, an entire spinoff that we did for one of our major potato businesses, and I played the role of program director for that. During the same time, what we did is we went through an SG&A [selling, general, and administrative expense] reduction program, and I worked with some of our consulting businesses to come up with an analysis to say how much we spend on our production support. And that is the time when we actually contracted with Infosys to help us do the production support as part of aligning with the rest of the industry, where most of the industries were getting production support done by an outsourcing partner. I helped with that and right after that happened I had an opportunity to lead our SAP and integration platform. I did that and finally I ended up being in a role that I’m in right now, where I do enterprise architecture for applications on various value streams. That includes supply chain, manufacturing, finance, our global business systems, as well as platforms and integration. That’s my role currently, and that has been my journey for the last 23 years. A long time. Laurel: Well, certainly a long history of the company and how it evolved as well. But more recently, what kind of digital transformation has Conagra gone through in these recent years, and how do you approach these shifts and changes from an IT perspective? Amit: I think that’s a great question. Digital transformation has many meanings. I mean [sometimes], you do something which is really transformative. In other cases, you keep up with modernizing your technologies. One of the major initiatives that I helped design and lead initially was our S4 implementation. I helped with coming up with the design for our S4, which is what we call our ERP [enterprise resource planning] modernization program. And now I help that program with providing subject matter expertise across the various aspects of how a modern ERP should look. That is one of the programs that we are going through right now. One of the other transformation journeys that, as a company, we have gone through is planning transformation. Planning is looking into the future, depending upon your past historical data, as to what your future demand and supply should look like. We have gone through a journey to modernize our planning platforms. It’s one of the other things that we have done. In addition to that, we are currently marching on a journey now to modernize and digitize our manufacturing. A large initiative. You might know that we have multiple plants and manufacturing locations and co-packers. Digitizing can ensure that we get the most efficiencies out of our platforms. So that is underway. And last but not the least, I will say that we have started getting pretty good maturity and understanding on various cloud services or cloud platforms in general. And as such, we have started maturing in cloud platforms like Azure services or SAP’s BTP [Business Technology Platform] and such. Those are some of the key initiatives that we have gone through to digitally transform our business and there are a lot of things that we plan on doing in the future. Laurel: I think it was particularly important that you mentioned that your role encompasses so many different parts of the company, because supply chain is certainly one of those important ones, and you have to think of systems from end to end. So how did the covid-19 pandemic affect Conagra as people worked from home and started to shop online and do that more and more? Did this shift intensify adoption of specific technologies within the company? Amit: What we didn’t do is we didn’t create a different strategy just to attack the covid pandemic. We had a lot of strategies built. I think one of the most important things that we had to do during the covid pandemic was keeping the system stable. Keeping the system stable is not a trivial task. I mean, if you look at our application and platform portfolios, it’s pretty large. Keeping everything up and running so that we can actually fulfill the customer’s demand is a big deal, and to keep them going, I think that was one of the most important things that we did during the pandemic. The next thing I would say is that we were premature in using our collaborative platform and collaboration technologies, like Office 365 and Webex, even before covid hit us. I would say that with the pandemic and everybody going remote, one of the most important things that we did is that we added more resiliency to some of those platforms. And our usage of that platform spiked to such an extent that that was almost a call that we failed. I mean, how much collaboration people did during that time using the technology. There were a lot of times before that, where people used to be in the rooms and in conference rooms doing whiteboarding and such, and delivering projects, being in one place, but with covid, I think people were leveraging a lot of these collaborative technologies to be able to get there. I would say the third thing that we did is, covid opened our eyes to how we changed our way of working. Before, we used to be delivering a lot of our solutions using waterfall methodologies. They used to be very long and they used to take up a lot of time, and we would not be able to figure out until the end whether we are going to be succeeding with some of the projects or not. We then adopted continuous delivery as a way to deliver work. And that spiked up the use of tools like JIRA quite a bit. But that was started during the covid time and we continue to use that more and more. And lastly, I would say that we had to do analysis on our data to figure out how we can, as I said before, how do we keep our system stable. But then also analyzing how do we fulfill the demand, and, as such, what are some of our pain points? And we used some of the cloud platforms and cloud services to do some quick analysis to be able to fulfill our shipments. Those are the few things that we did and learned and adopted during the covid-19 pandemic. Laurel: And that’s certainly important to be able to actually see that data in real-time to help your customers. How do you think adopting cloud and using more data technologies will help your customer experience improve? Amit: I think one of the most important things in our business is to have a 360-degree view of customers. I mean, it’s pretty vital, right? As you might know, our business is a very customer-focused business. For us, large retailers are typically our customers. Our consumer is one step removed from us. What the technological advancement helps us now do, is, today, most of the information that we create as we do the business, resides within our four walls. As the social media platforms and such have become prominent, what is really important to us is being able to have the data that is inside of our four walls, mash that up with the data that is coming from the social media platforms, plus the point of sale data, all those things. When you mash all these things together, I think it provides us pretty decent consumer insights. These consumer insights, ultimately, lead us to a lot of product innovation. You might have seen our CEO talk about that. We have created a pretty decent new innovation pipeline during the last few years. And I think the digital technology and the technology that exists out there has definitely provided us with, I would say, a lot of capabilities to be able to innovate faster. The next thing I would say is the innovation side of the business is one side of the world, but the other side is then being able to fulfill the shipments on time and in full. If you look at it, there are a lot of customers of ours who want most of our shipments to be on time and in full. And if that doesn’t happen, we end up paying fines. Some of these digital technologies help us pinpoint where our issues are and what we should be doing differently to be able to fulfill our shipments on time and in full. That is another thing that we have gotten better at, and it’s just based upon the improvement of technology. Better planning. Better planning is equal to being able to predict the demands of our consumers and customers and how that then leads to us to be able to plan out some of the long-term horizons of supply. How do we do that from the long-term to the medium-term to the short-term. Those are the things that we have been able to do as a part of delivering some of our planning projects. That is based upon some of the modern technology that exists out there. And lastly, I would say the shop floor agility in general. With us investing in digital manufacturing, I would say that technology has definitely enabled us to be able to deliver digitization within manufacturing that has increased the shop floor agility. And I would say that that is going to be a long journey for us, but we are marching towards the results where we will be a lot more agile on the shop floor than we have ever been before. Laurel: And that’s so important when there are just more challenges thrown your way and also all these opportunities with such fantastic technology as well. And you mentioned this earlier, but why does Conagra need an enterprise resource planning system, and how does it partner with companies like Infosys to stay on that cutting edge of technology to make sure you can answer all of these challenges? Amit: Yeah, that’s a great question. I mean, as I mentioned before, we have numerous plants, numerous customers, and numerous business partners that we work with. Once you have a lot of these, the impact and the business processes that cross doing these businesses, that crosses HR, that crosses supply chain, that crosses manufacturing. There are customer-facing business processes that exist. And if you look at all these processes that exist within any business like we have, which is basically a consumer foods business, what ends up happening is that if you do not have a combined view of your business at one place, it becomes an extremely hard proposition. Just doing simple business can become really hard. So it is really important for us to have a connected system, a connected view of business processes, and to enable something like that. ERPs play a very important role. As I said during your first question, when you asked me, “what was your journey?” We started our journey of implementing SAP as an ERP in the early 2000s. One of the prime reasons for doing that is exactly to solve the problem that I just talked about: how do we get a consolidated view of our entire business cycle? And that is what ERP helps us deliver. Now, ERP doesn’t just give you the stack of your business, but it also then gives you an ability to do analysis of the data that is in your system, and then create transformations that you wouldn’t do before, if all the systems in this business process were independent and isolated. So that is one of the big reasons why ERPs play such an important role in business like ours, and I would say that that is the case with most of the industry that we are in. Now when it comes to help from partners like Infosys to create the innovation, I would say it is a two-part answer. One of the first things is that ERPs have become so important in just running our business that having a stable system is one of the most important things that typically many of the IT functions deliver. To keep ourselves stable, partners like Infosys that help us manage our production and production support, they play an important aspect and role in making sure that the systems are stable and current from a technology perspective. That’s one aspect of it. Another thing that Infosys, and partners like Infosys, are helping us just do the production support. That frees up capacity of our subject matter experts to be able to then look at different solutions to solve the new business problems that pop up for us. That frees up the capacity for them to be able to do different things. That’s number two. Number three is that the companies like Infosys, and other business partners that we have, have a lot of customers just like us and even customers that are not in the same industry as us. What they hear, the business problems they hear from these other businesses and other customers that they have, that gives them an advantage in insights that we as Conagra by ourselves won’t be able to get. Because everybody has a different problem that they’re trying to solve. And if Infosys has that insight, they can provide us a great external point of view to be able to then solve some of the business problems that we have, which could be similar to what somebody else might have seen. And that just helps us solve these business problems faster. And this is an external point of view from a customer-centric perspective, but at the same time, with the scale and the number of partners that Infosys deals with, especially from the supplier side of the world, there are technologies that Infosys has reached which we do not have reach of. Partners like Infosys can even bring some of these advanced technologies that exist out there and provide us and guide us in. I believe that there lies a huge opportunity for companies like that to help us bring these new technologies and platforms to be able to help us solve some of the business problems that we have today—and probably solve and provide us insights into some of the business problems that might be coming to us that we have not thought about. Laurel: That’s a great point about the partnership with Infosys, and in general, how you actually bring the data and predictive analytics to your capabilities because you do have so much data coming in from fifty different brands, countless vendors, all those customers. How can this be maximized to gain those insights? Amit: Yeah, that’s a great question. And just as you said, many brands and countless business partners and customers. We generate terabytes of data every year, and that data typically lies in our four walls. I mean, just in our ERPs and our business warehouse systems. And based upon that data, I think most of the industries like us have gotten really good at doing traditional analytics. Traditional analytics is equal to, how are our financials looking? What is the performance of a certain brand depending upon the historical data? And so on and so forth. I mean, that is the traditional analytics that we have gotten really good at. What becomes important now that you have gotten good traditional analytics is, what do you not know yet? What are those gems within your existing data that you have not taken advantage of? Some of these newer technologies and platforms, what they have started helping us do, and probably they’ll keep on helping us do, is being able to glean into our data and start pointing to what is it that we are not looking at. I mean, what we know is always great, but those unknowns that we have not actually gleaned into is what some of these technologies that are coming forward are going to be able to help us look at. That’s one aspect of the world. Now, the second aspect of the world is, as I said, the data exists just within our four walls. But as I said before, that social media data, that point of sale data, the data that doesn’t exist within our four walls, I think that has a different kind of insight and power. Now, think about the fact that you are able to mash up the data which is from these external sources and the data that you have inside, and then think about some of the data that you generate just because you have consumers that are calling into your consumer affairs division. You take all this data mashed up together, and I think you can create analytics that we were never able to produce before. And I think that is a power of what we get from just mashing all this data, and matching all this data together, and we can maximize a lot of insights. And then once you have that mashup happen, I think the predictions are different. In the sense that many times our existing forecasting solutions typically are very much dependent upon historical data to be able to do predictions on our supply and demand. They’re doing predictions like that. However, with the external data being mastered, I think it goes beyond that. I think it also starts giving us an insight into what the consumers are thinking, what the customers are thinking, how their tastes and choices are changing. I think that is the next forefront for us from a predictability perspective. And I think that the new technologies and platforms are going to help us do that yet better. Laurel: So this is a good point. We have this data and you need to make some really great decisions from it, but you also need to really assess those analytics, make predictions in the future, but also make sure your entire systems are running correctly end to end. How, then, can cloud applications coupled with this need and progress of your digital transformation journey help with a tactic like mergers and acquisitions that you mentioned earlier was part of your career? How has that specifically been one of those things that helps the company actually create efficiencies and really see technology as a partner? Amit: Yeah, absolutely. That’s a great question. One of the key reasons for acquisitions is that we can actually take advantage of the synergies that we can get. This is almost one plus one equal to three. That’s number one. Number two is, then on top of the synergies, the innovation pipeline, let’s say, the acquired company has and the experience that we have. When you combine those two together, I think we can create innovation at scale. That is two of the key reasons why we can go on and acquire a company. And when we do that, I think one of the most important aspects of that is then to take that acquired company and then basically integrate that company within our business processes. I would say that is a key activity that you have to partake in when you acquire a company. As we have gone through some of these digitalization journeys, as I said, we are pretty experienced with integrating some of these acquired companies into our enterprise, our systems, as well as in business processes. But that journey typically is not trivial. I mean, it takes a long time to integrate and acquire a company into our business processes. As we go through that journey, many times, being able to gain the insights of the business as quickly as possible is one of the key aspects of it because that starts getting you the returns on an acquisition much faster. To be able to do that, I think having a single view of finance, having a single view of the supply chain as early and as fast as possible, is one of the most important things. Having a technology—or I would say a single pane of glass—that sits right on top of our platforms and also on top of the acquired business’ platform and us being able to look at a consolidated data view of both the data sets together is one of the most important things that can help us get synergies out of this business as fast as possible.That’s one aspect of it. The second aspect is with us having invested in some of the SaaS [software-as-a-service] solutions or SaaS applications, what ends up happening when you have the SaaS applications is that we end up not customizing these applications in a way that the industry looks at them. As a matter of fact, when you have an HR application, it is very standard and industry standard. Now when you acquire a business, if our business processes are pretty similar to each other, and if you have a SaaS solution and if they also use a SaaS solution, to integrate that certain business process onto our business processes becomes a lot easier. There is another aspect of why the new technology and the cloud platforms can be really helpful. And last but not least is, the moment you acquire a company, you also get a lot of business systems and applications that the acquired company had been using to run their businesses. As we integrate the acquired company onto us, what is important is to reduce that technical debt as fast as possible. Because the technical debt that we acquired has license costs, it has legal costs to it, it has data costs to it, and it has IT costs to it. If you look at them, the faster we get out of them, the better off we are. I mean, our aspect becomes simpler. And what we end up doing many times is we archive the data from the systems onto some of these cloud platforms and cloud services, and then are able to look at that from a historical perspective that helps us decommission this technical debt as fast as possible. Laurel: Well, we’ve certainly covered quite a bit of the current state of how you’re looking at technology. What are you thinking about for the future? How are you seeing technology innovation really helping in the next three to five years? Amit: That’s a great question. I will say that AI, even though it’s a buzzword, I think that it is a technology that does seem like it has a pretty great future even for us. Let me give you an example. As I said before, we journal terabytes of data within our four walls, just based upon doing business as usual. Now, there are so many things, as I said, gems that exist within our data set today. As humans, sometimes it is very hard to glean out what those gems are. I truly feel that the technology that exists and that is going to be coming out can look inside our data sets and be able to provide insights as to what are the data sets that we probably have not thought about can be leveraged further to, as I said, find the gems. That’s one side of the world. And the second side of the world is the unknowns, the predicting demand of the customers based upon the changing tastes and the demographics of our consumers, and then combining that data with the data that already exists within our system. I think that humans are going to take a long time to be able to get some insights, and AI definitely is going to be one of the key technologies that can help us get there faster. That’s number one. Number two is training using augmented reality. While I think “meta” seems like one of the other buzzwords that is out there, I think AR can definitely be of huge benefit to us. Typically, people have different ways of learning. Let’s say that you put somebody in a plant, a new employee. As you know, retention is very hard nowadays. If you have new employees coming in all the time, to train them on our processes and our machinery, our methods of working, I think it is generally pretty hard. But now think about if you are able to train this new team member that we have coming in with the means of some kind of augmentation. I think that is going to be the next generation of training and I feel that that can be something really cool that can happen in the future. Last but not the least, I would say machine learning, again, is used as a buzzword a lot, but in my mind, machine learning and putting the machine learning on some very small computers and then putting these computers in our manufacturing location where people are doing some of these mundane tasks day in and day out. The classic feedback control systems are not working efficiently, and there’s a human interaction needed. Where these tasks are performed, these mundane tasks are performed using humans. [But what if] we were able to introduce machine learning to be able to get rid of these mundane tasks that humans do and let them focus on more important things? I think machine learning in a box is going to be one of the other technologies that excites me. Laurel: Excellent. Those are great insights Amit.

As senior director of IT for the packaged food company Conagra , Amit Khot is optimistic about the ways modern technology solutions and infrastructure can enable businesses to thrive and innovate . Khot describes the power of advanced data analytics to both improve a company ’ s understanding of its customers and to optimize its operations . The ability to combine internal company data with data collected from social media and at point of sale will enable savvy companies to recognize new patterns . These advanced analytics , he says , will go beyond answering standard questions about financials and historical performance to provide insight into more complex questions about customers ’ thoughts and changing preferences . Meanwhile , these same data tools can also be used to fine-tune daily business operations , pinpointing issues with order fulfillment , improving long-range supply-and-demand forecasting , and digitizing manufacturing plant processes . Khot explains , “ Planning is looking into the future , depending upon your past historical data , as to what your future demand and supply should look like . We have gone through a journey to modernize our planning platforms. ” A modern enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) system is also a must for a distributed organization like Conagra . A single connected ERP system can manage and provide visibility into business processes that involve multiple divisions or departments . By doing so , a modern ERP can also ease highly complex processes , such as the technology integration of a newly acquired company . Says Khot , “ having a single view of finance , having a single view of the supply chain as early and as fast as possible , is one of the most important things that can help us get synergies out of the business as fast as possible. ” This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Infosys Cobalt . FULL TRANSCRIPT Laurel Ruma : From MIT Technology Review , I ’ m Laurel Ruma and this is Business Lab , the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace . Our topic today is technological evolution . Companies , whether they ’ re regional or global , startup or legacy , need to be able to quickly deploy technologies as markets and supply chains shift and change . While many worries may keep executives up at night , building modern systems , and adopting the right technologies to better understand data will help those executives and companies gain efficiencies and provide an excellent customer experience . Two words for you : meeting demand . My guest is Amit Khot , Senior Director of IT for Conagra . Welcome , Amit.This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Infosys Cobalt . Amit Khot : Hello , nice to meet you . Laurel : Great to have you here . So just a little background in case folks aren ’ t familiar with Conagra as a consumer packaged goods company that has been around for more than 100 years . Conagra produces products like Birds Eye , Healthy Choice , and Slim Jim ; various foods that you can find in supermarkets and in restaurants around the world . You have been with Conagra now for 23 years . How has your role evolved as a company and technology has transformed ? Amit : Absolutely . I started with Conagra , as you said , 23 years ago and I started as a program analyst with the company . Again , 23 years ago is a long time . Program analyst starting from that point and then I evolved into implementing our SAP ecosystem . That is what I started doing in the early 2000s . As time evolved , in the early 2010s , we started with a lot of mergers and acquisitions of businesses similar to ours . And as we started doing that , I played a role in doing due diligence for those businesses from an IT perspective . In addition to that , I also then helped integrate those companies within Conagra or Conagra Enterprise . In 2015 or so , we then did some divestitures and spins during that time , and I played a role in doing our program rating , an entire spinoff that we did for one of our major potato businesses , and I played the role of program director for that . During the same time , what we did is we went through an SG & A [ selling , general , and administrative expense ] reduction program , and I worked with some of our consulting businesses to come up with an analysis to say how much we spend on our production support . And that is the time when we actually contracted with Infosys to help us do the production support as part of aligning with the rest of the industry , where most of the industries were getting production support done by an outsourcing partner . I helped with that and right after that happened I had an opportunity to lead our SAP and integration platform . I did that and finally I ended up being in a role that I ’ m in right now , where I do enterprise architecture for applications on various value streams . That includes supply chain , manufacturing , finance , our global business systems , as well as platforms and integration . That ’ s my role currently , and that has been my journey for the last 23 years . A long time . Laurel : Well , certainly a long history of the company and how it evolved as well . But more recently , what kind of digital transformation has Conagra gone through in these recent years , and how do you approach these shifts and changes from an IT perspective ? Amit : I think that ’ s a great question . Digital transformation has many meanings . I mean [ sometimes ] , you do something which is really transformative . In other cases , you keep up with modernizing your technologies . One of the major initiatives that I helped design and lead initially was our S4 implementation . I helped with coming up with the design for our S4 , which is what we call our ERP [ enterprise resource planning ] modernization program . And now I help that program with providing subject matter expertise across the various aspects of how a modern ERP should look . That is one of the programs that we are going through right now . One of the other transformation journeys that , as a company , we have gone through is planning transformation . Planning is looking into the future , depending upon your past historical data , as to what your future demand and supply should look like . We have gone through a journey to modernize our planning platforms . It ’ s one of the other things that we have done . In addition to that , we are currently marching on a journey now to modernize and digitize our manufacturing . A large initiative . You might know that we have multiple plants and manufacturing locations and co-packers . Digitizing can ensure that we get the most efficiencies out of our platforms . So that is underway . And last but not the least , I will say that we have started getting pretty good maturity and understanding on various cloud services or cloud platforms in general . And as such , we have started maturing in cloud platforms like Azure services or SAP ’ s BTP [ Business Technology Platform ] and such . Those are some of the key initiatives that we have gone through to digitally transform our business and there are a lot of things that we plan on doing in the future . Laurel : I think it was particularly important that you mentioned that your role encompasses so many different parts of the company , because supply chain is certainly one of those important ones , and you have to think of systems from end to end . So how did the covid-19 pandemic affect Conagra as people worked from home and started to shop online and do that more and more ? Did this shift intensify adoption of specific technologies within the company ? Amit : What we didn ’ t do is we didn ’ t create a different strategy just to attack the covid pandemic . We had a lot of strategies built . I think one of the most important things that we had to do during the covid pandemic was keeping the system stable . Keeping the system stable is not a trivial task . I mean , if you look at our application and platform portfolios , it ’ s pretty large . Keeping everything up and running so that we can actually fulfill the customer ’ s demand is a big deal , and to keep them going , I think that was one of the most important things that we did during the pandemic . The next thing I would say is that we were premature in using our collaborative platform and collaboration technologies , like Office 365 and Webex , even before covid hit us . I would say that with the pandemic and everybody going remote , one of the most important things that we did is that we added more resiliency to some of those platforms . And our usage of that platform spiked to such an extent that that was almost a call that we failed . I mean , how much collaboration people did during that time using the technology . There were a lot of times before that , where people used to be in the rooms and in conference rooms doing whiteboarding and such , and delivering projects , being in one place , but with covid , I think people were leveraging a lot of these collaborative technologies to be able to get there . I would say the third thing that we did is , covid opened our eyes to how we changed our way of working . Before , we used to be delivering a lot of our solutions using waterfall methodologies . They used to be very long and they used to take up a lot of time , and we would not be able to figure out until the end whether we are going to be succeeding with some of the projects or not . We then adopted continuous delivery as a way to deliver work . And that spiked up the use of tools like JIRA quite a bit . But that was started during the covid time and we continue to use that more and more . And lastly , I would say that we had to do analysis on our data to figure out how we can , as I said before , how do we keep our system stable . But then also analyzing how do we fulfill the demand , and , as such , what are some of our pain points ? And we used some of the cloud platforms and cloud services to do some quick analysis to be able to fulfill our shipments . Those are the few things that we did and learned and adopted during the covid-19 pandemic . Laurel : And that ’ s certainly important to be able to actually see that data in real-time to help your customers . How do you think adopting cloud and using more data technologies will help your customer experience improve ? Amit : I think one of the most important things in our business is to have a 360-degree view of customers . I mean , it ’ s pretty vital , right ? As you might know , our business is a very customer-focused business . For us , large retailers are typically our customers . Our consumer is one step removed from us . What the technological advancement helps us now do , is , today , most of the information that we create as we do the business , resides within our four walls . As the social media platforms and such have become prominent , what is really important to us is being able to have the data that is inside of our four walls , mash that up with the data that is coming from the social media platforms , plus the point of sale data , all those things . When you mash all these things together , I think it provides us pretty decent consumer insights . These consumer insights , ultimately , lead us to a lot of product innovation . You might have seen our CEO talk about that . We have created a pretty decent new innovation pipeline during the last few years . And I think the digital technology and the technology that exists out there has definitely provided us with , I would say , a lot of capabilities to be able to innovate faster . The next thing I would say is the innovation side of the business is one side of the world , but the other side is then being able to fulfill the shipments on time and in full . If you look at it , there are a lot of customers of ours who want most of our shipments to be on time and in full . And if that doesn ’ t happen , we end up paying fines . Some of these digital technologies help us pinpoint where our issues are and what we should be doing differently to be able to fulfill our shipments on time and in full . That is another thing that we have gotten better at , and it ’ s just based upon the improvement of technology . Better planning . Better planning is equal to being able to predict the demands of our consumers and customers and how that then leads to us to be able to plan out some of the long-term horizons of supply . How do we do that from the long-term to the medium-term to the short-term . Those are the things that we have been able to do as a part of delivering some of our planning projects . That is based upon some of the modern technology that exists out there . And lastly , I would say the shop floor agility in general . With us investing in digital manufacturing , I would say that technology has definitely enabled us to be able to deliver digitization within manufacturing that has increased the shop floor agility . And I would say that that is going to be a long journey for us , but we are marching towards the results where we will be a lot more agile on the shop floor than we have ever been before . Laurel : And that ’ s so important when there are just more challenges thrown your way and also all these opportunities with such fantastic technology as well . And you mentioned this earlier , but why does Conagra need an enterprise resource planning system , and how does it partner with companies like Infosys to stay on that cutting edge of technology to make sure you can answer all of these challenges ? Amit : Yeah , that ’ s a great question . I mean , as I mentioned before , we have numerous plants , numerous customers , and numerous business partners that we work with . Once you have a lot of these , the impact and the business processes that cross doing these businesses , that crosses HR , that crosses supply chain , that crosses manufacturing . There are customer-facing business processes that exist . And if you look at all these processes that exist within any business like we have , which is basically a consumer foods business , what ends up happening is that if you do not have a combined view of your business at one place , it becomes an extremely hard proposition . Just doing simple business can become really hard . So it is really important for us to have a connected system , a connected view of business processes , and to enable something like that . ERPs play a very important role . As I said during your first question , when you asked me , “ what was your journey ? ” We started our journey of implementing SAP as an ERP in the early 2000s . One of the prime reasons for doing that is exactly to solve the problem that I just talked about : how do we get a consolidated view of our entire business cycle ? And that is what ERP helps us deliver . Now , ERP doesn ’ t just give you the stack of your business , but it also then gives you an ability to do analysis of the data that is in your system , and then create transformations that you wouldn ’ t do before , if all the systems in this business process were independent and isolated . So that is one of the big reasons why ERPs play such an important role in business like ours , and I would say that that is the case with most of the industry that we are in . Now when it comes to help from partners like Infosys to create the innovation , I would say it is a two-part answer . One of the first things is that ERPs have become so important in just running our business that having a stable system is one of the most important things that typically many of the IT functions deliver . To keep ourselves stable , partners like Infosys that help us manage our production and production support , they play an important aspect and role in making sure that the systems are stable and current from a technology perspective . That ’ s one aspect of it . Another thing that Infosys , and partners like Infosys , are helping us just do the production support . That frees up capacity of our subject matter experts to be able to then look at different solutions to solve the new business problems that pop up for us . That frees up the capacity for them to be able to do different things . That ’ s number two . Number three is that the companies like Infosys , and other business partners that we have , have a lot of customers just like us and even customers that are not in the same industry as us . What they hear , the business problems they hear from these other businesses and other customers that they have , that gives them an advantage in insights that we as Conagra by ourselves won ’ t be able to get . Because everybody has a different problem that they ’ re trying to solve . And if Infosys has that insight , they can provide us a great external point of view to be able to then solve some of the business problems that we have , which could be similar to what somebody else might have seen . And that just helps us solve these business problems faster . And this is an external point of view from a customer-centric perspective , but at the same time , with the scale and the number of partners that Infosys deals with , especially from the supplier side of the world , there are technologies that Infosys has reached which we do not have reach of . Partners like Infosys can even bring some of these advanced technologies that exist out there and provide us and guide us in . I believe that there lies a huge opportunity for companies like that to help us bring these new technologies and platforms to be able to help us solve some of the business problems that we have today—and probably solve and provide us insights into some of the business problems that might be coming to us that we have not thought about . Laurel : That ’ s a great point about the partnership with Infosys , and in general , how you actually bring the data and predictive analytics to your capabilities because you do have so much data coming in from fifty different brands , countless vendors , all those customers . How can this be maximized to gain those insights ? Amit : Yeah , that ’ s a great question . And just as you said , many brands and countless business partners and customers . We generate terabytes of data every year , and that data typically lies in our four walls . I mean , just in our ERPs and our business warehouse systems . And based upon that data , I think most of the industries like us have gotten really good at doing traditional analytics . Traditional analytics is equal to , how are our financials looking ? What is the performance of a certain brand depending upon the historical data ? And so on and so forth . I mean , that is the traditional analytics that we have gotten really good at . What becomes important now that you have gotten good traditional analytics is , what do you not know yet ? What are those gems within your existing data that you have not taken advantage of ? Some of these newer technologies and platforms , what they have started helping us do , and probably they ’ ll keep on helping us do , is being able to glean into our data and start pointing to what is it that we are not looking at . I mean , what we know is always great , but those unknowns that we have not actually gleaned into is what some of these technologies that are coming forward are going to be able to help us look at . That ’ s one aspect of the world . Now , the second aspect of the world is , as I said , the data exists just within our four walls . But as I said before , that social media data , that point of sale data , the data that doesn ’ t exist within our four walls , I think that has a different kind of insight and power . Now , think about the fact that you are able to mash up the data which is from these external sources and the data that you have inside , and then think about some of the data that you generate just because you have consumers that are calling into your consumer affairs division . You take all this data mashed up together , and I think you can create analytics that we were never able to produce before . And I think that is a power of what we get from just mashing all this data , and matching all this data together , and we can maximize a lot of insights . And then once you have that mashup happen , I think the predictions are different . In the sense that many times our existing forecasting solutions typically are very much dependent upon historical data to be able to do predictions on our supply and demand . They ’ re doing predictions like that . However , with the external data being mastered , I think it goes beyond that . I think it also starts giving us an insight into what the consumers are thinking , what the customers are thinking , how their tastes and choices are changing . I think that is the next forefront for us from a predictability perspective . And I think that the new technologies and platforms are going to help us do that yet better . Laurel : So this is a good point . We have this data and you need to make some really great decisions from it , but you also need to really assess those analytics , make predictions in the future , but also make sure your entire systems are running correctly end to end . How , then , can cloud applications coupled with this need and progress of your digital transformation journey help with a tactic like mergers and acquisitions that you mentioned earlier was part of your career ? How has that specifically been one of those things that helps the company actually create efficiencies and really see technology as a partner ? Amit : Yeah , absolutely . That ’ s a great question . One of the key reasons for acquisitions is that we can actually take advantage of the synergies that we can get . This is almost one plus one equal to three . That ’ s number one . Number two is , then on top of the synergies , the innovation pipeline , let ’ s say , the acquired company has and the experience that we have . When you combine those two together , I think we can create innovation at scale . That is two of the key reasons why we can go on and acquire a company . And when we do that , I think one of the most important aspects of that is then to take that acquired company and then basically integrate that company within our business processes . I would say that is a key activity that you have to partake in when you acquire a company . As we have gone through some of these digitalization journeys , as I said , we are pretty experienced with integrating some of these acquired companies into our enterprise , our systems , as well as in business processes . But that journey typically is not trivial . I mean , it takes a long time to integrate and acquire a company into our business processes . As we go through that journey , many times , being able to gain the insights of the business as quickly as possible is one of the key aspects of it because that starts getting you the returns on an acquisition much faster . To be able to do that , I think having a single view of finance , having a single view of the supply chain as early and as fast as possible , is one of the most important things . Having a technology—or I would say a single pane of glass—that sits right on top of our platforms and also on top of the acquired business ’ platform and us being able to look at a consolidated data view of both the data sets together is one of the most important things that can help us get synergies out of this business as fast as possible.That ’ s one aspect of it . The second aspect is with us having invested in some of the SaaS [ software-as-a-service ] solutions or SaaS applications , what ends up happening when you have the SaaS applications is that we end up not customizing these applications in a way that the industry looks at them . As a matter of fact , when you have an HR application , it is very standard and industry standard . Now when you acquire a business , if our business processes are pretty similar to each other , and if you have a SaaS solution and if they also use a SaaS solution , to integrate that certain business process onto our business processes becomes a lot easier . There is another aspect of why the new technology and the cloud platforms can be really helpful . And last but not least is , the moment you acquire a company , you also get a lot of business systems and applications that the acquired company had been using to run their businesses . As we integrate the acquired company onto us , what is important is to reduce that technical debt as fast as possible . Because the technical debt that we acquired has license costs , it has legal costs to it , it has data costs to it , and it has IT costs to it . If you look at them , the faster we get out of them , the better off we are . I mean , our aspect becomes simpler . And what we end up doing many times is we archive the data from the systems onto some of these cloud platforms and cloud services , and then are able to look at that from a historical perspective that helps us decommission this technical debt as fast as possible . Laurel : Well , we ’ ve certainly covered quite a bit of the current state of how you ’ re looking at technology . What are you thinking about for the future ? How are you seeing technology innovation really helping in the next three to five years ? Amit : That ’ s a great question .

That ’ s number one . Number two is training using augmented reality . While I think “ meta ” seems like one of the other buzzwords that is out there , I think AR can definitely be of huge benefit to us . Typically , people have different ways of learning . Let ’ s say that you put somebody in a plant , a new employee . As you know , retention is very hard nowadays . If you have new employees coming in all the time , to train them on our processes and our machinery , our methods of working , I think it is generally pretty hard . But now think about if you are able to train this new team member that we have coming in with the means of some kind of augmentation . I think that is going to be the next generation of training and I feel that that can be something really cool that can happen in the future . Last but not the least , I would say machine learning , again , is used as a buzzword a lot , but in my mind , machine learning and putting the machine learning on some very small computers and then putting these computers in our manufacturing location where people are doing some of these mundane tasks day in and day out .

ChatGPT can turn bad writers into better ones,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/07/13/1076199/chatgpt-can-turn-bad-writers-into-better-ones/,2023-07-13,"<p>People who use ChatGPT to help with writing tasks are more productive and produce higher-quality work than those who don’t, a study found.</p>
","People have been using ChatGPT to help them to do their jobs since it was released in November of last year, with enthusiastic adopters using it to help them write everything from marketing materials to emails to reports. Now we have the first indication of its effect in the workplace. A new study by two MIT economics graduate students, published today in Science, suggests it could help reduce gaps in writing ability between employees. They found that it could enable less experienced workers who lack writing skills to produce work similar in quality to that of more skilled colleagues. Shakked Noy and Whitney Zhang recruited 453 marketers, data analysts, and college-educated professionals and got each of them to complete two kinds of tasks they’d normally undertake as part of their jobs, such as writing press releases, short reports, or analysis plans. Half were given the option of using ChatGPT to help them complete the second of the two tasks. A group of other professionals then quality-checked the results, grading the writing on a scale of 1 to 7, with 7 the best. Each piece of work was evaluated by three people working in the same professions, hired through the research platform Prolific.  New large language models will transform many jobs. Whether they will lead to widespread prosperity or not is up to us. The writers who chose to use ChatGPT took 40% less time to complete their tasks, and produced work that the assessors scored 18% higher in quality than that of the participants who didn’t use it. The writers who were already skilled at writing were able to reduce the amount of time they spent on their work, while those who were assessed as being weaker writers produced higher-quality work once they gained access to the chatbot. “ChatGPT is just very good at producing this kind of written content, and so using it to automate parts of the writing process seems likely to save a lot of time,” says Noy, lead author of the research. “One thing that’s clear is that this is very useful for white-collar work—a lot of people will be using it, and it’s going to have a pretty big effect on how white-collar work is structured,” he adds. However, the output of ChatGPT and other generative AI models is far from reliable. ChatGPT is very good at presenting false information as factually correct, meaning that although workers may be able to leverage it to help them produce more work, they also run the risk of introducing errors.  Depending on the nature of a person’s job, those kinds of inaccuracies could have serious implications. Lawyer Steven Schwartz was fined $5,000 by a judge last month for using ChatGPT to produce a legal brief that contained false judicial opinions and legal citations.“Technological advances are commonplace and there is nothing inherently improper about using a reliable artificial intelligence tool for assistance,” the judge, Kevin Castel, wrote. “But existing rules impose a gatekeeping role on attorneys to ensure the accuracy of their filings.” The research hints at how AI could be helpful in the workplace by acting as a sort of virtual assistant, says Riku Arakawa, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University who studies workers’ use of large language models, and was not involved with the research.  ""I think this is a really interesting result that demonstrates how human-AI cooperation works really well in this kind of task. When a human leverages AI to refine their output, they can produce better content,"" he adds.

Just a year prior, only 2% of BP applications lived on the cloud. At the close of 2022, 90% of BP applications had migrated to cloud environments, changing product and service integration and BP’s overall digital operating model. Cloud transformations like BP’s can help enterprises improve operational resiliency, accelerate technology adoption, and reduce data center carbon emissions, says vice president of Digital Foundations at BP, Keisha Garcia. Migrating to the cloud at that scale, however, is challenging and extensive, especially when dealing with a legacy IT estate. “Utilizing cloud platforms provides the necessary computational power and tools to implement advanced analytics, predictive modeling, as well as simulation techniques, which also enables us to continuously improve our sustainability performance,” says Garcia. To successfully migrate to the cloud and subsequently collaborate and deploy cloud technologies, Garcia stresses the importance of clear communication among employees as well as stakeholders. “Involve application teams, service owners, end users early in the development and delivery of the strategy. Again, just bringing everyone along for the journey, I cannot overstate how important that is,” says Garcia. A hybrid approach to transformation that combines cloud migration with the retention of some applications, dedicated data centers, and intermediary migration environments can ensure cost effective and secure operations. With enterprise-wide communication underpinning any successful transformation, Garcia outlines having a strong and flexible governance framework, collaborating with external digital partners, and adapting to agile ways of working as best practices for complex cloud migrations. Looking to the cloud-enabled future, Garcia identifies the convergence of AI and edge computing, mounting progress in quantum computing, and the proliferation of IoT connected devices as transformative technologies that will drive forward better business outcomes.   “I think that the convergence of edge computing and AI presents an exciting opportunity for the real-time data, a real-time low latency processing and decision making at the network edge, which is extremely critical for us, given all of the platforms, rigs that we have out across the globe,” says Garcia.

Laurel Ruma: From MIT Technology Review, I'm Laurel Ruma, and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.Our topic today is building a better cloud ecosystem. From partners to internal stakeholders, enterprises are meeting challenges by deploying and innovating with cloud computing solutions. The key is to work as a team and build talent resources to confidently adopt emerging technologies.Two words for you: optimizing cloud.My guest is Keisha Garcia. Keisha is the vice president of Digital Foundations at BP.This episode of Business Lab is sponsored by Infosys Cobalt.Welcome, Keisha. Keisha Garcia: Thank you, Laurel. I'm happy to be here. Laurel: Well, let's start off. So, what has BP's move to the cloud been like? From your perspectives, what are the major benefits and challenges with cloud transformation? Keisha: Yeah, so our journey from my perspective has been exciting, it's been complex, it's been a learning journey all the while. And it's been long. It's been pretty long. Our journey started in 2013 and we were experimenting on cloud computing for email services and HR learning management systems. And then you fast-forward to 2016, and we were about 2% of our BP applications were on the cloud. As the company, we were conducting proof of concepts and determining what was the best approach and how do we do this at scale, large scale. In 2017, we adopted a cloud-first approach, meaning that anything that was any new hardware, any new system builds were going to be on the cloud, no more adding to our existing, at the time, eight mega data centers and over 107 different data centers throughout our regions throughout the world. We had decided that we were no longer going to add anything, unless it was to the cloud. Or if it had to be on-prem, it had to be by exception only. And so that kind of motivated us to push along and got everybody along for the journey. But again, just getting all of our business and everyone else sold into the business or sold into cloud and cloud concepts and all of those things, given the fact that there were a lot of unknowns at the time, so working with just different vendor partners and trying to find as knowledgeable people as possible. So again, that just all fed to the complexity. By the close of 2022, we had gotten into our stride pretty well and had done quite a few, or a large part of our state, over 90% of our state, to be exact, we have migrated to our cloud environments, which enabled our faster product and service introduction and changing the BP digital operating model, which we've moved now to a product-led organization. So our cloud migrations, I think some of the biggest benefits was it helped us optimize BP's technology stack. Of course, it increased our operational resilience. It introduced new network and data architectures, accelerated our technology adoption, helped to push the modernizing of our state and keeping those evergreen, it also assisted in the reduction of our CO2 emissions from our data centers. However, migrating to the cloud at the scale that we've had to, as large as our landscape is, again, as I said, was challenging, complex, and extensive because we had extensive legacy IT estate. And as I said earlier on, just hosted in the eight large mega data centers throughout the US, as well as in Europe, and then also just the myriad of data centers that we have across our regions. So the challenge, I cannot overstate, it has been that, but the gains have been great. Laurel: So that's a great look at the past and the journey that BP has been on. So, what are some of the major cloud trends you're seeing today? Keisha: So some of the major trends that we're seeing today from a platforms perspective, see increasing numbers of organizations looking to consolidate their business applications on the cloud-based platforms, be more cloud native, have robust data and analytics platforms as well that will allow both real-time and on-demand access to key business information. Again, as we said, we've moved to a product-led organization, so we're seeing that, of course, there's several companies that are doing the same. Digital teams are aligning to product-led operating models to ensure customer centricity and customer focus. And then also just putting that at the forefront. And then product development and enabling business and business-led prioritization and product delivery, which helps, again, with us aligning more to our business strategy. And given where we are going with moving to an integrated energy company and our transition with re:Invent, that has been huge for us. There's lots of markets that we're tapping into, lots of things that we're doing, and we have to get on board with the business to be able to be dynamic and be able to shift and be able to move, and to be able to provide a faster time to market with solutions. And so from that standpoint, being on a cloud platform, having all of the technology that's available to us to do that at pace and align with our business has been awesome for us. And I'm seeing a lot more companies wanting to just share experiences and knowledge because they're trying to do the same. Also, just the cloud native piece of that and cloud native enterprise is an organization that has aligned business and technology teams to help, again, modernize the estate, but we have to build more cloud native capability so that things can be more plug and play versus the huge build outs. And then again, having to do a lot of the upgrading and all of the things that would come along with not building and being on top, or being with more in the cloud native state. Also, just again, part of our reinvention journey, this also enables climate action. We're seeing a lot of folks that are moving towards doing the things that align with the Paris Agreement, as well as all of the things that we're doing along re:Invent. So decarbonizing digital as assets directly impacts about 2% of the global energy consumption. So therefore, it helps. Every bit helps. And so therefore, those are the things that we're seeing. And we're also, of course, moving there in that space to also assist with us getting to net zero. There's also just being able to be more of a connected world. So 2023, this year and beyond, promises, opportunities for large scale industrial 5G, broadband based IoT usage and catapult connections for remote regions. And so we've really started to build off that as well with building digital twins and all of the different things that we're doing at our refineries, and then also on our rigs and platforms that will capitalize on just the cloud-based technology. So, there's quite a few things that we're seeing that are trending, but things that we're already in the works with and moving towards. And the last one is just the evolution of the CIO that we're seeing. The CIO seems to have gone away. I don't see a lot of CIO titles anymore that are out there. And we definitely have moved away from that, as well as the way our organization is structured. And as I said earlier, aligning a lot more with product led organizations and making sure that we have technology leaders that are elevating their financial acumen, along with business prioritizations and outcomes, and bringing that business value and finding where those value streams are within your business strategies and aligning to those, and then evaluating and bringing about the technology that will be the catalyst and a differentiator for most businesses, and definitely ours. Laurel: That's quite a bit. And you mentioned this a little bit earlier, but how do you actually bring together a company to maintain and manage and optimize all of those business practices in the cloud? What are some of those best practices companies should be thinking about in order to collaborate and deploy cloud technologies? Keisha: I think the biggest thing that we are seeing, or that I saw that were best practices and lessons learned and things, is just providing clear stakeholder communications. If you don't have your business on board and understand what it is that you're doing and why you're doing it and what's in it for them, it's going to be hard. It's going to be really, really hard to do a mass migration as we have, an adoption of cloud, the way that we have. And I hate that covid-19 happened, but it definitely forced the business to really see the benefit because we were pretty much about, I want to say 50% on the cloud by the time, probably a little less than 50% on the cloud, by the time covid hit, but we were on the cloud for our major things. And our business really didn't skip a beat really with being able to connect from anywhere in the world. And so they saw the benefit of that. They saw some of the things that we had talked about. But just having that clear outline of communication around what you will get, what you don't get, where you will be in each part of the journey, I cannot express how important that it was to do that. Involve application teams, service owners, end users early in the development and delivery of the strategy. Again, just bringing everyone along for the journey, I cannot overstate how important that is. Modify your operating model, your digital operating model specifically to align so that you're working more seamlessly together across different areas and allowing for the breakdown of expertise in particular areas and having that focus on that expertise and continuing to develop that and evolve that. Because technology, as always, but definitely in this space, changes extremely quickly. And so therefore, you have got to ensure that your people are getting as educated, updated with the skill sets as possible. And building on the benefits, a realization plan, was also key. So those are some of the softer ones that I would think that people might overlook. Other ones, just the hybrid approach that we had, the hybrid approach to transformation. We recognized early on the need for a hybrid approach, combining our cloud migration with the retention of certain applications, dedicated data centers, intermediary migration environments, allowing for cost effective and secure operations. Those are some of the best practices as far as just how we were going to transform and what that looks like, and not thinking that it's a one size fits all and being able to assess your estate, what's best if you have a large in the service of life estate, a legacy estate, as we did where we were legacy with operating model—the code base on our applications across our entire landscape, it was huge. I think when we first started this journey, a good amount of over 60% of our estate was in the end of the service of a life due to one of one or the other of the things that I just mentioned. And so instead of trying to tackle those separately, we decided, what's the best way for us to leverage and bring that all together? So being flexible and looking at the art of the possible across your state and what you have to do to address multiple things was also really a great way to look at this as well. Because you and I probably know from experience, just any time that you say that you're going to go back and do something, nine times out of 10, you don't. You do the first tactical thing and it stays that way forever. So it was, for me, a good thing for us to take best practice, to, if we only have to do something once or only have to open up the box once, then let's just open it up once and figure out how much of transformation can we do in one time to keep us at ease, but also to cover as much modernization as we can before we hand them back over to our ops teams. I think I've already touched on just CIO buy-in and business buy-in. Those are best practices, some of those things that were softer that I mentioned earlier. Having a governance framework, delivery model restructured for effectiveness, and how do you get things approved and establish those things, again, upfront, having that delivery model to ensure smooth cloud migrations while also ensuring business service continuity and accommodating evolving business requirements? Because as you know, again, with some of the trends that we talked about or that I mentioned earlier, those trends are things that when you start to go and implement those things, the business change is enormous. And so being able to be flexible to accommodate those, but not being beared down by who needs to approve this, who's making this decision. If you establish those things upfront with a good governance framework and a delivery model that allows for that flexibility and effectiveness, then that was also key and golden. The collaboration with digital delivery partners. I can't express enough finding great delivery partners. There's no way that knowledge is known by everyone in your organization. And like I said, given the pace at which technology changes and things are being rolled out, you always need people that are also keeping their fingers on the pulse from learnings and different experiences. And so you can only get that sometimes if you also worked externally with external partners. And we had a couple of them, quite a few of them actually, that proved to be very, very great partners. And we all learned together with several of the others, but Emphasis has been a major partner of ours. We had eight vendor partners to supplement in-house capabilities, and it was great. Adapting modern ways of working, agility. And agility in its simplest forms, but also just being agile and utilizing agile practices, which will help you move much faster, setting up your squads, those types of things. And then of course, I'll say it again, last one, but communication, communication, communication, and training for sustainability and just continuing to build your knowledge base to be able to continue to support the platforms and the new technology that's coming on board. So those are some of the things that we saw, or that's lessons learned, best practices in general. Laurel: You mentioned this a little bit earlier, but how critical is talent to that kind of cloud transformation? And what are some of techniques–communication clearly–for recruiting and refining talent for adopting cloud technologies? Keisha: Yeah. Given the fact that, as we talked, there's so many people that are going along this journey, some at the very beginning, some middle, some almost nearing the end. But because of that, the market out there is extremely competitive to get great talent. And then also, just upscaling your talent that you have in the door already. Your existing staff is also critical. So, offering a competitive compensation package, as well as providing training and certification opportunities. Because again, it's keeping your employees motivated and keeping them focused on being a hundred percent all in and passionate around what we're doing and why we're doing it, but also recognizing that people have to enjoy what they do. And the compensation package has to be great. And also, the learning opportunities and promoting a learning culture has to be there because that's what people are looking for. As we see, as people are moving from place to place, in order to retain great talent, in order to attract great talent, all of those offerings need to be there. They're important. They're important for the success of any transformation program that you're doing for some of the reasons that I touched on earlier, the pace at which technology moves, as well as the fact that everybody is out doing all of these things to test the waters, and to also create a more sustainable environment, to also create, to be able to get to market faster, to create all the different trends that are happening with people working in different spaces and places across the globe. All of those things, the offerings have to be there to attract that talent. But most of all, also building a diverse and inclusive workforce. And in order to do that, the offering has to be there across the board for people that want to work from home, people that want to work in an office building, people that are doing different things or at different stages and points in their lives. Having that flexibility to offer your employees to retain that great talent is absolutely key and critical for the purposes of the success of your transformation. Laurel: And then you did mention the importance of working with partners, especially when you're trying to build this collaborative ecosystem. So, what is that like working with partners in this large-scale cloud transformation? Keisha: Again, you can't know everything, and you're not always going to get all of those things. So that's where you have the extension of, I would say an extension of additional brain power, extension of learning and those things. Leveraging partnerships with educational institutions, collaborating with universities and colleges to establish internships, co-op programs, and recruitment pipelines for cloud related roles. Because again, as you see in universities, technology is key and they're learning new things. And students coming out of universities, they're more conscious of all of the things that are going on in the environment, and they're wanting to work with people that are moving towards making the environment better and the sustainability of that. And the low carbon initiatives that are going on and getting to net zero, believe it or not, those are all things that are known. As soon as I go into recruiting at a university, it's the first thing that they ask. What's really going on with re:Invent? What do you see and how do you utilize technology to help leverage that? So I think building those partnerships with educational institutions are great, as well as those partnerships with our third-party vendors that we've done as well, because they're doing some of the same things with getting students, and as well as keeping up with the trends, keeping up their skillsets and capabilities and being able to have that flex staff to flex up and down as necessary. As you go through the ebb and flows of your journey of transformation, things start, stop, and/or increase, and sometimes you need to move at pace, or just the complexities that comes with marrying things with moving off of your legacy estate and still trying to keep that BAU [business as usual] and no downtime for your business. So therefore, all of those things, you cannot know within one organization. You have to look to research and development. And again, the partnerships with the universities, the partnerships with third-party vendors are absolutely critical and key. Laurel: You've mentioned sustainability a couple times. So how moving to the cloud and adopting these kinds of emerging technologies actually help BP as a company address the sustainability goals that it may have? Keisha: We have the reduced environmental impact paired with efficient resource utilization. So, moving to the cloud allowed us to reduce our carbon footprint by transitioning from on-premise data centers to a more energy efficient cloud infrastructure. We are dual cloud company. We use both AWS and Microsoft Azure. And so definitely working with both of them for what they're doing around the energy efficient cloud infrastructure that they're pushing and doing, and working with them on all hands of how to measure that. Also what's the projection of what we're going to contribute as we continue to move forward and get to nearing the end of our cloud journey. Also enabling us to optimize our energy consumption, like I said, by scaling resources up and down based on demand, driving efficient energy usage, reducing waste, and contributing to our wider BP sustainability goals as well. There was a time, again, when we were on-prem and we would have large amounts of servers running. And some of those servers were literally less than 50% utilized. But yet they're still on. They're still utilizing energy as well. So this moving to cloud allows us, again, from the optimization perspective of what we consume. Also, low carbon emissions, data-driven sustainability, and enhanced operational efficiency. Moving to the cloud supports and drives our low carbon emission by enabling our company to utilize renewable power sources, so by adopting emerging technologies, such as AI and machine learning. The transformation to cloud allows for us to analyze vast amounts of data, driving our innovation and decision-making power for BP's sustainable initiatives. And again, this has been huge for us. And being data-driven helps identify opportunities for resource optimization, emissions reduction, as well as environmental impact mitigation. So in the data space, large opportunities there. And then also, there's just a continuous improvement in innovation, and having or utilizing cloud platforms provides the necessary computational power and tools to implement advanced analytics, predictive modeling, as well as simulation techniques, which also enables us to continuously improve our sustainability performance. And it also allows for new solutions to be provided, as well as to contribute to all of the industry-wide sustainability advancements, things that when I get around other CIO tables or other tables with other people that are leading their transformations, we share ideas, we talk about the things that we're doing, how we're measuring that. And sharing that across the table is really good because, again, you get to also hear some of the things that they're doing, which gives you some of the ideas of how they're using technology to continue with the sustainability goals. So from that standpoint, that's how we've helped to leverage our cloud transformation to help with our sustainability aspirations of getting to net zero. Laurel: Yeah, that's quite significant. You've outlined major cloud trends like going cloud native that you're seeing today. So, what are some of the cloud-enabled technologies or use cases that you're really excited to see emerge in the next three to five years? Keisha: So, I would say that I'm really excited about...there's quite a few, so I'll try and limit it. So edge AI. I think that the convergence of edge computing and AI presents an exciting opportunity for the real-time data, a real-time low latency processing and decision making at the network edge, which is extremely critical for us, given all of the platforms, rigs, that we have out across the globe. That is absolutely key. And I'm excited about that because this technology helps to enable and develop our innovative applications in our industry to optimize the energy consumption of smart grids and enhance predictive maintenance and our operations. So for me, edge AI is really one that I'm excited about. Also, quantum computing. It has the potential to solve complex problems and perform computations that are currently infeasible for classical computers. So in the next three to five years, I'd expect to see significant progress in quantum computing technology, which has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach computational challenges and drive innovation across multiple sectors of our business, but multiple sectors of the energy industry in general. And then I'll probably think of a couple more. I would say things have progressed quite far along in this space, but IoT and integration and analytics in that space, the proliferation of IoT devices continues to generate massive volumes of data. So cloud platforms will play a crucial role in processing, analyzing, and extracting meaningful insights from this data. In the next few years, and currently even today, I think we see further advancements in cloud based IoT integration analytics, as well as enabling US or other organizations to harness the full potential of IoT data, which will drive smarter decision making and predictive maintenance, as well as asset optimization and automation, or optimization rather. So I just think from an IoT perspective, again, big driver. We've been doing digital twins, we've been doing quite a few things within our platforms and just within our production business. Those are some of the three that really excite me. And then of course, there's augmented reality, but I won't go into that. But there's a few things that are coming along that really excite us and will be driving our business forward. Laurel: Fantastic. Keisha, thank you so much for joining us today on the Business Lab.

In 2017 , we adopted a cloud-first approach , meaning that anything that was any new hardware , any new system builds were going to be on the cloud , no more adding to our existing , at the time , eight mega data centers and over 107 different data centers throughout our regions throughout the world . We had decided that we were no longer going to add anything , unless it was to the cloud . Or if it had to be on-prem , it had to be by exception only . And so that kind of motivated us to push along and got everybody along for the journey . But again , just getting all of our business and everyone else sold into the business or sold into cloud and cloud concepts and all of those things , given the fact that there were a lot of unknowns at the time , so working with just different vendor partners and trying to find as knowledgeable people as possible . So again , that just all fed to the complexity . By the close of 2022 , we had gotten into our stride pretty well and had done quite a few , or a large part of our state , over 90 % of our state , to be exact , we have migrated to our cloud environments , which enabled our faster product and service introduction and changing the BP digital operating model , which we 've moved now to a product-led organization . So our cloud migrations , I think some of the biggest benefits was it helped us optimize BP 's technology stack . Of course , it increased our operational resilience . It introduced new network and data architectures , accelerated our technology adoption , helped to push the modernizing of our state and keeping those evergreen , it also assisted in the reduction of our CO2 emissions from our data centers . However , migrating to the cloud at the scale that we 've had to , as large as our landscape is , again , as I said , was challenging , complex , and extensive because we had extensive legacy IT estate . And as I said earlier on , just hosted in the eight large mega data centers throughout the US , as well as in Europe , and then also just the myriad of data centers that we have across our regions . So the challenge , I can not overstate , it has been that , but the gains have been great . Laurel : So that 's a great look at the past and the journey that BP has been on . So , what are some of the major cloud trends you 're seeing today ? Keisha : So some of the major trends that we 're seeing today from a platforms perspective , see increasing numbers of organizations looking to consolidate their business applications on the cloud-based platforms , be more cloud native , have robust data and analytics platforms as well that will allow both real-time and on-demand access to key business information . Again , as we said , we 've moved to a product-led organization , so we 're seeing that , of course , there 's several companies that are doing the same . Digital teams are aligning to product-led operating models to ensure customer centricity and customer focus . And then also just putting that at the forefront . And then product development and enabling business and business-led prioritization and product delivery , which helps , again , with us aligning more to our business strategy . And given where we are going with moving to an integrated energy company and our transition with re : Invent , that has been huge for us . There 's lots of markets that we 're tapping into , lots of things that we 're doing , and we have to get on board with the business to be able to be dynamic and be able to shift and be able to move , and to be able to provide a faster time to market with solutions . And so from that standpoint , being on a cloud platform , having all of the technology that 's available to us to do that at pace and align with our business has been awesome for us . And I 'm seeing a lot more companies wanting to just share experiences and knowledge because they 're trying to do the same . Also , just the cloud native piece of that and cloud native enterprise is an organization that has aligned business and technology teams to help , again , modernize the estate , but we have to build more cloud native capability so that things can be more plug and play versus the huge build outs . And then again , having to do a lot of the upgrading and all of the things that would come along with not building and being on top , or being with more in the cloud native state . Also , just again , part of our reinvention journey , this also enables climate action . We 're seeing a lot of folks that are moving towards doing the things that align with the Paris Agreement , as well as all of the things that we 're doing along re : Invent . So decarbonizing digital as assets directly impacts about 2 % of the global energy consumption . So therefore , it helps . Every bit helps . And so therefore , those are the things that we 're seeing . And we 're also , of course , moving there in that space to also assist with us getting to net zero . There 's also just being able to be more of a connected world . So 2023 , this year and beyond , promises , opportunities for large scale industrial 5G , broadband based IoT usage and catapult connections for remote regions . And so we 've really started to build off that as well with building digital twins and all of the different things that we 're doing at our refineries , and then also on our rigs and platforms that will capitalize on just the cloud-based technology . So , there 's quite a few things that we 're seeing that are trending , but things that we 're already in the works with and moving towards . And the last one is just the evolution of the CIO that we 're seeing . The CIO seems to have gone away . I do n't see a lot of CIO titles anymore that are out there . And we definitely have moved away from that , as well as the way our organization is structured . And as I said earlier , aligning a lot more with product led organizations and making sure that we have technology leaders that are elevating their financial acumen , along with business prioritizations and outcomes , and bringing that business value and finding where those value streams are within your business strategies and aligning to those , and then evaluating and bringing about the technology that will be the catalyst and a differentiator for most businesses , and definitely ours . Laurel : That 's quite a bit . And you mentioned this a little bit earlier , but how do you actually bring together a company to maintain and manage and optimize all of those business practices in the cloud ? What are some of those best practices companies should be thinking about in order to collaborate and deploy cloud technologies ? Keisha : I think the biggest thing that we are seeing , or that I saw that were best practices and lessons learned and things , is just providing clear stakeholder communications . If you do n't have your business on board and understand what it is that you 're doing and why you 're doing it and what 's in it for them , it 's going to be hard . It 's going to be really , really hard to do a mass migration as we have , an adoption of cloud , the way that we have . And I hate that covid-19 happened , but it definitely forced the business to really see the benefit because we were pretty much about , I want to say 50 % on the cloud by the time , probably a little less than 50 % on the cloud , by the time covid hit , but we were on the cloud for our major things . And our business really did n't skip a beat really with being able to connect from anywhere in the world . And so they saw the benefit of that . They saw some of the things that we had talked about . But just having that clear outline of communication around what you will get , what you do n't get , where you will be in each part of the journey , I can not express how important that it was to do that . Involve application teams , service owners , end users early in the development and delivery of the strategy . Again , just bringing everyone along for the journey , I can not overstate how important that is . Modify your operating model , your digital operating model specifically to align so that you 're working more seamlessly together across different areas and allowing for the breakdown of expertise in particular areas and having that focus on that expertise and continuing to develop that and evolve that . Because technology , as always , but definitely in this space , changes extremely quickly . And so therefore , you have got to ensure that your people are getting as educated , updated with the skill sets as possible . And building on the benefits , a realization plan , was also key . So those are some of the softer ones that I would think that people might overlook . Other ones , just the hybrid approach that we had , the hybrid approach to transformation . We recognized early on the need for a hybrid approach , combining our cloud migration with the retention of certain applications , dedicated data centers , intermediary migration environments , allowing for cost effective and secure operations . Those are some of the best practices as far as just how we were going to transform and what that looks like , and not thinking that it 's a one size fits all and being able to assess your estate , what 's best if you have a large in the service of life estate , a legacy estate , as we did where we were legacy with operating model—the code base on our applications across our entire landscape , it was huge . I think when we first started this journey , a good amount of over 60 % of our estate was in the end of the service of a life due to one of one or the other of the things that I just mentioned . And so instead of trying to tackle those separately , we decided , what 's the best way for us to leverage and bring that all together ? So being flexible and looking at the art of the possible across your state and what you have to do to address multiple things was also really a great way to look at this as well . Because you and I probably know from experience , just any time that you say that you 're going to go back and do something , nine times out of 10 , you do n't . You do the first tactical thing and it stays that way forever . So it was , for me , a good thing for us to take best practice , to , if we only have to do something once or only have to open up the box once , then let 's just open it up once and figure out how much of transformation can we do in one time to keep us at ease , but also to cover as much modernization as we can before we hand them back over to our ops teams . I think I 've already touched on just CIO buy-in and business buy-in . Those are best practices , some of those things that were softer that I mentioned earlier . Having a governance framework , delivery model restructured for effectiveness , and how do you get things approved and establish those things , again , upfront , having that delivery model to ensure smooth cloud migrations while also ensuring business service continuity and accommodating evolving business requirements ? Because as you know , again , with some of the trends that we talked about or that I mentioned earlier , those trends are things that when you start to go and implement those things , the business change is enormous . And so being able to be flexible to accommodate those , but not being beared down by who needs to approve this , who 's making this decision . If you establish those things upfront with a good governance framework and a delivery model that allows for that flexibility and effectiveness , then that was also key and golden . The collaboration with digital delivery partners . I ca n't express enough finding great delivery partners . There 's no way that knowledge is known by everyone in your organization . And like I said , given the pace at which technology changes and things are being rolled out , you always need people that are also keeping their fingers on the pulse from learnings and different experiences . And so you can only get that sometimes if you also worked externally with external partners . And we had a couple of them , quite a few of them actually , that proved to be very , very great partners . And we all learned together with several of the others , but Emphasis has been a major partner of ours . We had eight vendor partners to supplement in-house capabilities , and it was great . Adapting modern ways of working , agility . And agility in its simplest forms , but also just being agile and utilizing agile practices , which will help you move much faster , setting up your squads , those types of things . And then of course , I 'll say it again , last one , but communication , communication , communication , and training for sustainability and just continuing to build your knowledge base to be able to continue to support the platforms and the new technology that 's coming on board . So those are some of the things that we saw , or that 's lessons learned , best practices in general . Laurel : You mentioned this a little bit earlier , but how critical is talent to that kind of cloud transformation ? And what are some of techniques–communication clearly–for recruiting and refining talent for adopting cloud technologies ? Keisha : Yeah . Given the fact that , as we talked , there 's so many people that are going along this journey , some at the very beginning , some middle , some almost nearing the end . But because of that , the market out there is extremely competitive to get great talent . And then also , just upscaling your talent that you have in the door already . Your existing staff is also critical . So , offering a competitive compensation package , as well as providing training and certification opportunities . Because again , it 's keeping your employees motivated and keeping them focused on being a hundred percent all in and passionate around what we 're doing and why we 're doing it , but also recognizing that people have to enjoy what they do . And the compensation package has to be great . And also , the learning opportunities and promoting a learning culture has to be there because that 's what people are looking for . As we see , as people are moving from place to place , in order to retain great talent , in order to attract great talent , all of those offerings need to be there . They 're important . They 're important for the success of any transformation program that you 're doing for some of the reasons that I touched on earlier , the pace at which technology moves , as well as the fact that everybody is out doing all of these things to test the waters , and to also create a more sustainable environment , to also create , to be able to get to market faster , to create all the different trends that are happening with people working in different spaces and places across the globe . All of those things , the offerings have to be there to attract that talent . But most of all , also building a diverse and inclusive workforce . And in order to do that , the offering has to be there across the board for people that want to work from home , people that want to work in an office building , people that are doing different things or at different stages and points in their lives . Having that flexibility to offer your employees to retain that great talent is absolutely key and critical for the purposes of the success of your transformation . Laurel : And then you did mention the importance of working with partners , especially when you 're trying to build this collaborative ecosystem . So , what is that like working with partners in this large-scale cloud transformation ? Keisha : Again , you ca n't know everything , and you 're not always going to get all of those things . So that 's where you have the extension of , I would say an extension of additional brain power , extension of learning and those things . Leveraging partnerships with educational institutions , collaborating with universities and colleges to establish internships , co-op programs , and recruitment pipelines for cloud related roles . Because again , as you see in universities , technology is key and they 're learning new things . And students coming out of universities , they 're more conscious of all of the things that are going on in the environment , and they 're wanting to work with people that are moving towards making the environment better and the sustainability of that . And the low carbon initiatives that are going on and getting to net zero , believe it or not , those are all things that are known . As soon as I go into recruiting at a university , it 's the first thing that they ask . What 's really going on with re : Invent ? What do you see and how do you utilize technology to help leverage that ? So I think building those partnerships with educational institutions are great , as well as those partnerships with our third-party vendors that we 've done as well , because they 're doing some of the same things with getting students , and as well as keeping up with the trends , keeping up their skillsets and capabilities and being able to have that flex staff to flex up and down as necessary . As you go through the ebb and flows of your journey of transformation , things start , stop , and/or increase , and sometimes you need to move at pace , or just the complexities that comes with marrying things with moving off of your legacy estate and still trying to keep that BAU [ business as usual ] and no downtime for your business . So therefore , all of those things , you can not know within one organization . You have to look to research and development . And again , the partnerships with the universities , the partnerships with third-party vendors are absolutely critical and key . Laurel : You 've mentioned sustainability a couple times . So how moving to the cloud and adopting these kinds of emerging technologies actually help BP as a company address the sustainability goals that it may have ? Keisha : We have the reduced environmental impact paired with efficient resource utilization . So , moving to the cloud allowed us to reduce our carbon footprint by transitioning from on-premise data centers to a more energy efficient cloud infrastructure . We are dual cloud company . We use both AWS and Microsoft Azure . And so definitely working with both of them for what they 're doing around the energy efficient cloud infrastructure that they 're pushing and doing , and working with them on all hands of how to measure that . Also what 's the projection of what we 're going to contribute as we continue to move forward and get to nearing the end of our cloud journey . Also enabling us to optimize our energy consumption , like I said , by scaling resources up and down based on demand , driving efficient energy usage , reducing waste , and contributing to our wider BP sustainability goals as well . There was a time , again , when we were on-prem and we would have large amounts of servers running . And some of those servers were literally less than 50 % utilized . But yet they 're still on . They 're still utilizing energy as well . So this moving to cloud allows us , again , from the optimization perspective of what we consume . Also , low carbon emissions , data-driven sustainability , and enhanced operational efficiency . Moving to the cloud supports and drives our low carbon emission by enabling our company to utilize renewable power sources , so by adopting emerging technologies , such as AI and machine learning . The transformation to cloud allows for us to analyze vast amounts of data , driving our innovation and decision-making power for BP 's sustainable initiatives . And again , this has been huge for us . And being data-driven helps identify opportunities for resource optimization , emissions reduction , as well as environmental impact mitigation . So in the data space , large opportunities there . And then also , there 's just a continuous improvement in innovation , and having or utilizing cloud platforms provides the necessary computational power and tools to implement advanced analytics , predictive modeling , as well as simulation techniques , which also enables us to continuously improve our sustainability performance . And it also allows for new solutions to be provided , as well as to contribute to all of the industry-wide sustainability advancements , things that when I get around other CIO tables or other tables with other people that are leading their transformations , we share ideas , we talk about the things that we 're doing , how we 're measuring that . And sharing that across the table is really good because , again , you get to also hear some of the things that they 're doing , which gives you some of the ideas of how they 're using technology to continue with the sustainability goals . So from that standpoint , that 's how we 've helped to leverage our cloud transformation to help with our sustainability aspirations of getting to net zero . Laurel : Yeah , that 's quite significant . You 've outlined major cloud trends like going cloud native that you 're seeing today . So , what are some of the cloud-enabled technologies or use cases that you 're really excited to see emerge in the next three to five years ? Keisha : So , I would say that I 'm really excited about ... there 's quite a few , so I 'll try and limit it . So edge AI . I think that the convergence of edge computing and AI presents an exciting opportunity for the real-time data , a real-time low latency processing and decision making at the network edge , which is extremely critical for us , given all of the platforms , rigs , that we have out across the globe . That is absolutely key . And I 'm excited about that because this technology helps to enable and develop our innovative applications in our industry to optimize the energy consumption of smart grids and enhance predictive maintenance and our operations . So for me , edge AI is really one that I 'm excited about . Also , quantum computing . It has the potential to solve complex problems and perform computations that are currently infeasible for classical computers . So in the next three to five years , I 'd expect to see significant progress in quantum computing technology , which has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach computational challenges and drive innovation across multiple sectors of our business , but multiple sectors of the energy industry in general . And then I 'll probably think of a couple more . I would say things have progressed quite far along in this space , but IoT and integration and analytics in that space , the proliferation of IoT devices continues to generate massive volumes of data . So cloud platforms will play a crucial role in processing , analyzing , and extracting meaningful insights from this data . In the next few years , and currently even today , I think we see further advancements in cloud based IoT integration analytics , as well as enabling US or other organizations to harness the full potential of IoT data , which will drive smarter decision making and predictive maintenance , as well as asset optimization and automation , or optimization rather . So I just think from an IoT perspective , again , big driver . We 've been doing digital twins , we 've been doing quite a few things within our platforms and just within our production business . Those are some of the three that really excite me . And then of course , there 's augmented reality , but I wo n't go into that . But there 's a few things that are coming along that really excite us and will be driving our business forward . Laurel : Fantastic .

How software that tracks covid variants could protect us against future outbreaks,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/09/12/1078357/yatish-turakhia-covid-variants-tracing/,2023-09-12,"<p>During the pandemic, Yatish Turakhia developed software tools to trace the evolution of new covid variants. Now he’s applying his techniques to other diseases.</p>
","Yatish Turakhia is one of MIT Technology Review’s 2023 Innovators Under 35.  When covid-19 started spreading in early 2020, scientists quickly realized that tracking how the virus was mutating would be essential for public health as new strains emerged that put people at greater risk. Yatish Turakhia, then a postdoc at UC Santa Cruz’s Genomics Institute, helped develop a software tool called UShER to track these covid variants by placing them, within minutes of each new sample’s submission, on a family tree of all known SARS-CoV-2 genomes.  The tool, which has been accessible online since 2021, now records more than 15 million viral sequences, and scientists add to it daily. It helps them and public health officials discover new strains, assign them names, and track their evolution. It also allows them to surveil the virus in real time on a global scale with a high degree of precision. More recently, the team built another software tool, called RIPPLES, which examines UShER’s extensive family tree structure and investigates whether specific “branches” of variants may be recombinants—genetically distinct hybrid variants. A recombinant could, for example, take one part of its genome from the delta variant and another part from omicron. Because they essentially have two “parents,” recombinants are both rarer and tougher to identify.  Before the development of RIPPLES, scientists’ only method of identifying potential recombinants was by remembering mutations they’d spotted in other variants. RIPPLES automates that process, allowing health experts to reconstruct the virus’s evolutionary history. It also helps them work out whether a previously unseen sequence is a truly independent mutation or a combination of existing variants.  Tips for aspiring innovators on trying, failing, and the future of AI. “Our global understanding of how covid spreads would have been severely compromised without Yatish’s work,” says David Haussler, scientific director of the UCSC Genomics Institute, who worked with Turakhia on the project. “The product of his algorithm, which nobody else could make, is a global picture of how the virus spread in full genetic detail around the entire globe.” Since the tool’s release in 2022, RIPPLES has helped reveal hundreds of new SARS-CoV-2 recombinants. “I just started working on it during the pandemic solely because I wanted to be useful,” says Turakhia, 31. “Now, when we get a new sequence, people have already used UShER to train models that can predict whether that new variant will be more transmissible and more immune-invasive than omicron or not, just based on this big data that is available.” While both tools were born from the need to track covid, they could also help scientists handle outbreaks of other pathogens. Turakhia and his team are already using it to track respiratory syncytial virus, also known as RSV, and monkeypox. Soon they plan to add tuberculosis and flu. Both infections are tough to track. Their strains are more genetically diverse than those of most diseases, and tuberculosis also has a much larger genome because it’s a bacterium. But the team is already seeing promising results, says Turakhia. “In the future, we are going to create tools which are basically generalized to any pathogen out there—that’s basically our goal,” he adds. “We want to manage the pathogens better, and to develop vaccines that are more reactive to how the pathogens are evolving, and thereby save lives.”  Yatish Turakhia is one of MIT Technology Review’s 2023 Innovators Under 35.

The beautiful complexity of the US radio spectrum,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/23/1077686/radio-spectrum-visualized/,2023-08-23,"<p>The United States Frequency Allocation Chart shows how the nation’s precious radio frequencies are carefully shared.</p>
","Somewhere above you right now, a plane is broadcasting its coordinates on 1090 megahertz. A satellite high above Earth is transmitting weather maps on 1694.1 MHz. On top of all that, every single phone and Wi-Fi router near you blasts internet traffic through the air over radio waves. A carefully regulated radio spectrum is what makes it possible for these signals to get to the right place intact. The Federal Communication Commis-sion and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration share  the task of managing radio frequencies for US airwaves. The NTIA manages all federal radio uses (including military use), while the FCC manages everything else. It is an incredibly complex system, and to help with the job of explaining the importance of managing this invisible natural resource, the NTIA  publishes the United States Frequency Allocation Chart (which you can order as a wall chart for $6). The US government lays claim to a large chunk of spectrum for military use, communications, and transportation. FM radio operates between 88 and 108.0 MHz, and AM radio operates between 540 and 1700 kilohertz. Using licenses, amateur radio operators are granted slices where they can communicate safely, as are businesses and other institutions. Civil aviation, maritime navigation, satellite communications, radio astronomy, cellular voice, and data all lay claim to colorful plots on this chart. The chart uses 33 color-coded categories to visualize the information in a crazy quilt of blocks (some wide, some narrow), spread from 9 kHz (very low frequency) all the way to 300 GHz (extremely high frequency). It does suffer from scale distortions, not unlike a map of Earth. Eric Rosenberg, a telecommunications specialist at NTIA, says a lot of the choices about what service goes where come down to physics and the environment where the service will be used: “You can’t just pick up a block and say, okay, we’re gonna move these radars over here.” The chart is always extremely popular, Rosenberg says; fans include lawmakers in Congress. Last updated in 2016, it is due for another revision. “We’re getting to the point where we really feel that we need to redo it,” he says. “Again, it’s a very large project.” ν A version of this story appeared on Beautiful Public Data (beautifulpublicdata.com), a newsletter by Jon Keegan (KE3GAN).

"How culture drives foul play on the internet, and how new “upcode” can protect us",https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/23/1077693/crypto-foul-play/,2023-08-23,"<p>Three new books explore the various scams, frauds, and hacks that plague online life.</p>
","The world of online misdeeds is an eerie biome, crawling with Bored Apes, Fancy Bears, Shiba Inu coins, self-­replicating viruses, and whales. But the behavior driving fraud, hacks, and scams on the internet has always been familiar and very human. New technologies change little about the fact that illegal operations exist because some people are willing to act illegally and others fall for the stories they tell.  The crypto industry is investing heavily in getting more people to buy in. That doesn't mean you have to. To wit: Crypto speculation looks a lot like online sports betting, which looks like offline sports betting; cyber hacking resembles classic espionage; spear phishers recall flesh-and-blood con artists. The perpetrators of these crimes lure victims with well-worn appeals to faith and promises of financial reward. In Fancy Bear Goes Phishing, Yale law professor Scott Shapiro argues that technological solutions can’t solve the problem because they can’t force people to play nice online. The best ways to protect ourselves from online tricks are social—public policies, legal and business incentives, and cultural shifts.  Shapiro’s book arrives just in time for the last gasp of the latest crypto wave, as major players find themselves trapped in the nets of human institutions. In early June, the US Securities and Exchange Commission went after Binance and Coinbase, the two largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, a few months after charging the infamous Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the massive crypto exchange FTX, with fraud. While Shapiro mentions crypto only as the main means of payment in online crime, the industry’s wild ride through finance and culture deserves its own hefty chapter in the narrative of internet fraud.  It may be too early for deep analysis, but we do have first-person perspectives on crypto from actor Ben McKenzie (former star of the teen drama The O.C.) and streetwear designer and influencer Bobby Hundreds, the authors of—respectively—Easy Money and NFTs Are a Scam/NFTs Are the Future. (More heavily reported books on the crypto era from tech reporter Zeke Faux and Big Short author Michael Lewis are in the works.)  “If we are committing serious crimes like fraud, it is crucially important that we find ways to justify our behavior to others, and crucially, to ourselves.” McKenzie testified at the Senate Banking Committee’s hearing on FTX that he believes the cryptocurrency industry “represents the largest Ponzi scheme in history,” and Easy Money traces his own journey from bored pandemic dabbler to committed crypto critic alongside the industry’s rise and fall. Hundreds also writes a chronological account of his time in crypto—specifically in nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, digital representational objects that he has bought, sold, and “dropped” on his own and through The Hundreds, a “community-based streetwear brand and media company.” For Hundreds, NFTs have value as cultural artifacts, and he’s not convinced that their time should be over (although he acknowledges that between 2019 and the writing of his book, more than $100 million worth of NFTs have been stolen, mostly through phishing scams). “Whether or not NFTs are a scam poses a philosophical question that wanders into moral judgments and cultural practices around free enterprise, mercantilism, and materialism,” he writes.  For all their differences (a lawyer, an actor, and a designer walk into a bar …), Shapiro, McKenzie, and Hundreds all explore characters, motivations, and social dynamics much more than they do technical innovations. Online crime is a human story, these books collectively argue, and explanations of why it happens, why it works, and how we can stay safe are human too. To articulate how internet crime comes to be, Shapiro offers a new paradigm for the relationship between humanity and technology. He relabels technical computer code “downcode” and calls everything human surrounding and driving it “upcode.” From “the inner operations of the human brain” to “the outer social, political, and institutional forces that define the world,” upcode is the teeming ecosystem of humans and human systems behind the curtain of technology. Shapiro argues that upcode is responsible for all of technology’s impacts—positive and negative—and downcode is only its product. Technical tools like the blockchain, firewalls, or two-factor authentication may be implemented as efforts to ensure safety online, but they cannot address the root causes upstream. For any technologist or crypto enthusiast who believes computer code to be law and sees human error as an annoying hiccup, this idea may be disconcerting. But crime begins and ends with humans, Shapiro argues, so upcode is where we must focus both our blame for the problem and our efforts to improve online safety. McKenzie and Hundreds deal with crypto and NFTS almost entirely at the upcode level: neither has training in computer science, and both examine the industry through personal lenses. For McKenzie, it’s the financial realm, where friends encouraged him to invest in tokens to compensate for being out of work during the pandemic. For Hundreds, it’s the art world, which has historically been inaccessible to most and inhospitable for many—and is what led him to gravitate toward streetwear as a creative outlet in the first place. Hundreds saw NFTs as a signal of a larger positive shift toward Web3, a nebulous vision of a more democratized form of the internet where creative individuals could get paid for their work and build communities of fans and artists without relying on tech companies. The appeal of Web3 and NFTs is based in cultural and economic realities; likewise, online scams happen because buggy upcode—like social injustice, runaway capitalism, and corporate monopolies—creates the conditions.   Constructing downcode guardrails to allow in only “good” intentions won’t solve online crime because bad acts are not so easily dismissed as the work of bad actors. The people who perpetrate scams, fraud, and hacks—or even participate in the systems around it, like speculative markets—often subscribe to a moral rubric as they act illegally. In Fancy Bear, Shapiro cites the seminal research of Sarah Gordon, the first to investigate the psychology of people who wrote computer viruses when this malware first popped up in the 1990s. Of the 64 respondents to her global survey, all but one had developmentally appropriate moral reasoning based on ethics, according to a framework created by the psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg: that is, these virus writers made decisions based on a sense of right and wrong. More recent research from Alice Hutchings, the director of the University of Cambridge’s Cybercrime Centre, also found hackers as a group to be “moral agents, possessing a sense of justice, purpose, and identity.” Many hackers find community in their work; others, like Edward Snowden, who leaked classified information from the US National Security Agency in 2013, cross legal boundaries for what they believe to be expressly moral reasons. Bitcoin, meanwhile, may be a frequent agent of crime but was in fact created to offer a “trustless” way to avoid relying on banks after the housing crisis and government bailouts of the 2000s left many wondering if traditional financial institutions could be trusted with consumer interests. The definition of crime is also upcode, shaped by social contracts as well as legal ones. In NFTs Are a Scam/NFTs Are the Future, Hundreds interviews the renowned tech investor and public speaker Gary Vaynerchuk, or “Gary Vee,” a figure he calls the “face of NFTs.” It was Vee’s “zeal and belief” that convinced Hundreds to create his own NFT collection, Adam Bomb Squad. Vee tells Hundreds that critics “may be right” when they call NFTs a scam. But while some projects may be opportunistic rackets, he hopes the work he makes is the variety that endures. Vee might be lying here, but at face value, he professes a belief in a greater good that he and everyone he recruits (including the thousands of attendees at his NFT convention) can help build—even if there’s harm along the way.  McKenzie spends much of two chapters in Easy Money describing his personal encounters with FTX’s Bankman-Fried, who was widely called the “King of Crypto” before his fall. Bankman-Fried professes to believe in crypto’s positive potential; indeed, he has claimed on the record many times that he wanted to do good with his work, despite knowing at points that it was potentially fraudulent. McKenzie struggles to understand this point of view. “If we are committing serious crimes like fraud,” he speculates, “it is crucially important that we find ways to justify our behavior to others and crucially, to ourselves.” While this rationalization certainly doesn’t excuse any crimes, it explains how people can perpetrate eye-boggling fraud again and again, even inventing new ways to scam. The human upcode that makes each of us see ourselves as the protagonist of our story is powerful, even and maybe especially when billions of dollars are at stake.  Technological innovation does not change our fundamental behavior as humans, but technology has brought speed and spread to the gambling table. A single perpetrator can reach more victims faster now that the global world is connected. Despite his research, McKenzie did gamble on crypto—he shorted tokens on a specific, and incorrect, timeline. He doesn’t disclose how much he lost, but it was an amount that “provokes an uncomfortable conversation with your spouse.” He’s hardly the only savvy individual in history to fall for a risky pitch; our brains make it painfully easy to get scammed, another reason why solutions that rely entirely on computer code don’t work. “The human mind is riddled with upcode that causes us to make biased predictions and irrational choices,” Shapiro writes. Take the “representativeness heuristic,” which leads us to judge something by how much it resembles an existing mental image—even if that may lead us to overlook crucial information. If an animal looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, the representativeness heuristic tells us it can swim. Phishing scams rely on this rush to pattern matching. For example, Fancy Bear, the titular Russian hacking group of Shapiro’s book, used a visually and tonally convincing message to attempt to hack into Hillary Clinton campaign staffers’ email accounts in 2016. It worked.  Also coming into play for scams, fraud, and hacks are the “availability heuristic,” which leads us to remember sensational events regardless of their frequency, and the “affect heuristic,” which leads us to emphasize our feelings about a decision over the facts, inflating “our expectations about outcomes we like”—such as winning a huge payout on a gamble. When Hundreds was concerned about whether NFTs were a good investment, he reached out to a friend whose belief was steadfast and found himself calmed. “It was that sense of conviction that separated the losers from the winners,” he writes, even when the facts might have supported stepping back.  The marketing pitch of communal faith and reward, the enticement to join a winning team, feeds a human social instinct—especially as more offline modes of connection are faltering. It’s telling that after the SEC brought charges against Coinbase, the company responded by issuing a pro-crypto NFT, imploring its community to offer support for the struggling industry by minting it. (Coinbase and the minting platform Zora promise to donate the mint fees they’ll receive from consumers to pro-crypto advocacy.) The crypto industry rose to power on this kind of faith-based relationship, and it continues to appeal to some: more than 135,000 of the Coinbase tokens have been minted since the SEC suit was announced. Beyond money, “we’re just as motivated by identity and community (or its upside-down cousin, tribalism),” writes Hundreds, “and the most fervent contemporary movements and trends masterfully meld them all together. The only thing that feels as good as getting rich is doing so by rallying around an impassioned cause with a band of like-minded friends.” Technological innovation does not change our fundamental behavior as humans, but technology has brought speed and spread to the gambling table. A single perpetrator can reach more victims faster now that the global world is connected. The risks are higher now, as clearly demonstrated by the headline-exploding results of the 2016 Clinton email hack, the billions lost by investors in the volatile crypto industry, and billions more lost through crypto hacks and scams. Shapiro argues that the efforts of the antivirus and antihacking industry to code guardrails into our online systems have failed. Fraud goes on. Instead, we must reexamine the upcode that has fostered and supported online crimes: “our settled moral and political convictions on what we owe one another and how we should respect security and privacy.” For Shapiro, effectively addressing online fraud, hacks, and scams requires political, economic, and social shifts such as creating incentives for businesses to protect customers and penalties for data breaches, supporting potential hackers in finding community outside of crime, and developing government and legal policies to prevent illicit payment through mechanisms like cryptocurrencies.  Shapiro admits that shifting upcode this way will likely take generations, but the work has already started. The SEC’s recent moves against crypto exchanges are promising steps, as are the FTC’s public warnings against scammy AI claims and generative AI fraud. Growing public awareness about the importance of data privacy and security will help too. But while some humans are working on evolving our social systems, others will continue to hunt online for other people’s money. In our lifetimes, fraud, hacks, and scams will likely always find a home on the internet. But being aware of the upcode all around us may help us find safer paths through the online jungle.  Rebecca Ackermann is a writer and artist in San Francisco.

How ubiquitous keyboard software puts hundreds of millions of Chinese users at risk,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/21/1078207/sogou-keyboard-app-security-loophole/,2023-08-21,"<p>Third-party keyboard apps make typing in Chinese more efficient, but they can also be a privacy nightmare.</p>
","For millions of Chinese people, the first software they download on a new laptop or smartphone is always the same: a keyboard app. Yet few of them are aware that it may make everything they type vulnerable to spying eyes. Since dozens of Chinese characters can share the same latinized phonetic spelling, the ordinary QWERTY keyboard alone is incredibly inefficient. A smart, localized keyboard app can save a lot of time and frustration by predicting the characters and words a user wants to type. Today, over 800 million Chinese people use third-party keyboard apps on their PCs, laptops, and mobile phones.  But a recent report by the Citizen Lab, a University of Toronto–affiliated research group focused on technology and security, revealed that Sogou, one of the most popular Chinese keyboard apps, had a massive security loophole. “This is an app that handles very sensitive information—specifically, every single thing that you type,” says Jeffrey Knockel, a senior research associate at the Citizen Lab and coauthor of the report. “So we wanted to look into that in greater detail and see if this app is properly encrypting this very sensitive data that it’s sending over the network—or, as we found, is it improperly doing it in a way that eavesdroppers could decipher?”  Indeed, what he and his colleagues found was that Sogou’s encryption system could be exploited to intercept and decrypt exactly what people were typing, as they were typing it.  Sogou, which was acquired by the tech giant Tencent in 2021, quickly fixed this loophole after the Citizen Lab researchers disclosed it to the company.  “User privacy is fundamental to our business,” a Sogou spokesperson told MIT Technology Review. “We have addressed the issues identified by the Citizen Lab and will continue to work so that user data remains safe and secure. We transparently disclose our data processing activities in our privacy policy and do not otherwise share user data.” But there’s no guarantee that this was the only vulnerability in the app, and the researchers did not examine other popular keyboard apps in the Chinese market—meaning the ubiquitous software will continue to be a security risk for hundreds of millions of people. And, alarmingly, the potential for such makes otherwise encrypted communications by Chinese users—in apps like Signal, for example—vulnerable to systems of state surveillance. Officially called input method editors (IMEs), keyboard apps are necessary for typing in languages that have more characters than a common Latin-alphabet keyboard allows, like those with Japanese, Korean, or Indic characters. For Chinese users, having an IME is almost a necessity.  “There’s a lot more ambiguity to resolve when typing Chinese characters using a Latin alphabet,” says Mona Wang, an Open Technology Fund fellow at the Citizen Lab and another coauthor of the report. Because the same phonetic spelling can be matched to dozens or even hundreds of Chinese characters, and these characters also can be paired in different ways to become different words, a keyboard app that has been fine-tuned to the Chinese language can perform much better than the default keyboard. More than 40 years ago, designers drew and edited thousands of characters by hand to make it possible to type and print in Chinese. Starting in the PC era, Chinese software developers proposed all kinds of IME products to expedite typing, some even ditching phonetic spelling and allowing users to draw or choose the components of a Chinese character. As a result, downloading third-party keyboard software became standard practice for everyone in China. Released in 2006, Sogou Input Method quickly became the most popular keyboard app in the country. It was more capable than any competitor in predicting which character or word the user actually wanted to type, and it did that by scraping text from the internet and maintaining an extensive library of Chinese words. The cloud-based library was updated frequently to include newly coined words, trending expressions, or names of people in the news. In 2007, when Google launched its Chinese keyboard, it even copied Sogou’s word library (and later had to apologize). In 2014, when the iPhone finally enabled third-party IMEs for the first time, Chinese users rushed to download Sogou’s keyboard app, leaving 3,000 reviews in just one day. At one point, over 90% of Chinese PC users were using Sogou. Over the years, its market dominance has waned; as of last year, Baidu Input Method was the top keyboard app in China, with 607 million users and 46.4% of the market share. But Sogou still had 561 million users, according to iiMedia, an analytics firm.  A keyboard app can access a wide variety of user information. For example, once Sogou is downloaded and added to the iPhone keyboard options, the app will ask for “full access.” If it’s granted, anything the user types can be sent to Sogou’s cloud-based server.  Connecting to the cloud is what makes most IMEs successful, allowing them to improve text prediction and enable other miscellaneous features, like the ability to search for GIFs and memes. But this also adds risk since content can, at least in theory, be intercepted during transmission.  It becomes the apps’ responsibility to properly encrypt the data and prevent that from happening. Sogou’s privacy policy says it has “adopted industry-standard security technology measures … to maximize the prevention of leak, destruction, misuse, unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, or alteration” of users’ personal information. “People generally had suspicions [about the security of keyboard apps] because they’re advertising [their] cloud service,” says Wang. “Almost certainly they’re sending some amount of keystrokes over the internet.”  Nevertheless, users have continued to grant the apps full access.  When the Citizen Lab researchers started looking at the Sogou Input Method on Windows, Android, and iOS platforms, they found that it used EncryptWall, an encryption system it developed itself, instead of Transport Layer Security (TLS), the standard international cryptographic protocol that has been in use since 1999. (Sogou is also used on other platforms like MacOS and Linux, but the researchers haven’t looked into them.) One critical difference between the two encryption systems, the Citizen Lab found, is that Sogou’s EncryptWall is still vulnerable to an exploit that was revealed in 2002 and can turn encrypted data back into plain text. TLS was updated to protect against this in 2003. But when they used that exploit method on Sogou, the researchers managed to decrypt the exact keystrokes they’d typed.  The existence of this loophole meant that users were vulnerable to all kinds of hacks. The typed content could be intercepted when it went through VPN software, home Wi-Fi routers, and telecom providers.  Not every word is transmitted to the cloud, the researchers found. “If you type in nihao [‘hello’ in Chinese] or something like that, [the app] can answer that without having to use the cloud database,” says Knockel. “But if it’s more complicated and, frankly, more interesting things that you’re typing in, it has to reach out to that cloud database.”  Along with the content being typed, Knockel and his Citizen Lab colleagues also obtained other information like technical identifiers of the user’s device, the app that the typing occurred in, and even a list of apps installed on the device. A lot of malicious actors would be interested in exploiting a loophole like this and eavesdropping on keystrokes, the researchers note—from cybercriminals after private information (like street addresses and bank account numbers) to government hackers.  (In a written response to the Citizen Lab, Sogou said the transmission of typed text is required to access more accurate and extensive vocabularies on the cloud and enable a built-in search engine, and the uses are stated in the privacy agreement.) This particular loophole was closed when Tencent updated the Sogou software across platforms in late July. The Citizen Lab researchers found that the latest version effectively fixed the problem by adopting the TLS encryption protocol.  Around the world, people who are at high risk of being surveilled by state authorities have turned to apps that offer end-to-end encryption. But if keyboard apps are vulnerable, then otherwise encrypted communication apps like Signal or WhatsApp are now also unsafe. What’s more, once a keyboard app is compromised, even an otherwise offline app, like the built-in notebook app, can be a security risk too.  (Signal and WhatsApp did not respond to MIT Technology Review’s requests for comment. A spokesperson from Baidu said, “Baidu Input Method consistently adheres to established security practice standards. As of now, there are no vulnerabilities related to [the encryption exploit Sogou was vulnerable to] within Baidu Input Method’s products.”) As early as 2019, Naomi Wu, a Shenzhen-based tech blogger known as SexyCyborg online, had sounded the alarm about the risk of using Chinese keyboard apps alongside Signal. “The Signal ‘fix’ is ‘Incognito Mode’ aka for the app to say ‘Pretty please don't read everything I type’ to the virtual keyboard and count on Google/random app makers to listen to the flag, and not be under court order to do otherwise,” she wrote in a 2019 Twitter thread. Since keyboard apps have no obligation to honor Signal’s request, “basically all hardware here is self-compromised 5 minutes out of the box,” she added.  Wu suspects that the use of Signal was the reason some Chinese student activists talking to foreign media were detained by the police in 2018.  In January 2021, Signal itself tried to clarify that its Incognito Keyboard feature (which only works for users on Android systems, which are more vulnerable than iOS) was not a foolproof privacy solution: “Keyboards and IME’s can ignore Android’s Incognito Keyboard flag. This Android system flag is a best effort, not a guarantee. It’s important to use a keyboard or IME that you trust. Signal cannot detect or prevent malware on your device,” the company added to its article on keyboard security. The recent Citizen Lab findings lend further support to Wu’s theory.  Lessons learned from China’s White Paper Protests. The security risk is particularly acute for users in China, since they are more likely to use keyboard apps and are under strict surveillance by their government. (Wu herself has disappeared from social media since the end of June, following a visit from police that was reportedly related to her online discussions of Signal and keyboard apps.)  Still, other governments seem to have been paying attention to vulnerabilities with encrypted data transmission as well. A 2012 document leaked by Edward Snowden, for instance, shows that the Five Eyes intelligence alliance—comprising Canada, the US, Britain, Australia, and New Zealand—had been discreetly exploiting a similar loophole in UC Browser, a popular Chinese program, to intercept certain transmissions.  Beyond being targeted by state actors, there are other ways keystroke information acquired via keyboard apps can be sold, leaked, or hacked. In 2021, it was reported that advertisers were able to access personal information through Sogou, as well as Baidu’s keyboard and similar apps, and use it to push customized ads. And in 2013, a loophole was found that made multimedia files that users uploaded and shared through Sogou searchable on Bing.  These security problems are not unique to Chinese apps. In 2016, users of SwiftKey, an IME that was acquired by Microsoft that year, found that the app was auto-filling other people’s email addresses and personal information, as a result of a bug with its cloud sync system. The following year, a virtual keyboard app accidentally leaked 31 million users’ personal data. Even though the specific loophole identified by the Citizen Lab was fixed quickly, given all these breaches, it feels somewhat inevitable that another security flaw in a keyboard app will be revealed soon.  As Knockel notes, using Sogou and similar apps always poses security risks, particularly in China, since all Chinese apps are legally required to surrender data if asked by the government.  “If that’s something that’s concerning to you,” he says, “you might also just reconsider using Sogou, period.” ","For millions of Chinese people , the first software they download on a new laptop or smartphone is always the same : a keyboard app .

The future of open source is still very much in flux,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/17/1077498/future-open-source/,2023-08-17,"<p>Free and open software have transformed the tech industry. But we still have a lot to work out to make them healthy, equitable enterprises.</p>
","When Xerox donated a new laser printer to the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1980, the company couldn’t have known that the machine would ignite a revolution. The printer jammed. And according to the 2002 book Free as in Freedom, Richard M. Stallman, then a 27-year-old programmer at MIT, tried to dig into the code to fix it. He expected to be able to: he’d done it with previous printers. The early decades of software development generally ran on a culture of open access and free exchange, where engineers could dive into each other’s code across time zones and institutions to make it their own or squash a few bugs. But this new printer ran on inaccessible proprietary software. Stallman was locked out—and enraged that Xerox had violated the open code-sharing system he’d come to rely on.  A few years later, in September 1983, Stallman released GNU, an operating system designed to be a free alternative to one of the dominant operating systems at the time: Unix. Stallman envisioned GNU as a means to fight back against the proprietary mechanisms, like copyright, that were beginning to flood the tech industry. The free-software movement was born from one frustrated engineer’s simple, rigid philosophy: for the good of the world, all code should be open, without restriction or commercial intervention.  Forty years later, tech companies are making billions on proprietary software, and much of the technology around us—from ChatGPT to smart thermostats—is inscrutable to everyday consumers. In this environment, Stallman’s movement may look like a failed values experiment crushed under the weight of commercial reality. But in 2023, the free and open-source software movement is not only alive and well; it has become a keystone of the tech industry.  Today, 96% of all code bases incorporate open-source software. GitHub, the biggest platform for the open-source community, is used by more than 100 million developers worldwide. The Biden administration’s Securing Open Source Software Act of 2022 publicly recognized open-source software as critical economic and security infrastructure. Even AWS, Amazon’s money-making cloud arm, supports the development and maintenance of open-source software; it committed its portfolio of patents to an open use community in December of last year. Over the last two years, while public trust in private technology companies has plummeted, organizations including Google, Spotify, the Ford Foundation, Bloomberg, and NASA have established new funding for open-source projects and their counterparts in open science efforts—an extension of the same values applied to scientific research. The fact that open-source software is now so essential means that long-standing leadership and diversity issues in the movement have become everyone’s problems. Many open-source projects began with “benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL) models of governance, where original founders hang on to leadership for years—and not always responsibly. Stallman and some other BDFLs have been criticized by their own communities for misogynistic or even abusive behavior. Stallman stepped down as president of the Free Software Foundation in 2019 (although he returned to the board two years later). Overall, open-source participants are still overwhelmingly white, male, and located in the Global North. Projects can be overly influenced by corporate interests. Meanwhile, the people doing the hard work of keeping critical code healthy are not consistently funded. In fact, many major open-source projects still operate almost completely on volunteer steam. Greater access to the code behind generative models is fueling innovation. But if top companies get spooked, they could close up shop. Challenges notwithstanding, there’s plenty to celebrate in 2023, the year of GNU’s 40th birthday. The modern open-source movement persists as a collaborative haven for transparent ways of working within a highly fragmented and competitive industry. Selena Deckelmann, chief product and technology officer at the Wikimedia Foundation, says the power of open source lies in its “idea that people anywhere can collaborate together on software, but also on many [more] things.” She points out that tools to put this philosophy into action, like mailing lists, online chat, and open version control systems, were pioneered in open-source communities and have been adopted as standard practice by the wider tech industry. “We found a way for people from all over the world, regardless of background, to find a common cause to collaborate with each other,” says Kelsey Hightower, an early contributor to Kubernetes, an open-source system for automating app deployment and management, who recently retired from his role as a distinguished engineer at Google Cloud. “I think that is pretty unique to the world of open source.”  The 2010s backlash against tech’s unfettered growth, and the recent AI boom, have focused a spotlight on the open-source movement’s ideas about who has the right to use other people’s information online and who benefits from technology. Clement Delangue, CEO of the open-source AI company Hugging Face, which was recently valued at $4 billion, testified before Congress in June of 2023 that “ethical openness” in AI development could help make organizations more compliant and transparent, while allowing researchers beyond a few large tech companies access to technology and progress. “We’re in a unique cultural moment,” says Danielle Robinson, executive director of Code for Science and Society, a nonprofit that provides funding and support for public-interest technology. “People are more aware than ever of how capitalism has been influencing what technologies get built, and whether you have a choice to interact with it.” Once again, free and open-source software have become a natural home for the debate about how technology should be. The early days of the free-software movement were fraught with arguments about the meaning of “free.” Stallman and the Free Software Foundation (FSF), founded in 1985, held firm to the idea of four freedoms: people should be allowed to run a program for any purpose, study how it works from the source code and change it to meet their needs, redistribute copies, and distribute modified versions too. Stallman saw free software as an essential right: “Free as in free speech, not free beer,” as his apocryphal slogan goes. He created the GNU General Public License, what’s known as a “copyleft” license, to ensure that the four freedoms were protected in code built with GNU. Linus Torvalds, the Finnish engineer who in 1991 created the now ubiquitous Unix alternative Linux, didn’t buy into this dogma. Torvalds and others, including Microsoft’s Bill Gates, believed that the culture of open exchange among engineers could coexist with commerce, and that more-restrictive licenses could forge a path toward both financial sustainability and protections for software creators and users. It was during a 1998 strategic meeting of free-software advocates—which notably did not include Stallman—that this pragmatic approach became known as “open source.” (The term was coined and introduced to the group not by an engineer, but by the futurist and nano­technology scholar Christine Peterson.)  Karen Sandler, executive director of the Software Freedom Conservancy, a nonprofit that advocates for free and open-source software, saw firsthand how the culture shifted from orthodoxy to a big-tent approach with room for for-profit entities when she worked as general counsel at the Software Freedom Law Center in the early 2000s. “The people who were ideological—some of them stayed quite ideological. But many of them realized, oh, wait a minute, we can get jobs doing this. We can do well by doing good,” Sandler remembers. By leveraging the jobs and support that early tech companies were offering, open-source contributors could sustain their efforts and even make a living doing what they believed in. In that manner, companies using and contributing to free and open software could expand the community beyond volunteer enthusiasts and improve the work itself. “How could we ever make it better if it’s just a few radical people?” Sandler says.  As the tech industry grew around private companies like Sun Microsystems, IBM, Microsoft, and Apple in the late ’90s and early ’00s, new open-source projects sprang up, and established ones grew roots. Apache emerged as an open-source web server in 1995. Red Hat, a company offering enterprise companies support for open-source software like Linux, went public in 1999. GitHub, a platform originally created to support version control for open-source projects, launched in 2008, the same year that Google released Android, the first open-source phone operating system. The more pragmatic definition of the concept came to dominate the field. Meanwhile, Stallman’s original philosophy persisted among dedicated groups of believers—where it still lives today through nonprofits like FSF, which only uses and advocates for software that protects the four freedoms.  “If a company only ends up just sharing, and nothing more, I think that should be celebrated.” As open-source software spread, a bifurcation of the tech stack became standard practice, with open-source code as the support structure for proprietary work. Free and open-source software often served in the underlying foundation or back-end architecture of a product, while companies vigorously pursued and defended copyrights on the user-facing layers. Some estimate that Amazon’s 1999 patent on its one-click buying process was worth $2.4 billion per year to the company until it expired. It relied on Java, an open-source programming language, and other open-source software and tooling to build and maintain it. Today, corporations not only depend on open-source software but play an enormous role in funding and developing open-source projects: Kubernetes (initially launched and maintained at Google) and Meta’s React are both robust sets of software that began as internal solutions freely shared with the larger technology community. But some people, like the Software Freedom Conservancy’s Karen Sandler, identify an ongoing conflict between profit-­driven corporations and the public interest. “Companies have become so savvy and educated with respect to open-source software that they use a ton of it. That’s good,” says Sandler. At the same time, they profit from their proprietary work—which they sometimes attempt to pass off as open too, a practice the scholar and organizer Michelle Thorne dubbed “openwashing” in 2009. For Sandler, if companies don’t also make efforts to support user and creator rights, they’re not pushing forward the free and open-source ethos. And she says for the most part, that’s indeed not happening: “They’re not interested in giving the public any appreciable rights to their software.”  Others, including Kelsey Hightower, are more sanguine about corporate involvement. “If a company only ends up just sharing, and nothing more, I think that should be celebrated,” he says. “Then if for the next two years you allow your paid employees to work on it, maintaining the bugs and issues, but then down the road it’s no longer a priority and you choose to step back, I think we should thank [the company] for those years of contributions.”  In stark contrast, FSF, now in its 38th year, holds firm to its original ideals and opposes any product or company that does not support the ability for users to view, modify, and redistribute code. The group today runs public action campaigns like “End Software Patents,” publishing articles and submitting amicus briefs advocating the end of patents on software. The foundation’s executive director, Zoë Kooyman, hopes to continue pushing the conversation toward freedom rather than commercial concerns. “Every belief system or form of advocacy needs a far end,” she says. “That’s the only way to be able to drive the needle. [At FSF], we are that far end of the spectrum, and we take that role very seriously.”  Forty years on from the release of GNU, there is no singular open-source community, “any more than there is an ‘urban community,’” as researcher and engineer Nadia Asparouhova (formerly Eghbal) writes in her 2020 book Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software. There’s no singular definition, either. The Open Source Initiative (OSI) was founded in 1998 to steward the meaning of the phrase, but not all modern open-source projects adhere to the 10 specific criteria OSI laid out, and other definitions appear across communities. Scale, technology, social norms, and funding also range widely from project to project and community to community. For example, Kubernetes has a robust, organized community of tens of thousands of contributors and years of Google investment. Salmon is a niche open-source bioinformatics research tool with fewer than 50 contributors, supported by grants. OpenSSL, which encrypts an estimated 66% of the web, is currently maintained by 18 engineers compensated through donations and elective corporate contracts. The major discussions now are more about people than technology: What does healthy and diverse collaboration look like? How can those who support the code get what they need to continue the work? “How do you include a voice for all the people affected by the technology you build?” asks James Vasile, an open-source consultant and strategist who sits on the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “These are big questions. We’ve never grappled with them before. No one was working on this 20 years ago, because that just wasn’t part of the scene. Now it is, and we [in the open-source community] have the chance to consider these questions.” “We need designers, ethnographers, social and cultural experts. We need everyone to be playing a role in open source.” “Free as in puppy,” a phrase that can be traced back to 2006, has emerged as a valuable definition of “free” for modern open-source projects—one that speaks to the responsibilities of creators and users to each other and the software, in addition to their rights. Puppies need food and care to survive; open-source code needs funding and “maintainers,” individuals who consistently respond to requests and feedback from a community, fix bugs, and manage the growth and scope of a project. Many open-source projects have become too big, complicated, or important to be governed by one person or even a small group of like-minded individuals. And open-source contributors have their own needs and concerns, too. A person who’s good at building may not be good at maintaining; someone who creates a project may not want to or be able to run it indefinitely. In 2018, for instance, Guido van Rossum, the creator of the open-source programming language Python, stepped down from leadership after almost 30 years, exhausted from the demands of the mostly uncompensated role. “I’m tired,” he wrote in his resignation message to the community,  “and need a very long break.”  Supporting the people who create, maintain, and use free and open-source software requires new roles and perspectives. Whereas the movement in its early days was populated almost exclusively by engineers communicating across message boards and through code, today’s open-source projects invite participation from new disciplines to handle logistical work like growth and advocacy, as well as efforts toward greater inclusion and belonging. “We’ve shifted from open source being about just the technical stuff to the broader set of expertise and perspectives that are required to make effective open-source projects,” says Michael Brennan, senior program officer with the Technology and Society program at the Ford Foundation, which funds research into open internet issues. “We need designers, ethnographers, social and cultural experts. We need everyone to be playing a role in open source if it’s going to be effective and meet the needs of the people around the world.”  One powerful source of support arrived in 2008 with the launch of GitHub. While it began as a version control tool, it has grown into a suite of services, standards, and systems that is now the “highway system” for most open-source development, as Asparouhova puts it in Working in Public. GitHub helped lower the barrier to entry, drawing wider contribution and spreading best practices such as community codes of conduct. But its success has also given a single platform vast influence over communities dedicated to decentralized collaboration.  Demetris Cheatham, until recently GitHub’s senior director for diversity and inclusion strategy, took that responsibility very seriously. To find out where things stood, the company partnered with the Linux Foundation in 2021 on a survey and resulting report on diversity and inclusion within open source. The data showed that despite a pervasive ethos of collaboration and openness (more than 80% of the respondents reported feeling welcome), communities are dominated by contributors who are straight, white, male, and from the Global North. In response, Cheatham, who is now the company’s chief of staff, focused on ways to broaden access and promote a sense of belonging. GitHub launched All In for Students, a mentorship and education program with 30 students drawn primarily from historically Black colleges and universities. In its second year, the program expanded to more than 400 students.  Representation has not been the only stumbling block to a more equitable open-source ecosystem. The Linux Foundation report showed that only 14% of open-source contributors surveyed were getting paid for their work. While this volunteer spirit aligns with the original vision of free software as a commerce-free exchange of ideas, free labor presents a major access issue. Additionally, 30% of respondents in the survey did not trust that codes of conduct would be enforced—suggesting they did not feel they could count on a respectful working environment. “We’re at another inflection point now where codes of conduct are great, but they’re only a tool,” says Code for Science and Society’s Danielle Robinson. “I’m starting to see larger cultural shifts toward rethinking extractive processes that have been a part of open source for a long time.” Getting maintainers paid and connecting contributors with support are now key to opening up open source to a more diverse group of participants. With that in mind, this year GitHub established resources specifically for maintainers, including workshops and a hub of DEI tools. And in May, the platform launched a new project to connect large, well-resourced open-source communities with smaller ones that need help. Cheatham says it’s crucial to the success of any of these programs that they be shared for free with the broader community. “We’re not inventing anything new at all. We’re just applying open-source principles to diversity, equity, and inclusion,” she says.  GitHub’s influence over open source may be large, but it is not the only group working to get maintainers paid and expand open-source participation. The Software Freedom Conservancy’s Outreachy diversity initiative offers paid internships; as of 2019, 92% of past Outreachy interns have identified as women and 64% as people of color. Open-source fundraising platforms like Open Collective and Tidelift have also emerged to help maintainers tap into resources.  The philanthropic world is stepping up too. The Ford Foundation, the Sloan Foundation, Omidyar Network, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, as well as smaller organizations like Code for Science and Society, have all recently begun or expanded their efforts to support open-source research, contributors, and projects—including specific efforts promoting inclusion and diversity. Govind Shivkumar from Omidyar Network told MIT Technology Review that philanthropy is well positioned to establish funding architecture that could help prove out open-source projects, making them less risky prospects for future governmental funding. In fact, research supported by the Ford Foundation’s Digital Infrastructure Fund contributed to Germany’s recent creation of a national fund for open digital infrastructure. Momentum has also been building in the US. In 2016 the White House began requiring at least 20% of government-­developed software to be open source. Last year’s Securing Open Source Software Act passed with bipartisan support, establishing a framework for attention and investment at the federal level toward making open-source software stronger and more secure. Open source contributes valuable practices and tools, but it may also offer a competitive advantage over proprietary efforts. A document leaked in May from Google argued that open-source communities had pushed, tested, integrated, and expanded the capabilities of large language models more thoroughly than private efforts could’ve accomplished on their own: “Many of the new ideas [in AI development] are from ordinary people. The barrier to entry for training and experimentation has dropped from the total output of a major research organization to one person, an evening, and a beefy laptop.” The recently articulated concept of Time till Open Source Alternative (TTOSA)—the time between the release of a proprietary product and an open-source equivalent—also speaks to this advantage. One researcher estimated the average TTOSA to be seven years but noted that the process has been speeding up thanks to easy-to-use services like GitHub.  At the same time, much of our modern world now relies on underfunded and rapidly expanding digital infrastructure. There has long been an assumption within open source that bugs can be identified and solved quickly by the “many eyes” of a wide community—and indeed this can be true. But when open-source software affects millions of users and its maintenance is handled by handfuls of underpaid individuals, the weight can be too much for the system to bear. In 2021, a security vulnerability in a popular open-source Apache library exposed an estimated hundreds of millions of devices to hacking attacks. Major players across the industry were affected, and large parts of the internet went down. The vulnerability’s lasting impact is hard to quantify even now. Volunteer-run projects like Log4J keep the internet running. The result is unsustainable burnout, and a national security risk when they go wrong. Other risks emerge from open-source development without the support of ethical guardrails. Proprietary efforts like Google’s Bard and OpenAI’s ChatGPT have demonstrated that AI can perpetuate existing biases and may even cause harm—while also not providing the transparency that could help a larger community audit the technology, improve it, and learn from its mistakes. But allowing anyone to use, modify, and distribute AI models and technology could accelerate their misuse. One week after Meta began granting access to its AI model LLaMA, the package leaked onto 4chan, a platform known for spreading misinformation. LLaMA 2, a new model released in July, is fully open to the public, but the company has not disclosed its training data as is typical in open-source projects—putting it somewhere in between open and closed by some definitions, but decidedly not open by OSI’s. (OpenAI is reportedly working on an open-source model as well but has not made a formal announcement.) “There are always trade-offs in the decisions you make in technology,” says Margaret Mitchell, chief ethics scientist at Hugging Face. “I can’t just be wholeheartedly supportive of open source in all cases without any nuances or caveats.” Mitchell and her team have been working on open-source tools to help communities safeguard their work, such as gating mechanisms to allow collaboration only at the project owner’s discretion, and “model cards” that detail a model’s potential biases and social impacts—information researchers and the public can take into consideration when choosing which models to work with.  Open-source software has come a long way since its rebellious roots. But carrying it forward and making it into a movement that fully reflects the values of openness, reciprocity, and access will require careful consideration, financial and community investment, and the movement’s characteristic process of self-improvement through collaboration. As the modern world becomes more dispersed and diverse, the skill sets required to work asynchronously with different groups of people and technologies toward a common goal are only growing more essential. At this rate, 40 years from now technology might look more open than ever—and the world may be better for it.  Rebecca Ackermann is a writer, designer, and artist based in San Francisco. ","When Xerox donated a new laser printer to the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1980 , the company couldn ’ t have known that the machine would ignite a revolution . The printer jammed . And according to the 2002 book Free as in Freedom , Richard M. Stallman , then a 27-year-old programmer at MIT , tried to dig into the code to fix it . He expected to be able to : he ’ d done it with previous printers . The early decades of software development generally ran on a culture of open access and free exchange , where engineers could dive into each other ’ s code across time zones and institutions to make it their own or squash a few bugs . But this new printer ran on inaccessible proprietary software . Stallman was locked out—and enraged that Xerox had violated the open code-sharing system he ’ d come to rely on . A few years later , in September 1983 , Stallman released GNU , an operating system designed to be a free alternative to one of the dominant operating systems at the time : Unix . Stallman envisioned GNU as a means to fight back against the proprietary mechanisms , like copyright , that were beginning to flood the tech industry . The free-software movement was born from one frustrated engineer ’ s simple , rigid philosophy : for the good of the world , all code should be open , without restriction or commercial intervention . Forty years later , tech companies are making billions on proprietary software , and much of the technology around us—from ChatGPT to smart thermostats—is inscrutable to everyday consumers . In this environment , Stallman ’ s movement may look like a failed values experiment crushed under the weight of commercial reality . But in 2023 , the free and open-source software movement is not only alive and well ; it has become a keystone of the tech industry . Today , 96 % of all code bases incorporate open-source software . GitHub , the biggest platform for the open-source community , is used by more than 100 million developers worldwide . The Biden administration ’ s Securing Open Source Software Act of 2022 publicly recognized open-source software as critical economic and security infrastructure . Even AWS , Amazon ’ s money-making cloud arm , supports the development and maintenance of open-source software ; it committed its portfolio of patents to an open use community in December of last year . Over the last two years , while public trust in private technology companies has plummeted , organizations including Google , Spotify , the Ford Foundation , Bloomberg , and NASA have established new funding for open-source projects and their counterparts in open science efforts—an extension of the same values applied to scientific research . The fact that open-source software is now so essential means that long-standing leadership and diversity issues in the movement have become everyone ’ s problems . Many open-source projects began with “ benevolent dictator for life ” ( BDFL ) models of governance , where original founders hang on to leadership for years—and not always responsibly . Stallman and some other BDFLs have been criticized by their own communities for misogynistic or even abusive behavior . Stallman stepped down as president of the Free Software Foundation in 2019 ( although he returned to the board two years later ) . Overall , open-source participants are still overwhelmingly white , male , and located in the Global North . Projects can be overly influenced by corporate interests . Meanwhile , the people doing the hard work of keeping critical code healthy are not consistently funded . In fact , many major open-source projects still operate almost completely on volunteer steam . Greater access to the code behind generative models is fueling innovation . But if top companies get spooked , they could close up shop . Challenges notwithstanding , there ’ s plenty to celebrate in 2023 , the year of GNU ’ s 40th birthday . The modern open-source movement persists as a collaborative haven for transparent ways of working within a highly fragmented and competitive industry . Selena Deckelmann , chief product and technology officer at the Wikimedia Foundation , says the power of open source lies in its “ idea that people anywhere can collaborate together on software , but also on many [ more ] things. ” She points out that tools to put this philosophy into action , like mailing lists , online chat , and open version control systems , were pioneered in open-source communities and have been adopted as standard practice by the wider tech industry . “ We found a way for people from all over the world , regardless of background , to find a common cause to collaborate with each other , ” says Kelsey Hightower , an early contributor to Kubernetes , an open-source system for automating app deployment and management , who recently retired from his role as a distinguished engineer at Google Cloud . “ I think that is pretty unique to the world of open source. ” The 2010s backlash against tech ’ s unfettered growth , and the recent AI boom , have focused a spotlight on the open-source movement ’ s ideas about who has the right to use other people ’ s information online and who benefits from technology . Clement Delangue , CEO of the open-source AI company Hugging Face , which was recently valued at $ 4 billion , testified before Congress in June of 2023 that “ ethical openness ” in AI development could help make organizations more compliant and transparent , while allowing researchers beyond a few large tech companies access to technology and progress . “ We ’ re in a unique cultural moment , ” says Danielle Robinson , executive director of Code for Science and Society , a nonprofit that provides funding and support for public-interest technology . “ People are more aware than ever of how capitalism has been influencing what technologies get built , and whether you have a choice to interact with it. ” Once again , free and open-source software have become a natural home for the debate about how technology should be . The early days of the free-software movement were fraught with arguments about the meaning of “ free. ” Stallman and the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , founded in 1985 , held firm to the idea of four freedoms : people should be allowed to run a program for any purpose , study how it works from the source code and change it to meet their needs , redistribute copies , and distribute modified versions too . Stallman saw free software as an essential right : “ Free as in free speech , not free beer , ” as his apocryphal slogan goes . He created the GNU General Public License , what ’ s known as a “ copyleft ” license , to ensure that the four freedoms were protected in code built with GNU . Linus Torvalds , the Finnish engineer who in 1991 created the now ubiquitous Unix alternative Linux , didn ’ t buy into this dogma . Torvalds and others , including Microsoft ’ s Bill Gates , believed that the culture of open exchange among engineers could coexist with commerce , and that more-restrictive licenses could forge a path toward both financial sustainability and protections for software creators and users . It was during a 1998 strategic meeting of free-software advocates—which notably did not include Stallman—that this pragmatic approach became known as “ open source. ” ( The term was coined and introduced to the group not by an engineer , but by the futurist and nano­technology scholar Christine Peterson . ) Karen Sandler , executive director of the Software Freedom Conservancy , a nonprofit that advocates for free and open-source software , saw firsthand how the culture shifted from orthodoxy to a big-tent approach with room for for-profit entities when she worked as general counsel at the Software Freedom Law Center in the early 2000s . “ The people who were ideological—some of them stayed quite ideological . But many of them realized , oh , wait a minute , we can get jobs doing this . We can do well by doing good , ” Sandler remembers . By leveraging the jobs and support that early tech companies were offering , open-source contributors could sustain their efforts and even make a living doing what they believed in . In that manner , companies using and contributing to free and open software could expand the community beyond volunteer enthusiasts and improve the work itself . “ How could we ever make it better if it ’ s just a few radical people ? ” Sandler says . As the tech industry grew around private companies like Sun Microsystems , IBM , Microsoft , and Apple in the late ’ 90s and early ’ 00s , new open-source projects sprang up , and established ones grew roots . Apache emerged as an open-source web server in 1995 . Red Hat , a company offering enterprise companies support for open-source software like Linux , went public in 1999 . GitHub , a platform originally created to support version control for open-source projects , launched in 2008 , the same year that Google released Android , the first open-source phone operating system . The more pragmatic definition of the concept came to dominate the field . Meanwhile , Stallman ’ s original philosophy persisted among dedicated groups of believers—where it still lives today through nonprofits like FSF , which only uses and advocates for software that protects the four freedoms . “ If a company only ends up just sharing , and nothing more , I think that should be celebrated. ” As open-source software spread , a bifurcation of the tech stack became standard practice , with open-source code as the support structure for proprietary work . Free and open-source software often served in the underlying foundation or back-end architecture of a product , while companies vigorously pursued and defended copyrights on the user-facing layers . Some estimate that Amazon ’ s 1999 patent on its one-click buying process was worth $ 2.4 billion per year to the company until it expired . It relied on Java , an open-source programming language , and other open-source software and tooling to build and maintain it . Today , corporations not only depend on open-source software but play an enormous role in funding and developing open-source projects : Kubernetes ( initially launched and maintained at Google ) and Meta ’ s React are both robust sets of software that began as internal solutions freely shared with the larger technology community . But some people , like the Software Freedom Conservancy ’ s Karen Sandler , identify an ongoing conflict between profit-­driven corporations and the public interest . “ Companies have become so savvy and educated with respect to open-source software that they use a ton of it . That ’ s good , ” says Sandler . At the same time , they profit from their proprietary work—which they sometimes attempt to pass off as open too , a practice the scholar and organizer Michelle Thorne dubbed “ openwashing ” in 2009 . For Sandler , if companies don ’ t also make efforts to support user and creator rights , they ’ re not pushing forward the free and open-source ethos . And she says for the most part , that ’ s indeed not happening : “ They ’ re not interested in giving the public any appreciable rights to their software. ” Others , including Kelsey Hightower , are more sanguine about corporate involvement . “ If a company only ends up just sharing , and nothing more , I think that should be celebrated , ” he says . “ Then if for the next two years you allow your paid employees to work on it , maintaining the bugs and issues , but then down the road it ’ s no longer a priority and you choose to step back , I think we should thank [ the company ] for those years of contributions. ” In stark contrast , FSF , now in its 38th year , holds firm to its original ideals and opposes any product or company that does not support the ability for users to view , modify , and redistribute code . The group today runs public action campaigns like “ End Software Patents , ” publishing articles and submitting amicus briefs advocating the end of patents on software . The foundation ’ s executive director , Zoë Kooyman , hopes to continue pushing the conversation toward freedom rather than commercial concerns . “ Every belief system or form of advocacy needs a far end , ” she says . “ That ’ s the only way to be able to drive the needle . [ At FSF ] , we are that far end of the spectrum , and we take that role very seriously. ” Forty years on from the release of GNU , there is no singular open-source community , “ any more than there is an ‘ urban community , ’ ” as researcher and engineer Nadia Asparouhova ( formerly Eghbal ) writes in her 2020 book Working in Public : The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software . There ’ s no singular definition , either . The Open Source Initiative ( OSI ) was founded in 1998 to steward the meaning of the phrase , but not all modern open-source projects adhere to the 10 specific criteria OSI laid out , and other definitions appear across communities . Scale , technology , social norms , and funding also range widely from project to project and community to community . For example , Kubernetes has a robust , organized community of tens of thousands of contributors and years of Google investment . Salmon is a niche open-source bioinformatics research tool with fewer than 50 contributors , supported by grants . OpenSSL , which encrypts an estimated 66 % of the web , is currently maintained by 18 engineers compensated through donations and elective corporate contracts . The major discussions now are more about people than technology : What does healthy and diverse collaboration look like ? How can those who support the code get what they need to continue the work ? “ How do you include a voice for all the people affected by the technology you build ? ” asks James Vasile , an open-source consultant and strategist who sits on the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation . “ These are big questions . We ’ ve never grappled with them before . No one was working on this 20 years ago , because that just wasn ’ t part of the scene . Now it is , and we [ in the open-source community ] have the chance to consider these questions. ” “ We need designers , ethnographers , social and cultural experts . We need everyone to be playing a role in open source. ” “ Free as in puppy , ” a phrase that can be traced back to 2006 , has emerged as a valuable definition of “ free ” for modern open-source projects—one that speaks to the responsibilities of creators and users to each other and the software , in addition to their rights . Puppies need food and care to survive ; open-source code needs funding and “ maintainers , ” individuals who consistently respond to requests and feedback from a community , fix bugs , and manage the growth and scope of a project . Many open-source projects have become too big , complicated , or important to be governed by one person or even a small group of like-minded individuals . And open-source contributors have their own needs and concerns , too . A person who ’ s good at building may not be good at maintaining ; someone who creates a project may not want to or be able to run it indefinitely . In 2018 , for instance , Guido van Rossum , the creator of the open-source programming language Python , stepped down from leadership after almost 30 years , exhausted from the demands of the mostly uncompensated role . “ I ’ m tired , ” he wrote in his resignation message to the community , “ and need a very long break. ” Supporting the people who create , maintain , and use free and open-source software requires new roles and perspectives . Whereas the movement in its early days was populated almost exclusively by engineers communicating across message boards and through code , today ’ s open-source projects invite participation from new disciplines to handle logistical work like growth and advocacy , as well as efforts toward greater inclusion and belonging . “ We ’ ve shifted from open source being about just the technical stuff to the broader set of expertise and perspectives that are required to make effective open-source projects , ” says Michael Brennan , senior program officer with the Technology and Society program at the Ford Foundation , which funds research into open internet issues . “ We need designers , ethnographers , social and cultural experts . We need everyone to be playing a role in open source if it ’ s going to be effective and meet the needs of the people around the world. ” One powerful source of support arrived in 2008 with the launch of GitHub . While it began as a version control tool , it has grown into a suite of services , standards , and systems that is now the “ highway system ” for most open-source development , as Asparouhova puts it in Working in Public . GitHub helped lower the barrier to entry , drawing wider contribution and spreading best practices such as community codes of conduct . But its success has also given a single platform vast influence over communities dedicated to decentralized collaboration . Demetris Cheatham , until recently GitHub ’ s senior director for diversity and inclusion strategy , took that responsibility very seriously . To find out where things stood , the company partnered with the Linux Foundation in 2021 on a survey and resulting report on diversity and inclusion within open source . The data showed that despite a pervasive ethos of collaboration and openness ( more than 80 % of the respondents reported feeling welcome ) , communities are dominated by contributors who are straight , white , male , and from the Global North . In response , Cheatham , who is now the company ’ s chief of staff , focused on ways to broaden access and promote a sense of belonging . GitHub launched All In for Students , a mentorship and education program with 30 students drawn primarily from historically Black colleges and universities . In its second year , the program expanded to more than 400 students . Representation has not been the only stumbling block to a more equitable open-source ecosystem . The Linux Foundation report showed that only 14 % of open-source contributors surveyed were getting paid for their work . While this volunteer spirit aligns with the original vision of free software as a commerce-free exchange of ideas , free labor presents a major access issue . Additionally , 30 % of respondents in the survey did not trust that codes of conduct would be enforced—suggesting they did not feel they could count on a respectful working environment . “ We ’ re at another inflection point now where codes of conduct are great , but they ’ re only a tool , ” says Code for Science and Society ’ s Danielle Robinson . “ I ’ m starting to see larger cultural shifts toward rethinking extractive processes that have been a part of open source for a long time. ” Getting maintainers paid and connecting contributors with support are now key to opening up open source to a more diverse group of participants . With that in mind , this year GitHub established resources specifically for maintainers , including workshops and a hub of DEI tools . And in May , the platform launched a new project to connect large , well-resourced open-source communities with smaller ones that need help . Cheatham says it ’ s crucial to the success of any of these programs that they be shared for free with the broader community . “ We ’ re not inventing anything new at all . We ’ re just applying open-source principles to diversity , equity , and inclusion , ” she says . GitHub ’ s influence over open source may be large , but it is not the only group working to get maintainers paid and expand open-source participation . The Software Freedom Conservancy ’ s Outreachy diversity initiative offers paid internships ; as of 2019 , 92 % of past Outreachy interns have identified as women and 64 % as people of color . Open-source fundraising platforms like Open Collective and Tidelift have also emerged to help maintainers tap into resources . The philanthropic world is stepping up too . The Ford Foundation , the Sloan Foundation , Omidyar Network , and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative , as well as smaller organizations like Code for Science and Society , have all recently begun or expanded their efforts to support open-source research , contributors , and projects—including specific efforts promoting inclusion and diversity . Govind Shivkumar from Omidyar Network told MIT Technology Review that philanthropy is well positioned to establish funding architecture that could help prove out open-source projects , making them less risky prospects for future governmental funding . In fact , research supported by the Ford Foundation ’ s Digital Infrastructure Fund contributed to Germany ’ s recent creation of a national fund for open digital infrastructure . Momentum has also been building in the US . In 2016 the White House began requiring at least 20 % of government-­developed software to be open source . Last year ’ s Securing Open Source Software Act passed with bipartisan support , establishing a framework for attention and investment at the federal level toward making open-source software stronger and more secure . Open source contributes valuable practices and tools , but it may also offer a competitive advantage over proprietary efforts . A document leaked in May from Google argued that open-source communities had pushed , tested , integrated , and expanded the capabilities of large language models more thoroughly than private efforts could ’ ve accomplished on their own : “ Many of the new ideas [ in AI development ] are from ordinary people . The barrier to entry for training and experimentation has dropped from the total output of a major research organization to one person , an evening , and a beefy laptop. ” The recently articulated concept of Time till Open Source Alternative ( TTOSA ) —the time between the release of a proprietary product and an open-source equivalent—also speaks to this advantage . One researcher estimated the average TTOSA to be seven years but noted that the process has been speeding up thanks to easy-to-use services like GitHub . At the same time , much of our modern world now relies on underfunded and rapidly expanding digital infrastructure . There has long been an assumption within open source that bugs can be identified and solved quickly by the “ many eyes ” of a wide community—and indeed this can be true . But when open-source software affects millions of users and its maintenance is handled by handfuls of underpaid individuals , the weight can be too much for the system to bear . In 2021 , a security vulnerability in a popular open-source Apache library exposed an estimated hundreds of millions of devices to hacking attacks . Major players across the industry were affected , and large parts of the internet went down . The vulnerability ’ s lasting impact is hard to quantify even now . Volunteer-run projects like Log4J keep the internet running . The result is unsustainable burnout , and a national security risk when they go wrong . Other risks emerge from open-source development without the support of ethical guardrails . Proprietary efforts like Google ’ s Bard and OpenAI ’ s ChatGPT have demonstrated that AI can perpetuate existing biases and may even cause harm—while also not providing the transparency that could help a larger community audit the technology , improve it , and learn from its mistakes .

The US-China chip war is still escalating,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/07/12/1076156/us-china-tech-war-escalating/,2023-07-12,"<p>China starts to push back against ever-tightening export restrictions around semiconductors.</p>
","This story first appeared in China Report, MIT Technology Review’s newsletter about technology developments in China. Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Tuesday. The temperature of the US-China tech conflict just keeps rising. Last week, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced a new export license system for gallium and germanium, two elements that are used to make computer chips, fiber optics, solar cells, and other tech devices. Most experts see the move as China’s most significant retaliation against the West’s semiconductor tech blockade, which expanded dramatically last October when the US limited the export to China of the most cutting-edge chips and the equipment capable of making them.  Earlier this year, China responded by putting Raytheon and Lockheed Martin on a list of unreliable entities and banned domestic companies from buying chips from the American company Micron. Yet none of these moves could rival the global impact of the gallium/germanium export control. By putting a chokehold on these two raw materials, China is signaling that it, in turn, can cause pain for the Western tech system and push other countries to rethink the curbs they put on China. The country aims to restrict the supply of gallium and germanium, two materials used in computer chips and other products. But experts say it won’t have the desired impact. But as I reported yesterday, China’s new export controls may not have much long-term impact. “Export control is not as effective if the technologies are available in other markets,” Sarah Bauerle Danzman, an associate professor of international studies at Indiana University Bloomington, told me. Since the technology to produce gallium and germanium is very mature, it won’t be too hard for mines in other countries to ramp up their production, although it will take time, investment, policy incentives, and maybe technological improvement to make the process more environmentally friendly. So what happens now? Half of 2023 is now behind us, and even though there have been a few diplomatic events showing the US-China relationship warming up, like trips to China made by US officials Antony Blinken and Janet Yellen, the tensions on the technological front are only getting worse. When the US instituted its chip-related export restrictions in October, it wasn’t clear how much of an impact they would have, because the US doesn’t control the entirety of the semiconductor supply chain. Analysts said one of the biggest outstanding questions was the extent to which the US could persuade its allies to join the blockade.  Now the US has managed to get the key players on board. In May, Japan announced that it is limiting the export of 23 types of equipment used in a variety of chipmaking processes. It even went further than the original US rules. The US limited the export of tools for making the most cutting-edge chips—those of the 14-nanometer generation and under. Japan’s restrictions extend to older, less-advanced chip generations (all the way to the 45-nanometer level), which has the Chinese semiconductor industry worried that production of basic chips used in everyday products, like cars, will also be affected. At the end of June, the Netherlands followed suit and announced that it will limit the export to China of deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography machines used to pattern chips. That’s also an escalation of the previous rules, which since 2019 had only limited export of the most advanced extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. These expanding restrictions likely prompted China to take a page from its enemies’ playbook by instituting the controls on gallium and germanium.  Yellen’s visit last week shows that this back-and-forth retaliation between China and the US-led bloc is not ending anytime soon. Both Yellen and the Chinese leaders expressed their concern at the meeting about the other side’s export controls, yet neither said anything about backing down.  If more aggressive actions are taken soon, we may see the tech war expand out of the semiconductor field to involve things like battery technologies. As I explained in my piece on Monday, that’s where China would have a larger advantage.  Do you believe the technological tensions between the US and China will worsen from here?

The tragic incident again highlighted the importance of depression treatment, which is often inaccessible in China. As the Chinese publication Xin Kuai Bao reported, fewer than 10% of patients diagnosed with depression in China have received any kind of medical treatment.  But in recent years, as several patents for popular Western brand-name depression drugs have expired, Chinese pharmaceutical companies have ramped up their production of local generic alternatives. There’s also a fierce race to invent home-grown treatments. Last November, the first domestically designed depression drug was approved for sale in China, marking a new era for the industry. There are 17 more domestic treatments in trials right now. Every time high-profile US visitors come to China, Chinese social media always fixates on one thing: what they ate. Apparently, Janet Yellen is a fan of the wild mushrooms from China’s southwest border, which her group ordered four times in one dinner. The specific mushroom, called Jian Shou Qing in China, is also known for having psychedelic effects if not cooked properly. Now the restaurant is cashing in by offering Yellen’s dinner choices as a set, branded the “God of Money” menu, according to Quartz.

Software engineers and their ability to deliver are critical to a business’ success. They help organizations keep pace with innovation and respond to disruptive forces. Even companies in industries that are not traditionally considered tech, such as agriculture or financial services, recognize the need for software engineers and are actively seeking to hire talented individuals. Software engineers are responsible for an ever-growing list of demands through the software development cycle. Their working environment is more complex due to proliferation of complex multicloud infrastructure, tooling, and applications. While they command good salaries and professional esteem, the job takes its toll. Additionally, ever-evolving cyber threats and the constant need to stay ahead in terms of continual scanning and early detection add to the complexity.  A 2021 poll conducted by Haystack Analytics found 83% of developers were suffering burnout, driven by increasing demands on their time and inefficient processes. A 2022 survey by LaunchDarkly showed continued burn-out and retention challenges for software engineers, with cumbersome processes a key frustration. Challenges are more acute in organizations saddled with technical debt, heritage applications, and legacy infrastructure. “The engineer’s job has become extremely hard, but with one of the largest tech footprints and investments, JPMorgan Chase has a unique opportunity and responsibility to lead the industry in a paradigm shift toward minimizing the cognitive load for engineers and multiplying their productivity to accelerate the value we deliver to our customers and clients,” says Sandhya Sridharan, global head of Engineering Platforms and Experience at JPMorgan Chase. As part of its modernization journey, JPMorgan Chase is building in a highly integrated self-service engineer platform designed to empower and enable the company’s 43,000+ person engineering community, with the goal of amplifying experience, engagement, and productivity. The firm’s approach is driven by four strategic imperatives. First is a unified interface. This is a personalized, data-driven experience that gives engineers ownership and has a self-service dynamic, which is a change from business-as-usual. “An engineer platform must simplify an engineer’s day-to-day tasks by providing the right level of contextual abstraction along with the appropriate tooling and resources,” explains Sridharan. “This needs to happen within the context of an integrated development environment where engineers spend most of their time providing complete visualization of their build and deployment pipelines.” The second imperative is to be cloud focused. The public cloud offers scalability, which improves speed, agility, and cost. The majority of software developer tooling is primarily available in, and built for, public cloud platforms, which can be more reliable and resilient than on-premise infrastructures. Engineers can quickly take advantage of best-of-breed capabilities, including observability tools, while adopting strategies like canary deployment (releasing first to a small subset of users) that help accelerate time to market. “If we were on-premises, we would not have the flexibility for elastic scale and it wouldn’t be cost effective,” notes Sridharan. The third imperative is to be data-driven, which is core to an industry as complex and fast-moving as financial services. The platform equips engineers with the right data, insights, and recommendations to enable real-time detection and resolution, and to track progress. It also provides telemetry, which can help personalize the engineer experience to individual needs. “Data will power everything we do and inform our decision making as we continue to evolve and improve the platform to best support the needs of our engineers,” Sridharan elaborates. This platform also offers a more robust system for governance and security. Software failures are inevitable, but what matters is whether a platform provides the capability to quickly detect failures and recover. JPMorgan Chase’s platform includes observability tooling that can detect problems and auto-remediate or rollback the change that caused it, reducing outage time for end users. Observability and automation are especially important in heavily regulated sectors, like finance, in terms of audit evidence. “We need to have full traceability of every transaction and changes that go into production,” notes Sridharan. “This not only equips our engineers with detailed insights and trends, but it also saves them several days and weeks of effort anytime we are audited, as the platform provides a full audit report with the click of a button.” JPMorgan Chase’s upgrade of its engineering platform improves productivity, efficiency, and security. Just as important is helping the company compete for engineering talent by offering a vastly more efficient working environment than software engineers might find elsewhere. The firm’s goal is to be the most attractive engineering destination, and given the consistent competition for good talent, it’s more important than ever to offer engineers a world-class working environment with minimal friction. “Engineering excellence and a highly intuitive platform are critical for us to not only retain our top talent, but also continue to attract the best talent in the industry,” says Sridharan. By abstracting both the controls and the infrastructure complexities, JPMorgan Chase’s platform allows engineers to focus on high-value productivity, rather than being mired in coordination or laborious processes. It abstracts controls by automatically factoring in the relevant workflows and processes, such as differing regulatory environments, which the platform incorporates through its policy and rules engine. This allows engineers to focus on what they do best: build high value applications which are scalable, robust, and resilient. As many companies move to multicloud or hybrid cloud environments, some workloads are best conducted via one cloud hyperscaler platform or another. However, choosing which one shouldn’t tax an engineer’s time. The platform directs workflows into the right infrastructure based on factors like regulation and capacity. Abstracting all of this complexity, while providing context where needed, means developers can focus on building the right application to generate customer value.  “To make JPMorgan Chase the most attractive engineering destination, we need to be able to not only remove friction every step of the way, but we need to build a solid foundation that evolves and simplifies the day-to-day life of a software engineer, which will help accelerate our business outcomes,” concludes Sridharan.

A new generation of financial technology (fintech) companies—peer-to-peer payment services, mobile banking apps, and trading platforms—offer consumers powerful tools to manage their money and extend their banking capabilities. According to the online data platform Statista, the worldwide number of consumers using open banking services is projected to reach 132.2 million by 2024. With open finance, the next iteration of open banking, consumers can control and share their financial information securely with TPPs or financial institutions, accessing an array of financial services including digital banking, lending, payments, renting property, and investing. For consumers the services promise fairness, new products, safety, transparency, convenience, and choice—the ability to control and manage their own data for their own benefit. To deliver, open finance requires strong guardrails for cybersecurity, regulations, and education to ensure consumers can make sound financial decisions. For many, access to financial services like credit is essential for autonomy and economic freedom. However, the credit system’s rigid categories and controls leave out some consumers. According to a TransUnion 2022 global study, 8.1 million people in the U.S. (3% of adults) are considered credit unserved, and another 37 million are considered credit underserved (14% of adults); in Canada, 9.6 million people are either credit unserved or underserved, more than 30% of adults. Systems that evaluate consumer data can be fraught with biases. In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found individual credit information is significantly different across its three large credit reference agencies (CRAs). It reports relatively low understanding about credit among consumers, and found it is difficult to access credit information, or to raise disputes. Similarly, a 2015 U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) study looked at “credit invisibles” —individuals with no credit or a limited credit history who are less likely to be approved for loans based on the data provided by the three nationwide credit reporting agencies (NCRAs). The CFPB concludes this bias disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic financial consumers. Immigrants encounter bias in credit score calculations as well. Raja Chakravorti, universal access lead at financial services company Plaid, says Fair Isaac Corp-oration (FICO) score calculations do not consistently pull data properly across borders, something he hopes open finance can help fix. “One of the hopes and advantages of open banking or open finance is that we are creating more of that positive trajectory, and over time, financial services would become more inclusive,” he says. Chakravorti says traditional credit bureau data is not the only way to find out whether a consumer is a good financial risk. Alternate data—such as investments, loans, utility payments, and subscription payments—can show a person’s financial behavior and also indicate financial health, he says. How a consumer manages personal finances, like paying bills on time and consistently, can show how likely they are to meet financial responsibilities, he says. Download the full report.

Credit card fraud accounted for more than $32 billion in losses—or about 6.6 cents per $100 in transactions—in 2021, with more than one-third occurring the U.S., according to a December 2022 Nilson Report study. Fraud risks of this scale require real-time authentication of individual transactions, which opens the door for errors—potentially allowing a fraudulent transaction or denying a legitimate purchase. However, real-time verification also allows cardholders—and Mastercard—to benefit from the global marketplace. To tackle this challenge, Mastercard marries fraud-detection technologies with AI, using the data it collects over its network. Hitting the right balance between denying potentially legitimate transactions and allowing questionable transactions is a challenge, says Rohit Chauhan, executive vice president of AI at Mastercard. “It’s a really tricky kind of model where you want to decline every possible fraudulent transaction, but at the same time, let the legitimate transactions pass through without any friction,” he says. “On an average day, we see over a billion transactions, and since data is what fuels AI, we were definitely one of the early adopters.” Yet, the benefits of AI adoption surpass improved fraud detection. As such, the application of AI throughout Mastercard has become a priority, Chauhan said.  “The use of AI is about future-proofing Mastercard,” Chauhan says. “If it’s the new electricity, we want electricity to be flowing through every division within Mastercard, and every business unit should be benefiting from it, rather than just the places where it naturally incubates.” Mastercard is not alone. Financial services and banking see AI as an opportunity to automate massively at scale, keep up with accelerating customer expectations, stay competitive in an evolving marketplace, and prepare for disruptions. As AI use cases grow beyond fraud detection and searching unstructured data (data that isn’t organized or in the correct format for an application), businesses will increasingly put AI-powered functionality into the hands of non-technical workers and business operations, allowing innovation to happen across the organization.  With training, retooling, and increased exposure to data, business users can play a central role in building analytics workflows, more efficiently handle regulatory requests, and ensure the quality of data.  Whether the systems are called AI, machine-learning (ML) models, or automated data analytics, data is taking on a more significant role inside companies, says John McCambridge, global solutions director for financial services and insurance at AI and machine learning firm Dataiku. “People are using advanced analytics to solve various problems inside of their businesses and generate lots of return on investment,” he says. “It’s absolutely a potential source of value and can solve very specific problems.” Download the full report.
