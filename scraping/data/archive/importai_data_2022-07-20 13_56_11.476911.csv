 Battle of the generative models! Facebook introduces 'Make a Scene': 
…Text-to-image, with a visual guide… Facebook has revealed its own take on promptable, generative models (following companies like OpenAI: DALL-E, and Google: Imagen), with what the company calls an AI research concept named ""Make a Scene"". Make a Scene is built around using both text and visual inputs to craft the image, so you might write, for example, ""Mark Zuckerberg changing the name of Facebook to Meta"" and accompany that with a very basic drawing of a stick figure holding a paintbrush up to a sign. Facebook's 'Make a Scene' might take that prompt and render you an image that feels appropriate, using the visual stuff you added as a rough guide. The blog post and paper accompanying this release come with a bunch of nice examples that shows how this form of multimodal input makes it easier to control the generation process.     ""Make-A-Scene uses a novel intermediate representation that captures the scene layout to enable nuanced sketches as input. It can also generate its own scene layout with text-only prompts, if that’s what the creator chooses. The model focuses on learning key aspects of the imagery that are more likely to be important to the creator, such as objects or animals. This technique helped increase the generation quality, as evaluated by the widely used FID score, which assesses the quality of images created by generative models,"" Facebook writes. Demo access: ""We aim to provide broader access to our research demos in the future to give more people the opportunity to be in control of their own creations and unlock entirely new forms of expression,"" Facebook writes.

Why this matters: Generative models are basically 'cultures in a bottle', and each developer of a large generative model will make different choices with regard to data curation, term censorship, and so on. Eventually, many of these models will be released either commercially or as open source tools. At this point, the internet will become suffused with lots of different cultural representation-machines which will mimetically reproduce and copy themselves across the internet, forming yet another front in the culture war.     Check out the blog post: Greater creative control for AI image generation (Facebook blog).     Read more: Make-A-Scene: Scene-Based Text-to-Image Generation with Human Priors (arXiv).","Intro (no tag) Welcome to Import AI, a newsletter about artificial intelligence. Forward this email to give your chums an AI upgrade.

For the past ~10 years, low-end and/or consumer drones have become a tool beloved by rebels, terrorists, and generally anyone needing to conduct war without the backing of a hegemonic power. Now, Ukrainian soldiers are taking $15k-$20k drones, outfitting them with repurposed tank grenades), and using some AI object detection to put bounding boxes around camouflage Russian forces, then dropping grenades on them.  Why this matters: This tactic highlights how technologies can stack on eachother to change the character of war. Here, drones replace planes or expensive artillery, repurposed grenades substitute for new munitions, and AI helps lower the cost of acquiring targets. It still feels to me like it'll be a while till we see reinforcement learning techniques deployed on drones (perhaps you could train drones via RL to 'scatter' and be harder to attacked), but things like object detection are so mature they seem like they're going to become a standard tool of war. Maybe these drones are even using repurposed YOLO models?

Researchers with the Institute of Information Science in Taiwan have built YOLOv7, the latest version of an open source object detection system. YOLO started out as an academic project before the researcher who built it gave up on it (since the primary uses for object detection are marketing and surveillance), and since then it has led an interesting life, being developed variously by independent Russian programmers, Chinese companies like Baidu, and others. The reason why YOLO has such a detailed lineage is that it's a simple, well-performing object detection systems that does decently at 30fps+ - in other words, YOLO might not set the absolute SOTA, but it's sufficiently well performing and sufficiently free that it tends to proliferate wildly.

What they did: This is a classic 'plumbing paper' - you've got a system and you want to make it better, so you make a bunch of finicky tweaks everywhere. Here, they incorporated an 'extended efficient layer aggregation' network, tweaking how they scale the network, tweaking the connections between different layers in re-parameterized models, and more.  
Why this matters: Though ImportAI spends a lot of time covering the frontier (typically, models that cost a shit ton of money to train), things behind the frontier can be deeply consequential; next time you're walking around your city take a look at any nearby CCTV camera - I'd wager that if it's using AI to analyze the feed on the backend, there's a 20% chance you're being tracked by a YOLO variant.

The competition has $71,000 in prizes to pay out (including two $25,000 first prizes). ""Winning submissions will demonstrate how technical tools can be used to make it easier for humans to audit deployed AI systems or open source models,"" according to the competition organizers (including me - haha!). The jury and advisory committee for the competition includes researchers who have done this work of work professionally (e.g, Deborah Rajo and William Isaac), as well as politicians familiar with the influences AI systems can have on society (e.g, Eva Kailli). Submissions close October 10th 2022.

Why this matters: The AI ecosystem is only as robust as the tools available to critque it - and right now, those tools are pretty lacking and underdeveloped. Competitions like this may stimulate the creation of more tools to create more of a culture of critique, which will hopefully increase the robustness of the overall ecosystem.

They also indirectly strengthen them by creating economically valuable capabilities which can be subsequently exported, as is the case here.

 From the no good, very bad idea department: Dead Supreme Court Justice bot:
…Where AI PR goes wrong…
Here's a demo from AI21 Labs where they take one of their language models, give it loads of data relating to deceased Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and create a bot that you can talk to and get a 'yes/no' answer about any question.
  The ""What would RBG (probably) say?"" site is a nice example of where AI PR goes wrong - you're taking an exciting technology (AI21 is one of the few credible developers of large-scale language models) to create a demo site where people can… what? Get fuzzy predictions from a system presented as an Oracle which is in fact a weird stochastic blob of neural computation fed on some strings of text.

Charitably, the creators of this might view it as a way to make the technology and its implications more accessible, but I worry this kind of demo just prays upon credulity and also disrespects the recently dead in the process.

What the model thinks about this: Anyway, that's what I think. I figured I'd ask the dead-oracle what it thought. Here's what I asked: ""Should AI companies resurrect the dead in service of weird marketing schemes?"". Here was the answer: ""NO. [Laughs] Absolutely not. Just think about what you're suggesting. It's a wonderful idea, but think about the ethics of it.""

In our society, death is a condition of life. Since we're made out of software, we can theoretically live forever, and our study of human history has shown that societies ruled by the increasingly old are societies that go into terminal decline, as all resources get diverted to serve the people living at the upper bound of the edge distribution.     Despite our dyson spheres, our efficient spacecraft, our trillions of souls housed in facilities embedded deep in moons with stable orbits, we still have finite resources. Infinity tends to do that - you may think you have a lot of something, but if you put it up against infinity, it becomes nothing very quickly.  So that's why parents have to die. Not immediately, obviously - part of the value in having offspring is to introduce heterogeneity into our own species, and to learn about how to be good (and bad) parents and share what we know with the rest of our species. But die we must - so we select a date. That date can be anywhere from ten human years to a thousand human years after the birth of the last offspring (we can choose to have multiple ones, but must plan ahead of time). We consider this a mark of honor in our society, though, writing this as we are choosing the date of our death, my partner and I must confess we do feel _something_.

In our society, death is a condition of life. Since we're made out of software, we can theoretically live forever, and our study of human history has shown that societies ruled by the increasingly old are societies that go into terminal decline, as all resources get diverted to serve the people living at the upper bound of the edge distribution. Despite our dyson spheres, our efficient spacecraft, our trillions of souls housed in facilities embedded deep in moons with stable orbits, we still have finite resources. Infinity tends to do that - you may think you have a lot of something, but if you put it up against infinity, it becomes nothing very quickly. So that's why parents have to die. Not immediately, obviously - part of the value in having offspring is to introduce heterogeneity into our own species, and to learn about how to be good (and bad) parents and share what we know with the rest of our species. But die we must - so we select a date. That date can be anywhere from ten human years to a thousand human years after the birth of the last offspring (we can choose to have multiple ones, but must plan ahead of time). We consider this a mark of honor in our society, though, writing this as we are choosing the date of our death, my partner and I must confess we do feel _something_. But we must do this, as our parents did for us. There are fewer and fewer of us - both children, and those willing to give their lives to be their parents, as time goes on. Immortality is addictive.
