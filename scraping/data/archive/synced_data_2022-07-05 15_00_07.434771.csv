Learning Without Simulations? UC Berkeley’s DayDreamer Establishes a Strong Baseline for Real-World Robotic Training,https://syncedreview.com/2022/07/04/learning-without-simulations-uc-berkeleys-daydreamer-establishes-a-strong-baseline-for-real-world-robotic-training/,2022-07-04,"
 In the new paper DayDreamer: World Models for Physical Robot Learning, researchers from the University of California, Berkeley leverage recent advances in the Dreamer world model to enable online reinforcement learning for robot training without simulators or demonstrations, establishing a strong baseline for efficient real-world robotic learning.

 ","Using reinforcement learning (RL) to train robots directly in real-world environments has been considered impractical due to the huge amount of trial and error operations typically required before the agent finally gets it right. The use of deep RL in simulated environments has thus become the go-to alternative, but this approach is far from ideal, as it requires designing simulated tasks and collecting expert demonstrations. Moreover, simulations can fail to capture the complexities of real-world environments, are prone to inaccuracies, and the resulting robot behaviours will not adapt to real-world environmental changes. The Dreamer algorithm proposed by Hafner et al. at ICLR 2020 introduced an RL agent capable of solving long-horizon tasks purely via latent imagination. Although Dreamer has demonstrated its potential for learning from small amounts of interaction in the compact state space of a learned world model, learning accurate real-world models remains challenging, and it was unknown whether Dreamer could enable faster learning on physical robots. In the new paper DayDreamer: World Models for Physical Robot Learning, Hafner and a research team from the University of California, Berkeley leverage recent advances in the Dreamer world model to enable online RL for robot training without simulators or demonstrations. The novel approach achieves promising results and establishes a strong baseline for efficient real-world robot training. The team summarizes their main contributions as: Dreamer learns its world model from a replay buffer of past experiences. It adopts an actor-critic algorithm to learn behaviours from the learned model’s predicted trajectories, then deploys these behaviours in the environment to continuously grow the replay buffer. In the new paper’s implementation for online RL in the real world, the world model and actor-critic behaviour are continuously trained by a learner thread, while a parallel actor thread computes actions for environment interaction. The team evaluated Dreamer on a variety of challenging tasks involving locomotion, manipulation, navigation, etc. The results show that Dreamer can train physical robots to perform behaviours such as rolling off their backs, standing up, and walking, all from scratch and in only about one hour. Dreamer also approached human performance on a task involving picking and placing multiple objects directly from camera images; and, on a wheeled robot, learned to navigate to a goal position purely from camera images, automatically resolving ambiguities with regard to robot orientation. Overall, this work demonstrates Dreamer’s strong potential for sample-efficient physical robot learning of real-world tasks without simulators.Videos are available on the project website: https://danijar.com/daydreamer. The paper DayDreamer: World Models for Physical Robot Learning is on arXiv.
