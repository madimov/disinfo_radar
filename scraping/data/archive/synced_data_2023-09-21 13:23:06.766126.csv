From Stagnant to Stunning: Google Transforms Still Images into Photo-Realistic Animations,https://syncedreview.com/2023/09/20/from-stagnant-to-stunning-google-transforms-still-images-into-photo-realistic-animations/,2023-09-20,"
In a paper titled “Generative Image Dynamics,” a Google research team introduces an innovative approach to model natural oscillation dynamics using a single static image. This approach yields photo-realistic animations derived from a lone image, surpassing the performance of previous methods by a substantial margin.

 ","Motion is one of the most conspicuous visual cues in the natural world, and humans possess a remarkable sensitivity to it. While humans effortlessly perceive motion, training a model to learn realistic scene motion presents substantial challenges due to the intricacies involved in measuring and capturing physical properties on a large scale. Fortunately, recent advancements in generative models, particularly conditional diffusion models, have ushered in a new era of modeling highly intricate and diverse distributions of real images based on text input. Moreover, recent research indicates that extending this modeling to other domains, such as videos and 3D geometry, holds significant potential for downstream applications. In a paper titled “Generative Image Dynamics,” a Google research team introduces an innovative approach to model natural oscillation dynamics using a single static image. This approach yields photo-realistic animations derived from a lone image, surpassing the performance of previous methods by a substantial margin. Furthermore, it opens doors to various other applications, such as the creation of interactive animations. This model is trained on automatically extracted motion trajectories from a large collection of real video sequences. Conditioned on an input image, the trained model predicts a neural stochastic motion texture: a set of coefficients of a motion basis that characterize each pixel’s trajectory into the future. The core of this model’s training process lies in automatically extracted motion trajectories from an extensive collection of real video sequences. Given an input image, the trained model predicts a neural stochastic motion texture, which consists of coefficients representing the motion basis for each pixel’s trajectory into the future. This prediction occurs via a diffusion model, which generates coefficients one frequency at a time while coordinating these predictions across frequency bands. The resulting frequency-space textures can then be converted into dense, long-range pixel motion trajectories. Together with an image-based rendering diffusion model, these trajectories can be employed to synthesize future frames, effectively transforming static images into lifelike animations. In contrast to prior models relying solely on raw RGB pixel data, this motion-based representation captures a more fundamental, lower-dimensional underlying structure that efficiently accounts for variations in pixel values. Consequently, the proposed approach results in more coherent, long-term generation and affords finer control over animations when compared to earlier methods that perform image animation through raw video synthesis. In their empirical study, the research team rigorously compared their approach against several recent single-image animation and video prediction methods. The results clearly demonstrate that their proposed approach beats prior single-image animation benchmarks in terms of both image and video synthesis quality. Overall, this work represents a highly promising breakthrough, capable of generating photo-realistic animations from a single static image while significantly surpassing the performance of previous baseline methods.

Unveiling the Enigma: Meta AI & UPC Decodes the Inner Workings of Large Scale Language Models,https://syncedreview.com/2023/09/20/unveiling-the-enigma-meta-ai-upc-decodes-the-inner-workings-of-large-scale-language-models/,2023-09-20,"
In a new paper Neurons in Large Language Models: Dead, N-gram, Positional, a research team from Meta AI and Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya  conducts comprehensive analysis of a family of Open Pre-trained Transformer Language Models (OPT) up to 66b parameters to provide insights of how feed-forward network (FFN) layers act.
","Recent developments in large-scale language models have showcased their remarkable ability to tackle a wide array of tasks using a single model. However, a significant challenge lies in comprehending their internal workings, particularly as scaling these models up also raises the bar for interpretability. In a new paper titled “Neurons in Large Language Models: Dead, N-gram, Positional,” a research team from Meta AI and the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya embarks on a comprehensive analysis of a family of Open Pre-trained Transformer Language Models (OPT) with parameters ranging up to 66 billion. Their goal is to shed light on how the feed-forward network (FFN) layers function within these models. The team places particular emphasis on the neurons housed within the FFNs. They contend that FFN neurons are more likely to represent meaningful features. The elementwise nonlinearity within these neurons disrupts rotational invariance, prompting features to align with the basis dimensions. Essentially, when an FFN neuron is activated, it updates the residual stream by extracting the corresponding row from the second FFN layer. Conversely, when it remains inactive, it has no impact on the residual stream. Armed with these insights, the researchers can decipher the functions of these FFN neurons by understanding when they activate and interpreting the associated updates made to the residual stream. Their initial observations reveal that a significant portion of neurons never activate across diverse datasets. An analysis of neuron activation frequencies underscores the substantial prevalence of dormant neurons. For instance, in the 66 billion parameter model, some layers exhibit a proportion of dead neurons exceeding 70%. Subsequently, delving deeper into the patterns embedded in the lower half of the models, the researchers investigate how neuron activations correlate with input n-grams. Their findings indicate that in larger models, neurons are covered by fewer n-grams, aligning with the hypothesis that the model allocates discreet shallow patterns to specifically designated neurons. Furthermore, the researchers identify certain neurons responsible for encoding positional information, irrespective of textual patterns. This discovery suggests that FFN layers can be employed by the model in ways that extend beyond the conventional key-value memory perspective. Overall, by conducting analysis of whether an FFN neuron is activated or not on the OPT family of models ranging from 125m to 66b parameters, the team summarizes the discoveries of neurons that: The team asserts that this work represents the first instance of mechanisms specialized in removing information from the residual stream.

Revolutionizing Autonomous Agents: AGENTS Framework Puts Power in Your Hands,https://syncedreview.com/2023/09/18/revolutionizing-autonomous-agents-agents-framework-puts-power-in-your-hands/,2023-09-18,"
In a new paper Agents: An Open-source Framework for Autonomous Language Agents, a research team from AIWaves Inc., Zhejiang University and ETH Zürich releases AGENTS, an open-source framework that enables non-specialists for developing and deploying state-of-the-art autonomous language agents with minimal coding work.
","In recent years, the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has showcased their potential in creating autonomous agents capable of tackling complex tasks and engaging with the world, humans, and fellow agents through a profound understanding of their surroundings. However, despite this promising trajectory, the creation of such agents remains a significant challenge for practitioners, including those with substantial experience in the field. Designing, fine-tuning, and developing new agents demands a considerable amount of effort and expertise. In response to this challenge, a collaborative research team comprising AIWaves Inc., Zhejiang University, and ETH Zürich has introduced “AGENTS,” an open-source framework aimed at empowering individuals, even those without specialized knowledge, to develop and deploy cutting-edge autonomous language agents with minimal coding requirements. The underlying philosophy of the AGENTS framework is to provide user-friendly tools for customizing, fine-tuning, and deploying language agents, making the process accessible even to beginners while retaining flexibility for developers and researchers. The AGENTS framework consists of three primary classes: Agent, Environment, and Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). The former two classes can be initialized using straightforward configuration files filled with plain text. These configuration files serve to define fundamental elements and modularize complex prompts, significantly reducing the effort required from users. The SOP class is pivotal, comprising a graphical representation of an agent’s various states during task execution. It outlines different scenarios an agent may encounter and employs an LLM-based control function to dictate transitions between states and guide the agent’s subsequent actions. SOPs can be generated by an LLM and further customized and fine-tuned by users to suit their specific needs. Additionally, AGENTS offers core features that include tool usage, long-short term memory integration, and multi-agent communication. Notably, it introduces human-agent interaction and controllability for the first time, marking a significant milestone in the development of autonomous agents. In conclusion, the AGENTS framework stands as a testament to its ability to simplify the process of building personalized autonomous language agents for both developers and non-technical users. Its user-friendly approach and robust feature set make it a valuable tool in the advancement of autonomous agent technology. All demos are available at http://www.aiwaves-agents.com/.

DeepMind Decodes the Puzzle of ‘ Grokking ’ In Neural Network Generalization Through Circuit Efficiency,https://syncedreview.com/2023/09/15/deepmind-decodes-the-puzzle-of-grokking-in-neural-network-generalization-through-circuit-efficiency/,2023-09-15,"
In a new paper Explaining grokking through circuit efficiency, a DeepMind research team solves the puzzle of the grokking through circuit efficiency theory, revealing that the generalizing solution is slower to learn then memorizing.
","One of the intriguing puzzles within the realm of neural network generalization is a phenomenon known as “grokking.” It involves a neural network achieving perfect training accuracy but displaying poor generalization capabilities. Interestingly, it has been observed that further training can transform a network experiencing this phenomenon into one that exhibits perfect generalization—a result that challenges our conventional understanding. Typically, we assume that a neural network, once its training loss converges to a low value, should not undergo significant changes. In a recently published paper titled “Explaining Grokking through Circuit Efficiency,” a research team from DeepMind successfully unravels the mystery behind grokking through their circuit efficiency theory. This breakthrough sheds light on why the generalizing solution takes longer to learn compared to memorization. Additionally, the team introduces two novel concepts: “ungrokking” and “semi-grokking,” which contribute to a deeper understanding of neural network generalization. The team summarizes their main contributions as follows: The team’s explanation of grokking revolves around three key factors: the generalizing circuit, efficiency, and the rate of learning. They begin by highlighting the existence of two categories of circuits that yield favorable training outcomes: Building upon this theory and considering behaviors around the critical dataset size, the team makes two groundbreaking predictions, hitherto unreported in previous research: Finally, through rigorous experimentation, the team successfully validates their theory. This achievement not only solves the enigma of grokking but also underscores the potential for a broader comprehension of deep learning by examining it through the lens of circuit efficiency.

"Microsoft’s phi-1.5 Challenges LLMs Scaling Law, Showcases the Crucial Rule for ‘Textbook Quality’ Dataset",https://syncedreview.com/2023/09/14/microsofts-phi-1-5-challenges-llms-scaling-law-showcases-the-crucial-rule-for-textbook-quality-dataset/,2023-09-14,"
A Microsoft research team introduce phi-1.5, a 1.3 billion parameter model trained on a vast dataset of 30 billion tokens, remarkably delivering performance that rivals models five times its size. Moreover, it outperforms most non-frontier LLMs in tackling intricate reasoning tasks.
","Large Language Models (LLMs) have undoubtedly showcased remarkable performance in the field of natural language processing. However, beneath their accomplishments lies a profound and far-reaching impact on the economic landscape, and they have yet to fully redefine the artificial intelligence framework and even cognition itself. On the flip side, the enhancement of LLMs appears to be predominantly driven by their sheer scale. Many of today’s state-of-the-art models approach the staggering realm of trillions of parameters and tokens, demanding substantial resources for training, deployment, and maintenance. This exponential growth in scale inevitably leads to soaring costs. Hence, a pressing question emerges: “How compact can an LLM be while retaining its capabilities?” In a groundbreaking paper titled “Textbooks Are All You Need II: phi-1.5 Technical Report,” a dedicated research team at Microsoft embarks on a quest to explore this inquiry. They introduce phi-1.5, a 1.3 billion parameter model trained on a vast dataset of 30 billion tokens, remarkably delivering performance that rivals models five times its size. Moreover, it outperforms most non-frontier LLMs in tackling intricate reasoning tasks. This endeavor builds upon the foundation laid by phi-1, a pioneering Transformer-based model introduced by Microsoft in June of this year. With a mere 1.3 billion parameters, phi-1 managed to surpass the formidable GPT-3.5, thanks to its utilization of high-quality “textbook” training data. The phi-1.5 model preserves the exact architecture of phi-1, boasting 24 layers, 32 heads, and each head with a dimension of 64. Additional enhancements include the use of rotary embedding, flash-attention for speech training, and the codegen-mono tokenizer. The training data for phi-1.5 comprises a fusion of phi-1’s training data and synthetic “textbook-like” data, meticulously crafted to enhance common-sense reasoning and general knowledge acquisition. The researchers initiated phi-1.5 from random initialization with a constant learning rate of 2e−4, coupled with a weight decay of 0.1. The training process harnessed the Adam optimizer and fp16 with DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 2. In their empirical investigation, the research team subjected phi-1.5 to rigorous evaluation on benchmark natural language tasks, encompassing common sense reasoning, language skills, and multi-step reasoning. The results unequivocally demonstrate that phi-1.5 achieves performance on par with significantly larger models, even surpassing them in the realm of complex reasoning tasks. Collectively, this groundbreaking work challenges the prevailing belief that the prowess of LLMs hinges primarily on their scale. Instead, it underscores the pivotal role played by data quality, suggesting that it may hold the key to unlocking the true potential of these transformative models.

Unlocking the Power of Visual Modeling: Microsoft’s Sparse MoEs Redefine Efficiency and Excellence,https://syncedreview.com/2023/09/12/unlocking-the-power-of-visual-modeling-microsofts-sparse-moes-redefine-efficiency-and-excellence/,2023-09-12,"
An Apple research team introduces the concept of sparse Mobile Vision MoEs (V-MoEs), which represents a streamlined and mobile-friendly Mixture-of-Experts architecture that efficiently downscales Vision Transformers (ViTs) while preserving impressive model performance.
","In recent years, sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts models (sparse MoEs) have garnered substantial attention and acclaim for their remarkable ability to decouple model size from inference efficiency. This enables unprecedented scalability, leading to significant successes across various domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition. Sparse MoEs offer the tantalizing prospect of augmenting model capabilities while simultaneously mitigating computational costs. This makes them an enticing option for integration with Transformers, the prevailing architectural choice for large-scale visual modeling, albeit constrained by their resource-intensive nature. In pursuit of this endeavor, an Apple research team has introduced the concept of sparse Mobile Vision MoEs (V-MoEs) in their paper titled “Mobile V-MoEs: Scaling Down Vision Transformers via Sparse Mixture-of-Experts.” These V-MoEs represent a streamlined and mobile-friendly Mixture-of-Experts architecture that efficiently downscales Vision Transformers (ViTs) while preserving impressive model performance. The team summarizes their main contributions as follows: The core innovation of the proposed sparse Mobile V-MoE lies in its utilization of a single per-image router, as opposed to per-patch routing. The conventional per-patch routing typically necessitates the activation of a larger number of experts for each image. In contrast, the per-image router processes entire images as inputs, thereby reducing the number of activated experts per image. And the architecture comprises ViT layers followed by MoE-ViT layers. It’s important to note that, unlike ViT layers, the MoE-ViT layers feature a distinct Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for each expert, while the remaining portions of the layers are shared across all experts. During the training phase, the researchers adopted a novel approach. They initially trained a dense baseline model and subsequently computed the model’s confusion matrix using a held-out validation set from the training dataset. This confusion matrix served as the foundation for creating a confusion graph, which was further subjected to a graph clustering algorithm. The outcome of this process was a super-class division. This strategy holds promise for enhancing the performance of highly perplexing classes, as different MoE experts specialize in distinct semantic data clusters. The research team applied this training approach in their experiments on ImageNet-1k. The results demonstrated that MoE-ViT offers an improved trade-off between performance and efficiency when compared to dense ViT. This underscores its potential in resource-constrained applications. In summary, sparse Mobile Vision MoEs represent a groundbreaking advancement in the realm of Vision Transformers, promising to revolutionize the field by enabling efficient scalability without sacrificing performance. The innovative training strategy and promising results on ImageNet-1k highlight the considerable potential of MoE-ViT in resource-constrained scenarios.

Revolutionizing Optimization: DeepMind Leverages Large Language Models as Intelligent Optimizers,https://syncedreview.com/2023/09/12/revolutionizing-optimization-deepmind-leverages-large-language-models-as-intelligent-optimizers/,2023-09-12,"
In a new paper Large Language Models as Optimizers, a Google DeepMind research team introduces Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), an effective method that leverages large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, which can generate optimization solutions conditioned on the natural language that describes the optimization task. 
","Optimization plays a pivotal role in a diverse array of real-world applications. Nevertheless, traditional optimization algorithms often demand substantial manual intervention to tailor them to specific tasks, grappling with the intricacies posed by the decision space and performance landscape. To tackle this challenge head-on, a Google DeepMind research team has introduced a groundbreaking approach in their recent paper titled “Large Language Models as Optimizers.” This innovative method, known as Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), harnesses the power of large language models (LLMs) as optimizers. These LLMs are capable of generating optimization solutions based on the natural language that describes the optimization task. The remarkable ability of LLMs to comprehend natural language opens up exciting possibilities for generating optimization solutions based on a problem’s verbal description. Instead of adhering to traditional approaches, which typically define optimization problems formally and employ programmed solvers to derive update steps, this research takes a distinctive path. Here, the researchers guide the optimization process by instructing the LLM to iteratively generate new solutions based on natural language descriptions and previously discovered solutions. To provide an overview of the OPRO framework, a meta-prompt is employed, containing both the description of the optimization problem and previously evaluated solutions. This meta-prompt serves as input, empowering the LLM to generate candidate solutions based on the provided information. Subsequently, these newly generated solutions are assessed and integrated into the meta-prompt for subsequent optimization iterations. This iterative optimization process persists until the LLM can no longer propose solutions with higher scores or reaches the maximum number of optimization steps. In essence, the ultimate objective is to formulate a prompt that maximizes task accuracy. In their empirical investigation, the research team evaluated the OPRO framework across various LLMs, including text-bison, Palm 2-L, gpt-3.5-turbo, and gpt-4. On small-scale traveling salesman problems, OPRO demonstrated performance on par with hand-crafted heuristic algorithms, surpassing human-designed prompts by a substantial margin on GSM8K and Big-Bench Hard, even achieving over a 50% improvement.

Equall & Apple’s Revolutionizing Transformers: One Wide Feedforward for Unprecedented Efficiency and Accuracy,https://syncedreview.com/2023/09/08/equall-apples-revolutionizing-transformers-one-wide-feedforward-for-unprecedented-efficiency-and-accuracy/,2023-09-08,"
A collaborative research effort from Equall and Apple delves into the role of the FFN and uncovers a surprising revelation: despite consuming a significant portion of the model’s parameters, the FFN exhibits high redundancy. As a result, the researchers propose sharing a single FFN across both the encoder and decoder, thereby reducing the parameter count while causing only a modest drop in accuracy.
","The Transformer architecture has demonstrated remarkable scalability, leading to substantial improvements in accuracy. However, this advancement comes at the cost of exceedingly high computational requirements, which have emerged as a significant obstacle in real-world applications. Although researchers have actively pursued solutions to reduce the dimensions of Transformer components and prune elements like attention heads, another critical component, the Feed Forward Network (FFN), has remained relatively underexplored. In a recent paper titled “One Wide Feedforward is All You Need,” a collaborative research effort from Equall and Apple delves into the role of the FFN and uncovers a surprising revelation: despite consuming a significant portion of the model’s parameters, the FFN exhibits high redundancy. As a result, the researchers propose sharing a single FFN across both the encoder and decoder, thereby reducing the parameter count while causing only a modest drop in accuracy. In the Transformer architecture, two main components reign supreme: attention and the FFN. Typically, FFNs occupy roughly two-thirds of the parameter budget, leaving attention with the remaining third. In their study, the researchers explore parameter sharing between the encoder and decoder FFNs, aiming to assess its impact on model accuracy. The overarching objective is to strike a balance between model size, latency, and accuracy. The research team’s primary focus revolves around answering the following questions: To address these questions, the researchers introduce the “One Wide FFN” model, a novel architectural approach that features a single shared wide FFN in the encoder, complemented by an FFN in the decoder. They also employ Linear Centered Kernel Alignment to assess the similarity between internal representations and Local Neighborhood Similarity to gauge semantic space similarity across different models. The results of their study demonstrate that both model accuracy and the internal representations of the Transformer remain stable when employing the One Wide FFN model architecture. Meanwhile, a significant reduction in the number of parameters has been achieved, offering promise for more efficient and practical implementation of Transformer models.

As a result , the researchers propose sharing a single FFN across both the encoder and decoder , thereby reducing the parameter count while causing only a modest drop in accuracy . In the Transformer architecture , two main components reign supreme : attention and the FFN . Typically , FFNs occupy roughly two-thirds of the parameter budget , leaving attention with the remaining third . In their study , the researchers explore parameter sharing between the encoder and decoder FFNs , aiming to assess its impact on model accuracy . The overarching objective is to strike a balance between model size , latency , and accuracy . The research team ’ s primary focus revolves around answering the following questions : To address these questions , the researchers introduce the “ One Wide FFN ” model , a novel architectural approach that features a single shared wide FFN in the encoder , complemented by an FFN in the decoder . They also employ Linear Centered Kernel Alignment to assess the similarity between internal representations and Local Neighborhood Similarity to gauge semantic space similarity across different models . The results of their study demonstrate that both model accuracy and the internal representations of the Transformer remain stable when employing the One Wide FFN model architecture . Meanwhile , a significant reduction in the number of parameters has been achieved , offering promise for more efficient and practical implementation of Transformer models .

Unlocking Limitless Retrieval Power: Google’s MEMORY-VQ Revolutionizes LLMs with Remarkable Compression,https://syncedreview.com/2023/09/06/unlocking-limitless-retrieval-power-googles-memory-vq-revolutionizes-llms-with-remarkable-compression/,2023-09-06,"
In a new paper MEMORY-VQ: Compression for Tractable Internet-Scale Memory, a Google research team introduces MEMORY-VQ, a novel method that significantly reduce storage requirements for memory-based methods while maintaining high performance, achieving 16x compression rate on the KILT benchmark.
","Retrieval augmentation is a commonly employed and effective approach for enhancing the factual knowledge of language models, while simultaneously accelerating model inference times. Nonetheless, this approach comes with considerable computational costs attributed to the substantial storage demands required for storing precomputed representations. To address this pertinent issue, a Google research team has presented a groundbreaking solution in their new paper titled “MEMORY-VQ: Compression for Tractable Internet-Scale Memory.” This innovative method, MEMORY-VQ, significantly diminishes the storage prerequisites associated with memory-based techniques while upholding high performance levels, achieving an impressive 16x compression rate on the KILT benchmark. Remarkably, this endeavor marks a pioneering effort in the realm of compressing pre-encoded token memory representations, as no prior research has explored this avenue. The MEMORY-VQ approach seamlessly blends product quantization with the VQ-VAE method to achieve its primary objective: reducing storage requirements for memory-based methods without compromising quality. The core concept involves employing vector quantization techniques to substitute the original memory vectors with integer codes for memory compression. These codes can then be efficiently transformed back into vectors as needed. By implementing this approach in LUMEN, a potent memory-based technique that pre-computes token representations for retrieved passages to significantly expedite inference, the researchers have developed the LUMEN-VQ model. In their empirical investigation, the research team conducted a comparative analysis, pitting LUMEN-VQ against naïve baselines such as LUMEN-Large and LUMEN-Light, using a subset of knowledge-intensive tasks from the KILT benchmark. Impressively, LUMEN-VQ managed to achieve a remarkable 16x compression rate with only a limited loss in quality. In summary, this research underscores the effectiveness of MEMORY-VQ as a memory augmentation technique and a pragmatic solution for substantially enhancing inference speed when dealing with extensive retrieval corpora.The paper MEMORY-VQ: Compression for Tractable Internet-Scale Memory on arXiv.

MIT’s AskIt Provides A Unified Programming Interface for Code Generation with LLMs,https://syncedreview.com/2023/09/05/mits-askit-provides-a-unified-programming-interface-for-code-generation-with-llms/,2023-09-05,"
In a new paper AskIt: Unified Programming Interface for Programming with Large Language Models, a MIT CSAIL research team presents AskIt, a domain-specific language (DSL) tailored for LLMs to accommodate a wide variety of tasks, which substantially reducing practitioners’ developmental overhead and effort for software.
","Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities in recent years. One of the most intriguing facets of their capabilities is their adeptness across a wide variety of tasks. Researchers have aptly termed this phenomenon as “emergent abilities,” which serves to distinguish LLMs from other language models. However, the integration of LLMs into software development poses significant challenges. This is primarily due to the complex decision-making process involved in embedding them into applications. Additionally, the effective design of prompts remains a substantial concern. To tackle these challenges head-on, a research team from MIT CSAIL has presented a new paper titled “AskIt: Unified Programming Interface for Programming with Large Language Models.” AskIt is a domain-specific language (DSL) designed specifically for LLMs, with the aim of accommodating a wide array of tasks. This innovative approach substantially reduces the developmental overhead and effort required by practitioners in the field of software development. The team summarizes their main contributions as follows: AskIt offers two essential APIs: “ask” and “define.” It boasts a type system that empowers developers to specify the expected output type of a task via synthesized prompts, eliminating the need for manual prompt engineering. Furthermore, its template-based function definitions enable developers to craft functions for specific computational and linguistic tasks by leveraging LLMs. The code generation features of AskIt ensure seamless transitions between integrating an LLM into software and using it for programming. To bring AskIt to life, the team implemented it for TypeScript and developed a DSL compiler as a TypeScript compiler plugin. In the computational flow, the DSL compiler traverses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the input code, converting AskIt APIs into specific TypeScript functions. When “define” is called, the DSL compiler generates the corresponding function. For “ask” or functions defined by “define,” the DSL runtime produces a prompt based on the type information. The LLM consumes the prompt to provide a response, which is then received and parsed by the DSL runtime to extract the answer. In their empirical study, the team implemented AskIt in TypeScript and Python across a diverse tasks, through benchmarking, the results show that AskIt significantly speedup the code generation time, demonstrating its operational efficiency and efficacy.

70 billion parameter LLaMA2 model training accelerated by 195% with best foundation model practice upgraded,https://syncedreview.com/2023/09/04/70-billion-parameter-llama2-model-training-accelerated-by-195-with-best-foundation-model-practice-upgraded/,2023-09-04,"
Colossal-AI provides revolutionary LLaMA2 training efficiency for 8 to 512 GPUs, fine-tuning, and inference solutions. The 70 billion parameter training can be accelerated by 195%, and provides a fully-managed ML cloud platform solution, greatly reducing the cost of large model development and applications.
","Initially triggered by ChatGPT, the large model boom is continuing to intensify. Tech giants and star startups are scrambling to contribute models for the competitive and diversified commercial market. Among these models, the LLaMA series has accumulated a vast amount of users and practical applications due to its basic capabilities and open ecology. For countless open-source model latecomers, it has become a benchmark model for imitation and comparison. However, key bottlenecks still exist for AIGC-related enterprises, including questions about how developers can reduce pre-training costs of big models like LLaMA2, as well as how they can build these models practically using continual pre-training and fine-tuning. As the world’s largest and most active community for large model development tools, Colossal-AI provides revolutionary LLaMA2 training efficiency for 8 to 512 GPUs, fine-tuning, and inference solutions. The 70 billion parameter training can be accelerated by 195%, and provides a fully-managed ML cloud platform solution, greatly reducing the cost of large model development and applications. Open source address: https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI Meta’s open-source large model series, LLaMA, further stimulated the enthusiasm for creating models like ChatGPT, which has inspired the development of many projects and applications. The latest 7B~70B LLaMA2 model further improves the basic capabilities of the language model. However, since most of the pre-training information for LLaMA2 is derived from English generalized knowledge, the domain information and multilingual capabilities that can be enhanced and injected with fine-tuning are relatively limited. Additionally, high-quality datasets and expertise are typically regarded as core assets of companies and kept in a privatized form. Considering the increase of high-quality private business data, pre-training/fine-tuning the LLaMA2 series of big models efficiently but cheaply is an urgent necessity for many industries and companies. However, LLaMA2 big models only release the original model weights and inference scripts which do not support training/fine-tuning or datasets. To address the needs mentioned above, Colossal-AI has open sourced a full-flow solution for LLaMA2 with high scalability. This supports models ranging from 7 to 70 billion parameters, while still maintaining good performance from 8 to 512 GPUs. When training/fine-tuning LLaMA2-7B using 8 GPUs, Colossal-AI is able to achieve an industry-leading hardware utilization (MFU) of about 54%. As for pre-training, when LLaMA2-70B was pre-trained with 512 A100 40GB, the DeepSpeed ZeRO3 strategy could not be activated due to insufficient GPU memory. This strategy could only be activated using ZeRO3-offload with a large speed decay. Colossal-AI, on the other hand, still maintains good performance and a training speedup of 195% due to its excellent system optimization and scalability. The high performance of Colossal-AI’s LLaMA-2 training/fine-tuning comes from system optimizations such as the new heterogeneous memory management system Gemini, and high-performance operators like Flash attention 2. Gemini provides highly scalable, robust, and easily usable interfaces. Its format, Checkpoint, is also fully compatible with HuggingFace, reducing usage and conversion costs. It is more flexible for cuts, offloads, etc., covering more hardware configurations for LLaMA-2 training/fine-tuning tasks. All of these advantages can be used with just a few lines of code:  Although Colossal-AI’s Gemini already performs well for a mainstream hardware model, for some extreme hardware conditions or special models, fine-grained optimizations with multi-dimensional parallelism may be needed. Other existing solutions usually require veterans in distributed systems to manually refactor and tune the code to scale, but Colossal-AI’s ShardFormer provides incredible multi-dimensional parallelism and operators optimization capabilities. This can be utilized with a few lines of code while providing good performance on both a standalone server/large-scale clusters. Colossal-AI’s ShardFormer supports mainstream open source models including LLaMA1/2, BLOOM, OPT, T5, GPT-2, BERT, GLM, etc. Huggingface/transformers models can be imported directly. The Checkpoint format is also fully compatible with HuggingFace, greatly improving the usability compared to Megatron-LM and other projects that require lots of rewritten code. For the parallel strategy, it has supported the following multiple parallel methods: tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism, sequence parallelism, data parallelism, Zero data parallelism, etc. It can even combine multiple parallel methods to adapt to various complex hardware environments/models with simple configuration commands. Furthermore, it has a variety of built-in high-performance operators, eliminating the need for a tedious compatibility/configuration process. These include: In order to further improve development and deployment efficiency, the Colossal-AI team also combines advantages of the systems above with computational resources to provide the Colossal-AI Cloud Platform. This offers cheap computational power and mainstream AI applications, including dialog big models, multimodal models, biomedicine, etc. The invitation for internal testing is now open. By shielding underlying distributed parallel computing, memory, communication management and optimization of large models, AI developers can focus on the model and algorithm design. This completes the AI model at a lower cost and faster speed, ultimately reducing business costs while increasing efficiency. Users only need to upload relevant data to train personalized private models without code and can deploy the trained models with one click. The application has been carefully optimized by the Colossal-AI team, and thanks to the optimization of algorithms and systems, the cost of model training and deployment can be reduced immensely.
