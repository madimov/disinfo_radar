OpenAI teases an amazing new generative video model called Sora,https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/02/15/1088401/openai-amazing-new-generative-ai-video-model-sora/,2024-02-15,"<p>The firm is sharing Sora with a small group of safety testers but the rest of us will have to wait to learn more.</p>
","OpenAI has built a striking new generative video model called Sora that can take a short text description and turn it into a detailed, high-definition film clip up to a minute long. Based on four sample videos that OpenAI shared with MIT Technology Review ahead of today’s announcement, the San Francisco–based firm has pushed the envelope of what’s possible with text-to-video generation (a hot new research direction that we flagged as a trend to watch in 2024). “We think building models that can understand video, and understand all these very complex interactions of our world, is an important step for all future AI systems,” says Tim Brooks, a scientist at OpenAI. But there’s a disclaimer. OpenAI gave us a preview of Sora (which means sky in Japanese) under conditions of strict secrecy. In an unusual move, the firm would only share information about Sora if we agreed to wait until after news of the model was made public to seek the opinions of outside experts. [Editor’s note: We’ve updated this story with outside comment below.] OpenAI has not yet released a technical report or demonstrated the model actually working. And it says it won’t be releasing Sora anytime soon. [Update: OpenAI has now shared more technical details on its website.] The first generative models that could produce video from snippets of text appeared in late 2022. But early examples from Meta, Google, and a startup called Runway were glitchy and grainy. Since then, the tech has been getting better fast. Runway’s gen-2 model, released last year, can produce short clips that come close to matching big-studio animation in their quality. But most of these examples are still only a few seconds long.   The sample videos from OpenAI’s Sora are high-definition and full of detail. OpenAI also says it can generate videos up to a minute long. One video of a Tokyo street scene shows that Sora has learned how objects fit together in 3D: the camera swoops into the scene to follow a couple as they walk past a row of shops. Exclusive: Watch the world premiere of the AI-generated short film The Frost. OpenAI also claims that Sora handles occlusion well. One problem with existing models is that they can fail to keep track of objects when they drop out of view. For example, if a truck passes in front of a street sign, the sign might not reappear afterward.   In a video of a papercraft underwater scene, Sora has added what look like cuts between different pieces of footage, and the model has maintained a consistent style between them. It’s not perfect. In the Tokyo video, cars to the left look smaller than the people walking beside them. They also pop in and out between the tree branches. “There’s definitely some work to be done in terms of long-term coherence,” says Brooks. “For example, if someone goes out of view for a long time, they won’t come back. The model kind of forgets that they were supposed to be there.” Impressive as they are, the sample videos shown here were no doubt cherry-picked to show Sora at its best. Without more information, it is hard to know how representative they are of the model’s typical output.    It may be some time before we find out. OpenAI’s announcement of Sora today is a tech tease, and the company says it has no current plans to release it to the public. Instead, OpenAI will today begin sharing the model with third-party safety testers for the first time. In particular, the firm is worried about the potential misuses of fake but photorealistic video. “We’re being careful about deployment here and making sure we have all our bases covered before we put this in the hands of the general public,” says Aditya Ramesh, a scientist at OpenAI, who created the firm’s text-to-image model DALL-E. But OpenAI is eyeing a product launch sometime in the future. As well as safety testers, the company is also sharing the model with a select group of video makers and artists to get feedback on how to make Sora as useful as possible to creative professionals. “The other goal is to show everyone what is on the horizon, to give a preview of what these models will be capable of,” says Ramesh. To build Sora, the team adapted the tech behind DALL-E 3, the latest version of OpenAI’s flagship text-to-image model. Like most text-to-image models, DALL-E 3 uses what’s known as a diffusion model. These are trained to turn a fuzz of random pixels into a picture. Sora takes this approach and applies it to videos rather than still images. But the researchers also added another technique to the mix. Unlike DALL-E or most other generative video models, Sora combines its diffusion model with a type of neural network called a transformer. Transformers are great at processing long sequences of data, like words. That has made them the special sauce inside large language models like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google DeepMind’s Gemini. But videos are not made of words. Instead, the researchers had to find a way to cut videos into chunks that could be treated as if they were. The approach they came up with was to dice videos up across both space and time. “It’s like if you were to have a stack of all the video frames and you cut little cubes from it,” says Brooks. The transformer inside Sora can then process these chunks of video data in much the same way that the transformer inside a large language model processes words in a block of text. The researchers say that this let them train Sora on many more types of video than other text-to-video models, varied in terms of resolution, duration, aspect ratio, and orientation. “It really helps the model,” says Brooks. “That is something that we’re not aware of any existing work on.” “From a technical perspective it seems like a very significant leap forward,” says Sam Gregory, executive director at Witness, a human rights organization that specializes in the use and misuse of video technology. “But there are two sides to the coin,” he says. “The expressive capabilities offer the potential for many more people to be storytellers using video. And there are also real potential avenues for misuse.”  OpenAI is well aware of the risks that come with a generative video model. We are already seeing the large-scale misuse of deepfake images. Photorealistic video takes this to another level. Gregory notes that you could use technology like this to misinform people about conflict zones or protests. The range of styles is also interesting, he says. If you could generate shaky footage that looked like something shot with a phone, it would come across as more authentic.  The tech is not there yet, but generative video has gone from zero to Sora in just 18 months. “We’re going to be entering a universe where there will be fully synthetic content, human-generated content and a mix of the two,” says Gregory.  The OpenAI team plans to draw on the safety testing it did last year for DALL-E 3. Sora already includes a filter that runs on all prompts sent to the model that will block requests for violent, sexual, or hateful images, as well as images of known people. Another filter will look at frames of generated videos and block material that violates OpenAI’s safety policies. OpenAI says it is also adapting a fake-image detector developed for DALL-E 3 to use with Sora. And the company will embed industry-standard C2PA tags, metadata that states how an image was generated, into all of Sora’s output. But these steps are far from foolproof. Fake-image detectors are hit-or-miss. Metadata is easy to remove, and most social media sites strip it from uploaded images by default.   “We’ll definitely need to get more feedback and learn more about the types of risks that need to be addressed with video before it would make sense for us to release this,” says Ramesh. Brooks agrees. “Part of the reason that we’re talking about this research now is so that we can start getting the input that we need to do the work necessary to figure out how it could be safely deployed,” he says.

Visions of how this technology could deeply alter the ways we work, learn, and live have also accelerated conversations—and breathless media headlines—about how and whether these technologies can be responsibly used. Responsible technology use, of course, is nothing new. The term encompasses a broad range of concerns, from the bias that might be hidden inside algorithms, to the data privacy rights of the users of an application, to the environmental impacts of a new way of work. Rebecca Parsons, CTO emerita at the technology consultancy Thoughtworks, collects all of these concerns under “building an equitable tech future,” where, as new technology is deployed, its benefits are equally shared. “As technology becomes more important in significant aspects of people’s lives,” she says, “we want to think of a future where the tech works right for everyone.” Technology use often goes wrong, Parsons notes, “because we’re too focused on either our own ideas of what good looks like or on one particular audience as opposed to a broader audience.” That may look like an app developer building only for an imagined customer who shares his geography, education, and affluence, or a product team that doesn’t consider what damage a malicious actor could wreak in their ecosystem. “We think people are going to use my product the way I intend them to use my product, to solve the problem I intend for them to solve in the way I intend for them to solve it,” says Parsons. “But that’s not what happens when things get out in the real world.” AI, of course, poses some distinct social and ethical challenges. Some of the technology’s unique challenges are inherent in the way that AI works: its statistical rather than deterministic nature, its identification and perpetuation of patterns from past data (thus reinforcing existing biases), and its lack of awareness about what it doesn’t know (resulting in hallucinations). And some of its challenges stem from what AI’s creators and users themselves don’t know: the unexamined bodies of data underlying AI models, the limited explainability of AI outputs, and the technology’s ability to deceive users into treating it as a reasoning human intelligence. Parsons believes, however, that AI has not changed responsible tech so much as it has brought some of its problems into a new focus. Concepts of intellectual property, for example, date back hundreds of years, but the rise of large language models (LLMs) has posed new questions about what constitutes fair use when a machine can be trained to emulate a writer’s voice or an artist’s style. “It’s not responsible tech if you're violating somebody’s intellectual property, but thinking about that was a whole lot more straightforward before we had LLMs,” she says. The principles developed over many decades of responsible technology work still remain relevant during this transition. Transparency, privacy and security, thoughtful regulation, attention to societal and environmental impacts, and enabling wider participation via diversity and accessibility initiatives remain the keys to making technology work toward human good. MIT Technology Review Insights’ 2023 report with Thoughtworks, “The state of responsible technology,” found that executives are taking these considerations seriously. Seventy-three percent of business leaders surveyed, for example, agreed that responsible technology use will come to be as important as business and financial considerations when making technology decisions.  This AI moment, however, may represent a unique opportunity to overcome barriers that have previously stalled responsible technology work. Lack of senior management awareness (cited by 52% of those surveyed as a top barrier to adopting responsible practices) is certainly less of a concern today: savvy executives are quickly becoming fluent in this new technology and are continually reminded of its potential consequences, failures, and societal harms. The other top barriers cited were organizational resistance to change (46%) and internal competing priorities (46%). Organizations that have realigned themselves behind a clear AI strategy, and who understand its industry-altering potential, may be able to overcome this inertia and indecision as well. At this singular moment of disruption, when AI provides both the tools and motivation to redesign many of the ways in which we work and live, we can fold responsible technology principles into that transition—if we choose to. For her part, Parsons is deeply optimistic about humans’ ability to harness AI for good, and to work around its limitations with common-sense guidelines and well-designed processes with human guardrails. “As technologists, we just get so focused on the problem we’re trying to solve and how we’re trying to solve it,” she says. “And all responsible tech is really about is lifting your head up, and looking around, and seeing who else might be in the world with me.” To read more about Thoughtworks’ analysis and recommendations on responsible technology, visit its Looking Glass 2024.

For her part , Parsons is deeply optimistic about humans ’ ability to harness AI for good , and to work around its limitations with common-sense guidelines and well-designed processes with human guardrails . “ As technologists , we just get so focused on the problem we ’ re trying to solve and how we ’ re trying to solve it , ” she says . “ And all responsible tech is really about is lifting your head up , and looking around , and seeing who else might be in the world with me. ” To read more about Thoughtworks ’ analysis and recommendations on responsible technology , visit its Looking Glass 2024 .

Google’s new version of Gemini can handle far bigger amounts of data,https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/02/15/1088367/googles-new-version-of-gemini-can-handle-far-bigger-amounts-of-data/,2024-02-15,"<p>The updated AI model can now do some seriously impressive things with long videos or text.</p>
","Google DeepMind today launched the next generation of its powerful artificial-intelligence model Gemini, which has an enhanced ability to work with large amounts of video, text, and images. It’s an advancement from the three versions of Gemini 1.0 that Google announced back in December, ranging in size and complexity from Nano to Pro to Ultra. (It rolled out Gemini 1.0 Pro and 1.0 Ultra across many of its products last week.) Google is now releasing a preview of Gemini 1.5 Pro to select developers and business customers. The company says that the mid-tier Gemini 1.5 Pro matches its previous top-tier model, Gemini 1.0 Ultra, in performance but uses less computing power (yes, the names are confusing!).  Crucially, the 1.5 Pro model can handle much larger amounts of data from users, including bigger prompts. While every AI model has a ceiling on how much data it can digest, the standard version of the new Gemini 1.5 Pro can handle inputs as large as 128,000 tokens, which are words or parts of words that an AI model breaks inputs into. That’s on a par with the best version of GPT-4 (GPT-4 Turbo).  However, a limited group of developers will be able to submit up to 1 million tokens to Gemini 1.5 Pro, which equates to roughly one hour of video, 11 hours of audio, or 700,000 words of text. That’s a significant jump that makes it possible to do things that no other models are currently capable of. In one demonstration video shown by Google, using the million-token version, researchers fed the model a 402-page transcript of the Apollo moon landing mission. Then they showed Gemini a hand-drawn sketch of a boot, and asked it to identify the moment in the transcript that the drawing represents. “This is the moment Neil Armstrong landed on the moon,” the chatbot responded correctly. “He said, ‘One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.’” Gmail, Docs, and more will now come with Gemini baked in. But Europeans will have to wait before they can download the app. The model was also able to identify moments of humor. When asked by the researchers to find a funny moment in the Apollo transcript, it picked out when astronaut Mike Collins referred to Armstrong as “the Czar.” (Probably not the best line, but you get the point.)   In another demonstration, the team uploaded a 44-minute silent film featuring Buster Keaton and asked the AI to identify what information was on a piece of paper that, at some point in the movie, is removed from a character’s pocket. In less than a minute, the model found the scene and correctly recalled the text written on the paper. Researchers also repeated a similar task from the Apollo experiment, asking the model to find a scene in the film on the basis of a drawing. It completed this task too.  Google says it put Gemini 1.5 Pro through the usual battery of tests it uses when developing large language models, including evaluations that combine text, code, images, audio, and video. It found that 1.5 Pro outperformed 1.0 Pro on 87% of the benchmarks and more or less matched 1.0 Ultra across all of them while using less computing power.  The ability to handle larger inputs, Google says, is a result of progress in what’s called mixture-of-experts architecture. An AI using this design divides its neural network into chunks, activating only the parts that are relevant to the task at hand rather than firing up the whole network at once. (Google is not alone in using this architecture; the French AI firm Mistral released a model using it, and GPT-4 is rumored to employ the tech as well.) “In one way it operates much like our brain does, where not the whole brain activates all the time,” says Oriol Vinyals, a deep learning team lead at DeepMind. This compartmentalizing saves the AI computing power and can generate responses faster. “That kind of fluidity going back and forth across different modalities, and using that to search and understand, is very impressive,” says Oren Etzioni, former technical director of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, who was not involved in the work. “This is stuff I have not seen before.” An AI that can operate across modalities would more closely resemble the way that human beings behave. “People are naturally multimodal,” Etzioni says; we can effortlessly switch between speaking, writing, and drawing images or charts to convey ideas.  Etzioni cautioned against taking too much meaning from the developments, however. “There’s a famous line,” he says. “Never trust an AI demo.”  For one thing, it’s not clear how much the demonstration videos left out or cherry-picked from various tasks (Google indeed received criticism for its early Gemini launch for not disclosing that the video was sped up). It’s also possible the model would not be able to replicate some of the demonstrations if the input wording were slightly tweaked. AI models in general, says Etzioni, are brittle.  Today’s release of Gemini 1.5 Pro is limited to developers and enterprise customers. Google did not specify when it will be available for wider release.  ","Google DeepMind today launched the next generation of its powerful artificial-intelligence model Gemini , which has an enhanced ability to work with large amounts of video , text , and images .

Amid the proliferation of e-commerce and shifting demand within the consumer-packaged goods (CPG) sector, AI and machine learning (ML) have become helpful tools in enabling efficiency and better business outcomes. The journey toward successfully deployed machine learning operations (MLOps) starts with data, says global head of machine learning operations and platforms at Kraft Heinz Company, Jorge Balestra. Curating well-organized and accessible data means enterprises can leverage their data volumes to train and develop AI and machine learning models. A strong data strategy lays the foundation for these AI and machine learning tools to use data to detect supply chain disruptions, identify and address cost inefficiencies, and predict demand for products. ""Never forget that data is the fuel, and data, it takes effort, it is a journey, it never ends, because that's what is really what I would call what differentiates a lot of successful efforts compared to unsuccessful ones,"" says Balestra. This is especially crucial but challenging within the CPG sector where data is often incomplete given the inconsistent methods for consumer habit tracking among different retailers. He explains, ""We don't know exactly and we don't even want to know exactly what people are doing in their daily lives. What we want is just to get enough of the data so we can provide the right product for our consumers."" To deploy AI and machine learning tools at scale, the Heinz Kraft Company has turned to the flexibility of the cloud. Using the cloud can allow for much-needed data accessibility while mitigating compute power.  ""The agility of the whole thing increases exponentially because what used to take months, now can be done in a matter of seconds via code. So, definitely, I see how all of this explosion around analytics, around AI, is possible, because of cloud really powering all of these initiatives that are popping up left, right, and center."" says Balestra. While it may be challenging to predict future trends in a sector so prone to change, Balestra says that preparing for the road ahead means focusing on adaptability and agility. ""Our mission is to delight people via food. And the technology, AI or what have you, is our tool to excel at our mission. Being able to learn how to leverage existing and future [technology] to get the right product at the right price, at the right location is what we are all about."" This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Infosys Topaz and Infosys Cobalt. Laurel Ruma: From MIT Technology Review, I'm Laurel Ruma, and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace. Our topic is machine learning in the food and beverage industry. AI offers opportunities for innovation for customers and operational efficiencies for employees, but having a data strategy in place to capture these benefits is crucial. Two words for you: global innovation. My guest is Jorge Balestra, global head of machine learning operations and platforms at Kraft Heinz Company. This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Infosys Topaz and Infosys Cobalt. Welcome, Jorge. Jorge Balestra: Thank you very much. Glad to be here. Laurel: Well, wonderful to have you. So people are likely familiar with Kraft Heinz since it is one of the world's largest food and beverage companies. Could you talk to us about your role at Kraft Heinz and how machine learning can help consumers in the grocery aisle? Jorge: Certainly. My role, I will call, has two major focuses in two areas. One of them is I lead the machine learning engineering operations of the company globally. And on the other hand, I provide all of the analytical platforms that the company is using also on a global basis. So in role number one in my machine learning engineering and operations, what my team does is we grab all of these models that our community of data scientists that are working globally are coming up with, and we grabbed them and we strengthened it. Our major mission here is the first thing we need to do is we need to make sure that we are applying engineering practices to make them production ready and they can scale, they can also run in a cost-effective manner, and from there we ensure that in my operations hat they are there when needed. So a lot of these models, because they become part of our day-to-day operations, they're going to come with certain specific service level commitments that we need to make, so my team makes sure that we are delivering on those with the right expectations. And on my other hand, which is the analytical platforms, is that we do a lot of descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive work in terms of analytics. The descriptive portion where you're talking about just the regular dashboarding, summarization piece around our data and where the data lives, all of those analytical platforms that the company is using are also something that I take care of. And with that, you would think that I have a very broad base of customers in the company both in terms of geographies where they are from some of our businesses in Asia, all the way to North America, but also across the organization from marketing to HR and everything in between. Going into your other question about how machine learning is helping our consumers in the grocery aisle, I'll probably summarize that for a CPG it's all about having the right product at the right price, at the right location for you. What that means is on the right product, their machine learning can help a lot of our marketing teams, for example, even when they are now with the latest generative AI capabilities are showing up like brainstorming and creating new content to R&D, what we're trying to figure out what is the best formulas for our products, there's definitely now ML is making inroads in that space, the right price, all about cost efficiencies throughout from our plans to our distribution centers, making sure that we are eliminating waste. Leveraging machine learning capabilities is something that we are doing across the board from our revenue management, which is the right price for people to buy our products. And then last but not least is the right location. So we need to make sure that when our consumers are going into their stores or are buying our products online that the product is there for you and you're going to find the product you like, the flavor you like immediately. And so there is a huge effort around predicting our demand, organizing our supply chain, our distribution, scheduling our plans to make sure that we are producing the right quantities and delivering them to the right places so our consumers can find our products. Laurel: Well, that certainly makes sense since data does play such a crucial role in deploying advanced technologies, especially machine learning. So how does Kraft Heinz ensure the accessibility, quality and security of all of that data at the right place at the right time to drive effective machine learning operations or MLOps? Are there specific best practices that you've discovered? Jorge: Well, the best practice that I can probably advise people on is definitely data is the fuel of machine learning. So without data, there is no modeling. And data, organizing your data, both the data that you have internally and externally takes time. Making sure that it's not only accessible and you are organizing it in a way that you don't have a gazillion technologies to deal with is important, but also I would say the curation of it. That is a long-term commitment. So I strongly advise anyone that is listening right now to understand that your data journey, as it is, is a journey, it doesn't have an end destination, and also it's going to take time. And the more you are successful in terms of getting all the data that you need organized and making sure that is available, the more successful you're going to be leveraging all of that with models in machine learning and great things that are there to actually then accomplish a specific business outcome. So a good metaphor that I like to say is there's a lot of researchers, and MIT is known for its research, but the researchers cannot do anything without the librarians, with all the people that's organizing the knowledge around so you can go and actually do what you need to do, which is in this case research. Never forget that data is the fuel, and data, it takes effort, it is a journey, it never ends, because that's what is really what I would call what differentiates a lot of successful efforts compared to unsuccessful ones. Laurel: Getting back to that right place at the right time mentality, within the last few years, the consumer packaged goods, or you mentioned earlier, the CPG sector, has seen such major shifts from changing customer demands to the proliferation of e-commerce channels. So how can AI and machine learning tools help influence business outcomes or improve operational efficiency? Jorge: I've got two examples that I can say. One is, well, obviously we all want to forget about what happened during the pandemic, but for us it was a key, very challenging time, because out of nowhere all of our supply chains got disrupted, our consumers needed our products more than ever because there were more hunkered down at home. So one of the things that I tell you, at least for us, that was key was through our modeling, through the data that we've had, we've had some good early warning of certain disruptions in the supply chain and we were able to at least get... Especially when the outbreak started, a couple of weeks in advance, we were moving product, we were taking early actions in terms of ensuring that we were delivering an increased amount of product that was needed. And that was because we had the data and we had some of those models that were alerting us about, ""Hey, something is wrong here, something is happening with our supply chain, you need to take action."" And taking action at the right time, it's key in terms of getting ahead of a lot of the things that can happen. And in our case, obviously we live in a competitive world, so taking actions before competition is important, that timing component. Another example I can give you and is more of something that is we're doing more and more nowadays is this piece that I was referring to about the right location about product availability is key for CPG, and that is measured in something that is called the CFR, and is the customer field rate, which means is when someone is ordering product from Kraft Heinz that we are able to fulfill that order to 100%, and we are expecting to be really high with high 90s in terms of how efficient we are filling those orders. We have developed new technology that I think we are pretty proud of because I think it is unique within CPG that allows us to really predict what is going to happen with CFR in the future based on the specific actions we're taking today, whereas it's changing our production lines, whereas changes in distribution, et cetera, we're able to see not only the immediate effect, but what's going to happen in the future with that CFR so we can really act on it and deliver actions right now that are in the benefit of our distribution in the future. So those are, I would call it, say, two examples in terms of how we're leveraging AI and machine learning tools in our day-to-day operations. Laurel: Are those examples, the CFR as well as the supply chain and making sure consumers had everything on demand almost, is this unique to the food and beverage industry? And what are perhaps some other unique challenges that the food and beverage industry faces when you're implementing AI and machine learning innovations? And how do you navigate challenges like that? Jorge: Yeah, I think something that is very unique for us is that we always have to deal with an incomplete picture in terms of the data that we have in our consumers. So if you think about it, when you go into a grocery store, a couple of things, well, you are buying from that store, the Kroger's, Walmart's, et cetera, and some of those will have you identified in terms of what is your consumption patterns, some will not. But also, in our case, if you are going to go buy a Philadelphia [cream cheese], for example, you may choose to buy your Philadelphia in multiple outlets. Sometimes you want more and you go to Costco, sometimes you need less, in my case, I live in the Chicago land area, I go to a Jewel supermarket. We always have to deal with incomplete data on our customers, and that is a challenge because what we are trying to figure out is how to better serve our consumers based on what product you like, where you're buying them, what is the right price point for you, but we're always dealing with data that is incomplete. So in this case, having a clear data strategy around what we have there and a clear understanding of the markets that we have out there so we can really grab that incomplete data that we have out there and still come up with the right actions in terms of what are the right products to put, just to give you an example, a clear example of it is... And I'm going back to Philadelphia because, by the way, that's my favorite Kraft product ever... Laurel: Philadelphia cream cheese, right? Jorge: Yes, absolutely. It's followed by a close second with our ketchup. I have a soft spot for Philadelphia, pun intended. Laurel: – and the ketchup. Jorge: Exactly. No, but you have different presentations. You have the spreadable, you have the brick of cream cheese, within the brick you have some flavors, and what we want to do is make sure that we are providing the flavors that people really want, not producing the ones that people don't want, because that's just waste, without knowing specifically who is buying on the other side and you want to buy it in a supermarket, one or two, or sometimes you are shifting. But those are the things that we are constantly on the lookout for, and obviously dealing with the reality about, hey, data is going to be incomplete. We don't know exactly and we don't even want to know exactly what people are doing in their daily lives. What we want is just to get enough of the data so we can provide the right product for our consumers. Laurel: And an example like cream cheese and ketchup probably, especially if a kid is in the house, it's one of those products that you use on a fairly daily basis. So knowing all of this, how does Kraft Heinz prepare data for AI projects, because that in itself is a project? So what are the first steps to get ready for AI? Jorge: One thing that we have been pretty successful on is what I would call the potluck approach for data. Meaning that individual projects, individual groups are focused on delivering a very specific use case, and that is the right thing to do. When you are dealing with a project in supply chain and you're trying just to, for example, say, ""Hey, I want to optimize my CFR,"" you are really not going to be caring that much about what sales wants to do. However, if you implement a potluck approach, meaning that, okay, you need data from somebody else, and it's very likely that you have data to offer because that's part of your use case. So the potluck approach means that if you want to try out the food of somebody else, you need to bring your own to the table. So if you do that, what starts happening is your data, your enterprise data, becomes little by little more accessible, and if you do it right eventually you pretty much have a lot and almost everything in there. That is one thing that I will strongly advise people to do. Think big, think strategically, but act tactically, act knowing that individual projects, they're going to have more limited scope, but if you establish certain practices around sharing around how data should be managed, then each individual projects are going to be contributing to the larger strategy without the largest strategy being a burden for the individual projects, if that makes sense. Laurel: Sure. Jorge: So at least for us that has been pretty successful over time. So we have data challenges absolutely as everybody else has, but at least from what I've been able to hear from other people, but Kraft Heinz is in a good place in terms of that availability. Because once you reach a certain critical mass, what ends up happening is there's no need to bring additional data, you are always now reusing it because data is large but it's finite. So it's not infinite. It's not something that's going to grow forever. If you do it right, you should see that eventually, you don't need to bring in more and more data. You just need to fine-tune and really leverage the data that you have, probably be more granular, and probably get it faster. That's a good signal. I have the data, but I need it faster because I need to act on it. Great, you're on the right track. And also your associated cost around data should reflect that. It should not grow to infinity. Data is large but is finite. Laurel: So speaking of getting data quickly and making use of it, how does Kraft Heinz use compute power and the cloud scaling ability for AI projects? How do you see these two strategies coming together? Jorge: Definitely the technology has come a long way in the last few years, because what cloud is offering is more of that flexibility, and it's removing a lot of the limitations, both in terms of the scale and performance we used to have. So to give you an example, a few years back I had to worry about “Do I have enough storage in my servers to host all the data that we are getting in?” And then if I didn't, how long is it going to take for me to add another server? With the cloud as an enabler, that's no longer an issue. It's a few lines of code and you get what you need. Also, especially on the data side, some of the more modern technologies, talking about Snowflake or BigQuery, enable you to separate your compute from your storage. What it basically means in practical terms is you don't have people fighting over limited compute power. So data can be the same for everyone and everybody can be accessing the data without having to overlap each other and then fighting about, oh, if you run this, I cannot run that, and then we have all sorts of problems so definitely what the cloud allowed us to do is get out of the way in terms of the technology as a limitation. And the great thing that happened down there now with all the AI projects is now you could focus on actually delivering on the use cases that you have without having to have limitations around “how am I going to scale?”. That is no longer the case. You have to worry about costs because it could cost you an arm and a leg, but not necessarily around how to scale and how long it's going to take you to scale. The agility of the whole thing increases exponentially because what used to take months, now can be done in a matter of seconds via code. So definitely I see how all of this explosion around analytics, around AI is possible, because of cloud really powering all of these initiatives that are popping up left, right, and center. Laurel: And speaking about this, you can't really go it alone, so how do partners like Infosys help bring in those new skills and industry know-how to help build the overall digital strategy for data, AI, cloud, and whatever comes next? Jorge: Much in the same way that I think cloud has been an enabler in terms of this, I think companies and partners like Infosys are also that kind of enablers, because, in a way, they are part of what I would call an expertise ecosystem. I don't think any company nowadays can do any of this on its own. You need partners. You need partners that both are bringing in new ideas, new technology, but also they are bringing in the right level of expertise in terms of people that you need, and in a global sense, at least for us, having someone that has a global footprint is important because we are a global company. So I will say that it's the same thing that we talked about earlier about cloud being an enabler: that expert ecosystem represented by companies like Infosys is just another key enabler without which you will really struggle to deliver. So that's what I'll probably say to anyone that is listening right now, make sure that your ecosystem, your expert ecosystem is good and is thriving and you have the right partners for the right job. Laurel: When you think about the future and also all these tough problems that you're tackling at Kraft Heinz, how important will something like synthetic data be to your data strategy and business strategy as well? What is synthetic data? And then what are some of those challenges associated with using it to fill in the gaps for real-world data? Jorge: In our case, we don't use a lot of synthetic data nowadays because at least from the areas that we have holes to fill in terms of data is something that we've been dealing with for a while. So we are, let's put it this way, already familiar on how to produce and fill in the gaps using some of the synthetic data techniques, but not really to the same extent as other organizations are. So we are still looking for opportunities when that is the case in terms of what we need to use and leverage synthetic data, but it's not something that least for Kraft Heinz and CPG at all we use extensively in multiple places as other organizations are. Laurel: And so, lastly, when you think ahead to the future, what will the digital operating model for an AI-first firm that's focused on data look like? What do you see for the future? Jorge: What I see for the future is, well, first of all, uncertainty, meaning that I don't think we can predict exactly what's going to happen because the area in particular is growing and evolving at a speed that I think is just honestly dazzling just because of the major things. I think at least what I would say is the real muscle that we need to be exercising and be ready for is adaptability. Meaning that we can learn, we can react, and apply all of the new things that are coming in hopefully at the same speed that they're occurring and really leveraging new opportunities when they present themselves in an agile way. But at least from the how to prepare for it I think it's more about preparing the organization, your team, to be ready for that, really act on it, and be ready also to understand the specific business challenges that are there, and look for opportunities where any of the new things or maybe existences that are happening can be applied to solve a specific problem. We are a CPG company, and that means the right product, right price, right location, so anything boils down to how can I be better in those three dimensions leveraging whatever is available today, whatever's going to be available tomorrow. But keep focusing on, at least for us, we are a CPG company, we manufacture in Philadelphia, we manufacture ketchup, we feed people. Our mission is to delight people via food. And the technology, AI or what have you, is our tool to excel at our mission. Being able to learn how to leverage existing and future to get the right product at the right price at the right location is what we are all about. Laurel: That's fantastic. Thank you so much, Jorge.

Amid the proliferation of e-commerce and shifting demand within the consumer-packaged goods ( CPG ) sector , AI and machine learning ( ML ) have become helpful tools in enabling efficiency and better business outcomes . The journey toward successfully deployed machine learning operations ( MLOps ) starts with data , says global head of machine learning operations and platforms at Kraft Heinz Company , Jorge Balestra . Curating well-organized and accessible data means enterprises can leverage their data volumes to train and develop AI and machine learning models . A strong data strategy lays the foundation for these AI and machine learning tools to use data to detect supply chain disruptions , identify and address cost inefficiencies , and predict demand for products . `` Never forget that data is the fuel , and data , it takes effort , it is a journey , it never ends , because that 's what is really what I would call what differentiates a lot of successful efforts compared to unsuccessful ones , '' says Balestra . This is especially crucial but challenging within the CPG sector where data is often incomplete given the inconsistent methods for consumer habit tracking among different retailers . He explains , `` We do n't know exactly and we do n't even want to know exactly what people are doing in their daily lives . What we want is just to get enough of the data so we can provide the right product for our consumers . '' To deploy AI and machine learning tools at scale , the Heinz Kraft Company has turned to the flexibility of the cloud . Using the cloud can allow for much-needed data accessibility while mitigating compute power . `` The agility of the whole thing increases exponentially because what used to take months , now can be done in a matter of seconds via code . So , definitely , I see how all of this explosion around analytics , around AI , is possible , because of cloud really powering all of these initiatives that are popping up left , right , and center . '' says Balestra . While it may be challenging to predict future trends in a sector so prone to change , Balestra says that preparing for the road ahead means focusing on adaptability and agility . `` Our mission is to delight people via food . And the technology , AI or what have you , is our tool to excel at our mission . Being able to learn how to leverage existing and future [ technology ] to get the right product at the right price , at the right location is what we are all about . '' This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Infosys Topaz and Infosys Cobalt . Laurel Ruma : From MIT Technology Review , I 'm Laurel Ruma , and this is Business Lab , the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace . Our topic is machine learning in the food and beverage industry . AI offers opportunities for innovation for customers and operational efficiencies for employees , but having a data strategy in place to capture these benefits is crucial . Two words for you : global innovation . My guest is Jorge Balestra , global head of machine learning operations and platforms at Kraft Heinz Company . This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Infosys Topaz and Infosys Cobalt . Welcome , Jorge . Jorge Balestra : Thank you very much . Glad to be here . Laurel : Well , wonderful to have you . So people are likely familiar with Kraft Heinz since it is one of the world 's largest food and beverage companies . Could you talk to us about your role at Kraft Heinz and how machine learning can help consumers in the grocery aisle ? Jorge : Certainly . My role , I will call , has two major focuses in two areas . One of them is I lead the machine learning engineering operations of the company globally . And on the other hand , I provide all of the analytical platforms that the company is using also on a global basis . So in role number one in my machine learning engineering and operations , what my team does is we grab all of these models that our community of data scientists that are working globally are coming up with , and we grabbed them and we strengthened it . Our major mission here is the first thing we need to do is we need to make sure that we are applying engineering practices to make them production ready and they can scale , they can also run in a cost-effective manner , and from there we ensure that in my operations hat they are there when needed . So a lot of these models , because they become part of our day-to-day operations , they 're going to come with certain specific service level commitments that we need to make , so my team makes sure that we are delivering on those with the right expectations . And on my other hand , which is the analytical platforms , is that we do a lot of descriptive , predictive , and prescriptive work in terms of analytics . The descriptive portion where you 're talking about just the regular dashboarding , summarization piece around our data and where the data lives , all of those analytical platforms that the company is using are also something that I take care of . And with that , you would think that I have a very broad base of customers in the company both in terms of geographies where they are from some of our businesses in Asia , all the way to North America , but also across the organization from marketing to HR and everything in between . Going into your other question about how machine learning is helping our consumers in the grocery aisle , I 'll probably summarize that for a CPG it 's all about having the right product at the right price , at the right location for you . What that means is on the right product , their machine learning can help a lot of our marketing teams , for example , even when they are now with the latest generative AI capabilities are showing up like brainstorming and creating new content to R & D , what we 're trying to figure out what is the best formulas for our products , there 's definitely now ML is making inroads in that space , the right price , all about cost efficiencies throughout from our plans to our distribution centers , making sure that we are eliminating waste . Leveraging machine learning capabilities is something that we are doing across the board from our revenue management , which is the right price for people to buy our products . And then last but not least is the right location . So we need to make sure that when our consumers are going into their stores or are buying our products online that the product is there for you and you 're going to find the product you like , the flavor you like immediately . And so there is a huge effort around predicting our demand , organizing our supply chain , our distribution , scheduling our plans to make sure that we are producing the right quantities and delivering them to the right places so our consumers can find our products . Laurel : Well , that certainly makes sense since data does play such a crucial role in deploying advanced technologies , especially machine learning . So how does Kraft Heinz ensure the accessibility , quality and security of all of that data at the right place at the right time to drive effective machine learning operations or MLOps ? Are there specific best practices that you 've discovered ? Jorge : Well , the best practice that I can probably advise people on is definitely data is the fuel of machine learning . So without data , there is no modeling . And data , organizing your data , both the data that you have internally and externally takes time . Making sure that it 's not only accessible and you are organizing it in a way that you do n't have a gazillion technologies to deal with is important , but also I would say the curation of it . That is a long-term commitment . So I strongly advise anyone that is listening right now to understand that your data journey , as it is , is a journey , it does n't have an end destination , and also it 's going to take time . And the more you are successful in terms of getting all the data that you need organized and making sure that is available , the more successful you 're going to be leveraging all of that with models in machine learning and great things that are there to actually then accomplish a specific business outcome . So a good metaphor that I like to say is there 's a lot of researchers , and MIT is known for its research , but the researchers can not do anything without the librarians , with all the people that 's organizing the knowledge around so you can go and actually do what you need to do , which is in this case research . Never forget that data is the fuel , and data , it takes effort , it is a journey , it never ends , because that 's what is really what I would call what differentiates a lot of successful efforts compared to unsuccessful ones . Laurel : Getting back to that right place at the right time mentality , within the last few years , the consumer packaged goods , or you mentioned earlier , the CPG sector , has seen such major shifts from changing customer demands to the proliferation of e-commerce channels . So how can AI and machine learning tools help influence business outcomes or improve operational efficiency ? Jorge : I 've got two examples that I can say . One is , well , obviously we all want to forget about what happened during the pandemic , but for us it was a key , very challenging time , because out of nowhere all of our supply chains got disrupted , our consumers needed our products more than ever because there were more hunkered down at home . So one of the things that I tell you , at least for us , that was key was through our modeling , through the data that we 've had , we 've had some good early warning of certain disruptions in the supply chain and we were able to at least get ... Especially when the outbreak started , a couple of weeks in advance , we were moving product , we were taking early actions in terms of ensuring that we were delivering an increased amount of product that was needed . And that was because we had the data and we had some of those models that were alerting us about , `` Hey , something is wrong here , something is happening with our supply chain , you need to take action . '' And taking action at the right time , it 's key in terms of getting ahead of a lot of the things that can happen . And in our case , obviously we live in a competitive world , so taking actions before competition is important , that timing component . Another example I can give you and is more of something that is we 're doing more and more nowadays is this piece that I was referring to about the right location about product availability is key for CPG , and that is measured in something that is called the CFR , and is the customer field rate , which means is when someone is ordering product from Kraft Heinz that we are able to fulfill that order to 100 % , and we are expecting to be really high with high 90s in terms of how efficient we are filling those orders . We have developed new technology that I think we are pretty proud of because I think it is unique within CPG that allows us to really predict what is going to happen with CFR in the future based on the specific actions we 're taking today , whereas it 's changing our production lines , whereas changes in distribution , et cetera , we 're able to see not only the immediate effect , but what 's going to happen in the future with that CFR so we can really act on it and deliver actions right now that are in the benefit of our distribution in the future . So those are , I would call it , say , two examples in terms of how we 're leveraging AI and machine learning tools in our day-to-day operations . Laurel : Are those examples , the CFR as well as the supply chain and making sure consumers had everything on demand almost , is this unique to the food and beverage industry ? And what are perhaps some other unique challenges that the food and beverage industry faces when you 're implementing AI and machine learning innovations ? And how do you navigate challenges like that ? Jorge : Yeah , I think something that is very unique for us is that we always have to deal with an incomplete picture in terms of the data that we have in our consumers . So if you think about it , when you go into a grocery store , a couple of things , well , you are buying from that store , the Kroger 's , Walmart 's , et cetera , and some of those will have you identified in terms of what is your consumption patterns , some will not . But also , in our case , if you are going to go buy a Philadelphia [ cream cheese ] , for example , you may choose to buy your Philadelphia in multiple outlets .

And I 'm going back to Philadelphia because , by the way , that 's my favorite Kraft product ever ... Laurel : Philadelphia cream cheese , right ? Jorge : Yes , absolutely . It 's followed by a close second with our ketchup . I have a soft spot for Philadelphia , pun intended . Laurel : – and the ketchup . Jorge : Exactly . No , but you have different presentations . You have the spreadable , you have the brick of cream cheese , within the brick you have some flavors , and what we want to do is make sure that we are providing the flavors that people really want , not producing the ones that people do n't want , because that 's just waste , without knowing specifically who is buying on the other side and you want to buy it in a supermarket , one or two , or sometimes you are shifting .

Why Big Tech’s watermarking plans are some welcome good news,https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/02/13/1088103/why-big-techs-watermarking-plans-are-some-welcome-good-news/,2024-02-13,"<p>Big Tech is throwing its weight behind a standard that could add a “nutrition label” to images, video, and audio.</p>
","This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here. This week I am happy to bring you some encouraging news from the world of AI. Following the depressing Taylor Swift deepfake porn scandal and the proliferation of political deepfakes, such as AI-generated robocalls of President Biden asking voters to stay home, tech companies are stepping up and putting into place measures to better detect AI-generated content.  On February 6, Meta said it was going to label AI-generated images on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. When someone uses Meta’s AI tools to create images, the company will add visible markers to the image, as well as invisible watermarks and metadata in the image file. The company says its standards are in line with best practices laid out by the Partnership on AI, an AI research nonprofit. Big Tech is also throwing its weight behind a promising technical standard that could add a “nutrition label” to images, video, and audio. Called C2PA, it’s an open-source internet protocol that relies on cryptography to encode details about the origins of a piece of content, or what technologists refer to as “provenance” information. The developers of C2PA often compare the protocol to a nutrition label, but one that says where content came from and who—or what—created it. Read more about it here.  On February 8, Google announced it is joining other tech giants such as Microsoft and Adobe in the steering committee of C2PA and will include its watermark SynthID in all AI-generated images in its new Gemini tools. Meta says it is also participating in C2PA. Having an industry-wide standard makes it easier for companies to detect AI-generated content, no matter which system it was created with. OpenAI too announced new content provenance measures last week. It says it will add watermarks to the metadata of images generated with ChatGPT and DALL-E 3, its image-making AI. OpenAI says it will now include a visible label in images to signal they have been created with AI.  These methods are a promising start, but they’re not foolproof. Watermarks in metadata are easy to circumvent by taking a screenshot of images and just using that, while visual labels can be cropped or edited out. There is perhaps more hope for invisible watermarks like Google’s SynthID, which subtly changes the pixels of an image so that computer programs can detect the watermark but the human eye cannot. These are harder to tamper with. What’s more, there aren’t reliable ways to label and detect AI-generated video, audio, or even text.  But there is still value in creating these provenance tools. As Henry Ajder, a generative-AI expert, told me a couple of weeks ago when I interviewed him about how to prevent deepfake porn, the point is to create a “perverse customer journey.” In other words, add barriers and friction to the deepfake pipeline in order to slow down the creation and sharing of harmful content as much as possible. A determined person will likely still be able to override these protections, but every little bit helps.  There are also many nontechnical fixes tech companies could introduce to prevent problems such as deepfake porn. Major cloud service providers and app stores, such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple could move to ban services that can be used to create nonconsensual deepfake nudes. And watermarks should be included in all AI-generated content across the board, even by smaller startups developing the technology. What gives me hope is that alongside these voluntary measures we’re starting to see binding regulations, such as the EU’s AI Act and the Digital Services Act, which require tech companies to disclose AI-generated content and take down harmful content faster. There’s also renewed interest among US lawmakers in passing some binding rules on deepfakes. And following AI-generated robocalls of President Biden telling voters not to vote, the US Federal Communications Commission announced last week that it was banning the use of AI in these calls.  In general I’m pretty skeptical about voluntary guidelines and rules, because there’s no real accountability mechanism and companies can choose to change these rules whenever they want. The tech sector has a really bad track record for regulating itself. In the cutthroat, growth-driven tech world, things like responsible AI are often the first to face cuts.  But despite that, these announcements are extremely welcome. They’re also much better than the status quo, which is next to nothing.  Google’s Gemini is now in everything. Here’s how you can try it out. In the biggest mass-market AI launch yet, Google is rolling out Gemini, its family of large language models, across almost all its products, from Android to the iOS Google app to Gmail to Docs and more. You can now get your hands on Gemini Ultra, the most powerful version of the model, for the first time.  Bard is dead; long live Gemini: Google is also sunsetting Bard, its ChatGPT rival. Bard, which has been powered by a version of Gemini since December, will now be known as Gemini too. By baking Gemini into its ubiquitous tools, Google is hoping to make up lost ground and even overtake its rival OpenAI. Read more from Will Douglas Heaven.  A chatbot helped more people access mental-health servicesAn AI chatbot from a startup called Limbic helped increase the number of patients referred for mental-health services through England’s National Health Service (particularly among members of underrepresented groups, who are less likely to seek help), new research has found. (MIT Technology Review)  This robot can tidy a room without any helpA new system called OK-Robot could train robots to pick up and move objects in settings they haven’t encountered before. It’s an approach that might be able to plug the gap between rapidly improving AI models and actual robot capabilities, because it doesn’t require any additional costly, complex training. (MIT Technology Review)  Inside OpenAI’s plan to make AI more “democratic”This feature looks at how computer scientists at OpenAI are trying to address the technical problem of how to align their AIs to human values. But a bigger question remains unanswered: Exactly whose values should AI reflect? And who should get to decide? (Time)  OpenAI’s Sam Altman wants trillions to build chips for AIThe CEO has often complained that the company does not have enough computing power to train and run its powerful AI models. Altman is reportedly talking with investors in the United Arab Emirates government to raise up to $7 trillion to boost the world’s chip-building capacity. (The Wall Street Journal)  A new app to “dignify” womenUgh. In contrast to apps that sexualize images of women, some 4Chan users are using generative AI to add clothes, erase their tattoos and piercings, and make them look more modest. How about … we just leave women alone. (404 Media)  ","This story originally appeared in The Algorithm , our weekly newsletter on AI . To get stories like this in your inbox first , sign up here .

Called C2PA , it ’ s an open-source internet protocol that relies on cryptography to encode details about the origins of a piece of content , or what technologists refer to as “ provenance ” information . The developers of C2PA often compare the protocol to a nutrition label , but one that says where content came from and who—or what—created it . Read more about it here . On February 8 , Google announced it is joining other tech giants such as Microsoft and Adobe in the steering committee of C2PA and will include its watermark SynthID in all AI-generated images in its new Gemini tools . Meta says it is also participating in C2PA . Having an industry-wide standard makes it easier for companies to detect AI-generated content , no matter which system it was created with . OpenAI too announced new content provenance measures last week . It says it will add watermarks to the metadata of images generated with ChatGPT and DALL-E 3 , its image-making AI . OpenAI says it will now include a visible label in images to signal they have been created with AI . These methods are a promising start , but they ’ re not foolproof . Watermarks in metadata are easy to circumvent by taking a screenshot of images and just using that , while visual labels can be cropped or edited out . There is perhaps more hope for invisible watermarks like Google ’ s SynthID , which subtly changes the pixels of an image so that computer programs can detect the watermark but the human eye can not . These are harder to tamper with . What ’ s more , there aren ’ t reliable ways to label and detect AI-generated video , audio , or even text . But there is still value in creating these provenance tools . As Henry Ajder , a generative-AI expert , told me a couple of weeks ago when I interviewed him about how to prevent deepfake porn , the point is to create a “ perverse customer journey. ” In other words , add barriers and friction to the deepfake pipeline in order to slow down the creation and sharing of harmful content as much as possible . A determined person will likely still be able to override these protections , but every little bit helps . There are also many nontechnical fixes tech companies could introduce to prevent problems such as deepfake porn . Major cloud service providers and app stores , such as Google , Amazon , Microsoft , and Apple could move to ban services that can be used to create nonconsensual deepfake nudes . And watermarks should be included in all AI-generated content across the board , even by smaller startups developing the technology . What gives me hope is that alongside these voluntary measures we ’ re starting to see binding regulations , such as the EU ’ s AI Act and the Digital Services Act , which require tech companies to disclose AI-generated content and take down harmful content faster . There ’ s also renewed interest among US lawmakers in passing some binding rules on deepfakes . And following AI-generated robocalls of President Biden telling voters not to vote , the US Federal Communications Commission announced last week that it was banning the use of AI in these calls . In general I ’ m pretty skeptical about voluntary guidelines and rules , because there ’ s no real accountability mechanism and companies can choose to change these rules whenever they want . The tech sector has a really bad track record for regulating itself . In the cutthroat , growth-driven tech world , things like responsible AI are often the first to face cuts . But despite that , these announcements are extremely welcome . They ’ re also much better than the status quo , which is next to nothing . Google ’ s Gemini is now in everything . Here ’ s how you can try it out . In the biggest mass-market AI launch yet , Google is rolling out Gemini , its family of large language models , across almost all its products , from Android to the iOS Google app to Gmail to Docs and more . You can now get your hands on Gemini Ultra , the most powerful version of the model , for the first time . Bard is dead ; long live Gemini : Google is also sunsetting Bard , its ChatGPT rival . Bard , which has been powered by a version of Gemini since December , will now be known as Gemini too . By baking Gemini into its ubiquitous tools , Google is hoping to make up lost ground and even overtake its rival OpenAI . Read more from Will Douglas Heaven .

Google’s Gemini is now in everything. Here’s how you can try it out.,https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/02/08/1087911/googles-gemini-is-now-in-everything-heres-how-you-can-try-it-out/,2024-02-08,"<p>Gmail, Docs, and more will now come with Gemini baked in. But Europeans will have to wait before they can download the app.</p>
","In the biggest mass-market AI launch yet, Google is rolling out Gemini, its family of large language models, across almost all its products, from Android to the iOS Google app to Gmail to Docs and more. You can also now get your hands on Gemini Ultra, the most powerful version of the model, for the first time.   With this launch, Google is sunsetting Bard, the company's answer to ChatGPT. Bard, which has been powered by a version of Gemini since December, will now be known as Gemini too.   ChatGPT, released by Microsoft-backed OpenAI just 14 months ago, changed people’s expectations of what computers could do. Google, which has been racing to catch up ever since, unveiled its Gemini family of models in December. They are multimodal large language models that can interact with you via voice, image, and text. Google claimed that its own benchmarking showed that Gemini could outperform OpenAI's multimodal model, GPT-4, on a range of standard tests. But the margins were slim.  By baking Gemini into its ubiquitous products, Google is hoping to make up lost ground. “Every launch is big, but this one is the biggest yet,” Sissie Hsiao, Google vice president and general manager of Google Assistant and Bard (now Gemini), said in a press conference yesterday. “We think this is one of the most profound ways that we’re going to advance our company’s mission.” But some will have to wait longer than others to play with Google’s new toys. The company has announced rollouts in the US and East Asia but said nothing about when the Android and iOS apps will come to the UK or the rest of Europe. This may be because the company is waiting for the EU’s new AI Act to be set in stone, says Dragoș Tudorache, a Romanian politician and member of the European Parliament, who was a key negotiator on the law. “We’re working with local regulators to make sure that we’re abiding by local regime requirements before we can expand,” Hsiao said. “Rest assured, we are absolutely working on it and I hope we’ll be able to announce expansion very, very soon.” How can you get it? Gemini Pro, Google’s middle-tier model that has been available via Bard since December, will continue to be available for free on the web at gemini.google.com (rather than bard.google.com). But now there is a mobile app as well.  If you have an Android device, you can either download the Gemini app or opt in to an upgrade in Google Assistant. This will let you call up Gemini in the same way that you use Google Assistant: by pressing the power button, swiping from the corner of the screen, or saying “Hey, Google!” iOS users can download the Google app, which will now include Gemini. Gemini will pop up as an overlay on your screen, where you can ask it questions or give it instructions about whatever’s on your phone at the time, such as summarizing an article or generating a caption for a photo.   It outmatches GPT-4 in almost all ways—but only by a little. Was the buzz worth it? Finally, Google is launching a paid-for service called Gemini Advanced. This comes bundled in a subscription costing $19.99 a month that the company is calling the Google One Premium AI Plan. It combines the perks of the existing Google One Premium Plan, such as 2TB of extra storage, with access to Google's most powerful model, Gemini Ultra, for the first time. This will compete with OpenAI’s paid-for service, ChatGPT Plus, which buys you access to the more powerful GPT-4 (rather than the default GPT-3.5) for $20 a month. At some point soon (Google didn't say exactly when) this subscription will also unlock Gemini across Google’s Workspace apps like Docs, Sheets, and Slides, where it works as a smart assistant similar to the GPT-4-powered Copilot that Microsoft is trialing in Office 365. When can you get it? The free Gemini app (powered by Gemini Pro) is available from today in English in the US. Starting next week, you’ll be able to access it across the Asia Pacific region in English and in Japanese and Korean. But there is no word on when the app will come to the UK, countries in the EU, or Switzerland. Gemini Advanced (the paid-for service that gives access to Gemini Ultra) is available in English in more than 150 countries, including the UK and EU (but not France). Google says it is analyzing local requirements and fine-tuning Gemini for cultural nuance in different countries. But the company promises that more languages and regions are coming. What can you do with it? Google says it has developed its Gemini products with the help of more than 100 testers and power users. At the press conference yesterday, Google execs outlined a handful of use cases, such as getting Gemini to help write a cover letter for a job application. “This can help you come across as more professional and increase your relevance to recruiters,” said Google’s vice president for product management, Kristina Behr. Or you could take a picture of your flat tire and ask Gemini how to fix it. A more elaborate example involved Gemini managing a snack rota for the parents of kids on a soccer team. Gemini would come up with a schedule for who should bring snacks and when, help you email other parents, and then field their replies. In future versions, Gemini will be able to draw on data in your Google Drive that could help manage carpooling around game schedules, Behr said.    But we should expect people to come up with a lot more uses themselves. “I’m really excited to see how people around the world are going to push the envelope on this AI,” Hsaio said. Is it safe? Google has been working hard to make sure its products are safe to use. But no amount of testing can anticipate all the ways that tech will get used and misused once it is released. In the last few months, Meta saw people use its image-making app to produce pictures of Mickey Mouse with guns and SpongeBob SquarePants flying a jet into two towers. Others used Microsoft’s image-making software to create fake pornographic images of Taylor Swift. The AI Act aims to mitigate some—but not all—of these problems. For example, it requires the makers of powerful AI like Gemini to build in safeguards, such as watermarking for generated images and steps to avoid reproducing copyrighted material. Google says that all images generated by its products will include its SynthID watermarks.  Like most companies, Google was knocked onto the back foot when ChatGPT arrived. Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI has given it a boost over its old rival. But with Gemini, Google has come back strong: this is the slickest packaging of this generation’s tech yet.  Correction: we made it clearer that you will need a subscription to access Gemini in Docs and Gmail.

Babies have an innate understanding of the physics of our world and can learn new concepts and languages quickly, even with limited information. Even the most powerful AI systems we have today lack those abilities. Language models that power systems like ChatGPT, for example, are great at predicting the next word in a sentence but don’t have anything even close to the common sense of a toddler.   But what if an AI could learn like a baby? AI models are trained on vast data sets consisting of billions of data points. Researchers at New York University wanted to see what such models could do when they were trained on a much smaller data set: the sights and sounds experienced by a single child learning to talk. To their surprise, their AI learned a lot—thanks to a curious baby called Sam.  The researchers strapped a camera on Sam’s head, and he wore it off and on for one and a half years, from the time he was six months old until a little after his second birthday. The material he collected allowed the researchers to teach a neural network to match words to the objects they represent, reports Cassandra Willyard in this story. (Worth clicking just for the incredibly cute pictures!)  This research is just one example of how babies could take us a step closer to teaching computers to learn like humans—and ultimately build AI systems that are as intelligent as we are. Babies have inspired researchers for years. They are keen observers and excellent learners. Babies also learn through trial and error, and humans keep getting smarter as we learn more about the world. Developmental psychologists say that babies have an intuitive sense of what will happen next. For example, they know that a ball exists even though it is hidden from view, that the ball is solid and won’t suddenly change form, and that it rolls away in a continuous path and can’t suddenly teleport elsewhere.  Researchers at Google DeepMind tried to teach an AI system to have that same sense of “intuitive physics” by training a model that learns how things move by focusing on objects in videos instead of individual pixels. They trained the model on hundreds of thousands of videos to learn how an object behaves. If babies are surprised by something like a ball suddenly flying out of the window, the theory goes, it is because the object is moving in a way that violates the baby’s understanding of physics. The researchers at Google DeepMind managed to get their AI system, too, to show “surprise” when an object moved differently from the way it had learned that objects move. Yann LeCun, a Turing Prize winner and Meta’s chief AI scientist, has argued that teaching AI systems to observe like children might be the way forward to more intelligent systems. He says humans have a simulation of the world, or a “world model,” in our brains, allowing us to know intuitively that the world is three-dimensional and that objects don’t actually disappear when they go out of view. It lets us predict where a bouncing ball or a speeding bike will be in a few seconds’ time. He’s busy building entirely new architectures for AI that take inspiration from how humans learn. We covered his big bet for the future of AI here. The AI systems of today excel at narrow tasks, such as playing chess or generating text that sounds like something written by a human. But compared with the human brain—the most powerful machine we know of—these systems are brittle. They lack the sort of common sense that would allow them to operate seamlessly in a messy world, do more sophisticated reasoning, and be more helpful to humans. Studying how babies learn could help us unlock those abilities.  This robot can tidy a room without any help Robots are good at certain tasks. They’re great at picking up and moving objects, for example, and they’re even getting better at cooking. But while robots may easily complete tasks like these in a laboratory, getting them to work in an unfamiliar environment where there’s little data available is a real challenge. Pick this up, please: Now, a new system called OK-Robot could train robots to pick up and move objects in settings they haven’t encountered before. It’s an approach that might be able to plug the gap between rapidly improving AI models and actual robot capabilities, since it doesn’t require any costly, complex additional training. Read more from Rhiannon Williams here.

A chatbot helped more people access mental-health services,https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/02/05/1087690/a-chatbot-helped-more-people-access-mental-health-services/,2024-02-05,"<p>The Limbic chatbot, which screens people seeking help for mental-health problems, led to a significant increase in referrals among minority communities in England.</p>
","An AI chatbot helped increase the number of patients referred for mental-health services through England’s National Health Service (NHS), particularly among underrepresented groups who are less likely to seek help, new research has found. Demand for mental-health services in England is on the rise, particularly since the covid-19 pandemic. Mental-health services received 4.6 million patient referrals in 2022—the highest number on record—and the number of people in contact with such services is growing steadily. But neither the funding nor the number of mental-health professionals is adequate to meet this rising demand, according to the British Medical Association.   The chatbot’s creators, from the AI company Limbic, set out to investigate whether AI could lower the barrier to care by helping patients access help more quickly and efficiently. A new study, published today in Nature Medicine, evaluated the effect that the chatbot, called Limbic Access, had on referrals to the NHS Talking Therapies for Anxiety and Depression program, a series of evidence-based psychological therapies for adults experiencing anxiety disorders, depression, or both.   It examined data from 129,400 people visiting websites to refer themselves to 28 different NHS Talking Therapies services across England, half of which used the chatbot on their website and half of which used other data-collecting methods such as web forms. The number of referrals from services using the Limbic chatbot rose by 15% during the study’s three-month time period, compared with a 6% rise in referrals for the services that weren’t using it.   Referrals among minority groups, including ethnic and sexual minorities, grew significantly when the chatbot was available—rising 179% among people who identified as nonbinary, 39% for Asian patients, and 40% for Black patients.  Crucially, the report’s authors said that the higher numbers of patients being referred for help from the services did not increase waiting times or cause a reduction in the number of clinical assessments being performed. That’s because the detailed information the chatbot collected reduced the amount of time human clinicians needed to spend assessing patients, while improving the quality of the assessments and freeing up other resources. Researchers are learning more about how therapy works by examining the language therapists use with clients. It could lead to more people getting better, and staying better. It’s worth bearing in mind that an interactive chatbot and a static web form are very different methods of gathering information, points out John Torous, director of the digital psychiatry division at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Massachusetts, who was not involved in the study. “In some ways, this is showing us where the field may be going—that it’ll be easier to reach people to screen them, regardless of the technology,” he says. “But it does beg the question of what type of services are we going to be offering people, and how do we allocate those services?” Overall, patients who’d used the chatbot and provided positive feedback to Limbic mentioned its ease and convenience. They also said that the referral made them feel more hopeful about getting better or helped them know they were not alone. Nonbinary respondents mentioned the non-human nature of the chatbot more frequently than patients who identified as male or female, which may suggest that interacting with the bot helped avoid feelings of judgment, stigma, or anxiety that can be triggered by speaking to a person. “Seeing proportionally greater improvements from individuals in minority communities across gender, sexual, and ethnic minorities, who are typically hard-to-reach individuals, was a really exciting finding,” says Ross Harper, Limbic’s founder and CEO, who coauthored the research. “It shows that in the right hands, AI can be a powerful tool for equity and inclusion.” Visitors to the chatbot-enabled websites were met with a pop-up explaining that Limbic is a robotic assistant designed to help them access psychological support. As part of an initial evidence-based screening process, the chatbot asks a series of questions, including whether the patient has any long-term medical conditions or former diagnoses from mental-health professionals. It follows these with multiple questions designed to measure symptoms of common mental-health issues and anxiety, tailoring its questioning to the symptoms most relevant to the patient’s problems. The chatbot uses the data it collects to create a detailed referral, which it shares with the electronic record system the service uses. A human care professional can then access that referral and contact the patient within a couple of days to make an assessment and start treatment. Limbic’s chatbot is a combination of different kinds of AI models. The first uses natural-language processing to analyze a patient’s typed responses and provide appropriate, empathetic answers. Probabilistic models take the data the patient has entered and use it to tailor the chatbot’s responses in line with the patient’s most likely mental-health problem. These models are capable of classifying eight common mental-health issues with 93% accuracy, the report’s authors said. “There aren’t enough mental-health professionals, so we want to use AI to amplify what we do have,” adds Harper. “That collaboration between human specialists and an AI specialist—that’s where we’ll really solve the supply-demand imbalance in mental health.” ","An AI chatbot helped increase the number of patients referred for mental-health services through England ’ s National Health Service ( NHS ) , particularly among underrepresented groups who are less likely to seek help , new research has found .

This robot can tidy a room without any help,https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/02/01/1087445/this-robot-can-tidy-a-room-without-any-help/,2024-02-01,"<p>A new system helps robots navigate homes they’ve never seen before with a little help from open-source AI models.</p>
","Robots are good at certain tasks. They’re great at picking up and moving objects, for example, and they’re even getting better at cooking.But while robots may easily complete tasks like these in a laboratory, getting them to work in an unfamiliar environment where there’s little data available is a real challenge. Now, a new system called OK-Robot could train robots to pick up and move objects in settings they haven’t encountered before. It’s an approach that might be able to plug the gap between rapidly improving AI models and actual robot capabilities, as it doesn’t require any additional costly, complex training. To develop the system, researchers from New York University and Meta tested Stretch, a commercially available robot made by Hello Robot that consists of a wheeled unit, a tall pole, and a retractable arm, in a total of 10 rooms in five homes.  While in a room with the robot, a researcher would scan their surroundings using Record3D, an iPhone app that uses the phone’s lidar system to take a 3D video to share with the robot.  The OK-Robot system then ran an open-source AI object detection model over the video’s frames. This, in combination with other open-source models, helped the robot identify objects in that room like a toy dragon, a tube of toothpaste, and a pack of playing cards, as well as locations around the room including a chair, a table, and a trash can. The team then instructed the robot to pick up a specific item and move it to a new location. The robot’s pincer arm did this successfully in 58.5% of cases; the success rate rose to 82% in rooms that were less cluttered. (Their research has not yet been peer reviewed.) The recent AI boom has led to enormous leaps in language and computer vision capabilities, allowing robotics researchers access to open-source AI models and tools that didn’t exist even three years ago, says Matthias Minderer, a senior computer vision research scientist at Google DeepMind, who was not involved in the project. “I would say it’s quite unusual to be completely reliant on off-the-shelf models, and that it’s quite impressive to make them work,” he says. The Dobb-E domestic robotics system was trained in real people’s homes and could help solve the field’s data problem. “We’ve seen a revolution in machine learning that has made it possible to create models that work not just in laboratories, but in the open world,” he adds. “Seeing that this actually works in a real physical environment is very useful information.” Because the researchers’ system used models that weren’t fine-tuned to this particular project, when the robot couldn’t find the object it was instructed to look for it simply stopped in its tracks instead of trying to work out a solution. That significant limitation is one reason the robot was more likely to succeed in tidier environments—fewer objects meant fewer chances for confusion, and a clearer space for navigation. Using ready-made open-source models was both a blessing and a curse, says Lerrel Pinto, an assistant professor of computer science at New York University, who co-led the project.  “On the positive side, you don’t have to give the robot any additional training data in the environment, it just works,” he says. “On the con side, it can only pick an object up and drop it somewhere else. You can’t ask it to open a drawer, because it only knows how to do those two things.”  Combining OK-Robot with voice recognition models could allow researchers to deliver instructions simply by speaking to the robot, making it easier for them to experiment with readily available datasets, says Mahi Shafiullah, a PhD student at New York University who co-led the research. “There is a very pervasive feeling in the [robotics] community that homes are difficult, robots are difficult, and combining homes and robots is just completely impossible,” he says. “I think once people start believing home robots are possible, a lot more work will start happening in this space.” ","Robots are good at certain tasks .

","This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here. Hi, Taylor. I can only imagine how you must be feeling after sexually explicit deepfake videos of you went viral on X. Disgusted. Distressed, perhaps. Humiliated, even.  I’m really sorry this is happening to you. Nobody deserves to have their image exploited like that. But if you aren’t already, I’m asking you to be furious.  Furious that this is happening to you and so many other women and marginalized people around the world. Furious that our current laws are woefully inept at protecting us from violations like this. Furious that men (because let’s face it, it’s mostly men doing this) can violate us in such an intimate way and walk away unscathed and unidentified. Furious that the companies that enable this material to be created and shared widely face no consequences either, and can profit off such a horrendous use of their technology.  Deepfake porn has been around for years, but its latest incarnation is its worst one yet. Generative AI has made it ridiculously easy and cheap to create realistic deepfakes. And nearly all deepfakes are made for porn. Only one image plucked off social media is enough to generate something passable. Anyone who has ever posted or had a photo published of them online is a sitting duck.  First, the bad news. At the moment, we have no good ways to fight this. I just published a story looking at three ways we can combat nonconsensual deepfake porn, which include watermarks and data-poisoning tools. But the reality is that there is no neat technical fix for this problem. The fixes we do have are still experimental and haven’t been adopted widely by the tech sector, which limits their power.  The tech sector has thus far been unwilling or unmotivated to make changes that would prevent such material from being created with their tools or shared on their platforms. That is why we need regulation.  People with power, like yourself, can fight with money and lawyers. But low-income women, women of color, women fleeing abusive partners, women journalists, and even children are all seeing their likeness stolen and pornified, with no way to seek justice or support. Any one of your fans could be hurt by this development.  The good news is that the fact that this happened to you means politicians in the US are listening. You have a rare opportunity, and momentum, to push through real, actionable change.  I know you fight for what is right and aren’t afraid to speak up when you see injustice. There will be intense lobbying against any rules that would affect tech companies. But you have a platform and the power to convince lawmakers across the board that rules to combat these sorts of deepfakes are a necessity. Tech companies and politicians need to know that the days of dithering are over. The people creating these deepfakes need to be held accountable.  You once caused an actual earthquake. Winning the fight against nonconsensual deepfakes would have an even more earth-shaking impact. ","This story originally appeared in The Algorithm , our weekly newsletter on AI .

This puts the heat squarely on companies to accelerate their sustainability efforts. “It’s quite clear that the sense of urgency is increasing,” says Jonas Bohlin, chief product officer for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) platform provider Position Green. That pressure is coming from all directions. New regulations, such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSDR) in the EU, require that companies publicly report on their sustainability efforts. Investors want to channel their money into green opportunities. Customers want to do business with environmentally responsible companies. And organizations’ reputations for sustainability are playing a bigger role in attracting and retaining employees. On top of all these external pressures, there is also a significant business case for sustainability efforts. When companies conduct climate risk audits, for example, they are confronted with escalating threats to business continuity from extreme weather events such as floods, wildfires, and hurricanes, which are occurring with increasing frequency and severity. Mitigating the risks associated with direct damage to facilities and assets, supply chain disruptions, and service outages very quickly becomes a high-priority issue of business resiliency and competitive advantage. A related concern is the impact of climate change on the availability of natural resources, such as water in drought-prone regions like the American Southwest. “The biggest misconception that people have is that sustainability is about carbon emissions,” says Pablo Orvananos, global sustainability consulting lead at Hitachi Digital Services. “That’s what we call carbon tunnel vision. Sustainability is much more than carbon. It’s a plethora of environmental issues and social issues, and companies need to focus on all of it.” Companies looking to act will find a great deal of complexity surrounding corporate sustainability efforts. Companies are responsible not only for their own emissions and fossil fuels usage (Scope 1), but also the sustainability efforts of their energy suppliers (Scope 2) and their supply chain partners (Scope 3). New regulations require organizations to look beyond just emissions. Companies must ask questions about a broad range of environmental and societal issues: Are supply chain partners sourcing raw materials in an environmentally conscious manner? Are they treating workers fairly? Sustainability can’t be siloed into one specific task, such as decarbonizing the data center. The only way to achieve sustainability is with a comprehensive, holistic approach, says Daniel Versace, an ESG research analyst at IDC. “A siloed approach to ESG is an approach that’s bound to fail,” he adds.

The worst technology failures of 2023,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/22/1085829/the-worst-technology-failures-of-2023/,2023-12-22,"<p>The Titan submersible, lab-grown chicken, and GM’s wayward Cruise robotaxis made our annual list of the worst in tech.</p>
","Welcome to our annual list of the worst technologies. This year, one technology disaster in particular holds lessons for the rest of us: the Titan submersible that imploded while diving to see the Titanic.  Everyone had warned Stockton Rush, the sub’s creator, that it wasn’t safe. But he believed innovation meant tossing out the rule book and taking chances. He set aside good engineering in favor of wishful thinking. He and four others died.  To us it shows how the spirit of innovation can pull ahead of reality, sometimes with unpleasant consequences. It was a phenomenon we saw time and again this year, like when GM’s Cruise division put robotaxis into circulation before they were ready. Was the company in such a hurry because it’s been losing $2 billion a year? Others find convoluted ways to keep hopes alive, like a company that is showing off its industrial equipment but is quietly still using bespoke methods to craft its lab-grown meat. The worst cringe, though, is when true believers can’t see the looming disaster, but we do. That’s the case for the new “Ai Pin,” developed at a cost of tens of millions, that’s meant to replace smartphones. It looks like a titanic failure to us.  This summer we were glued to our news feeds as drama unfolded 3,500 meters below the ocean’s surface. An experimental submarine with five people aboard was lost after descending to see the wreck of the Titanic.   The Titan was a radical design for a deep-sea submersible: a minivan-size carbon fiber tube, operated with a joystick, that aerospace engineer Stockton Rush believed would open the depths to a new kind of tourism. His company, OceanGate, had been warned the vessel hadn’t been proved to withstand 400 atmospheres of pressure. His answer? “I think it was General MacArthur who said ‘You’re remembered for the rules you break,” Rush told a YouTuber. But breaking the rules of physics doesn’t work. On June 22, four days after contact was lost with the Titan, a deep-sea robot spotted the sub’s remains. It was most likely destroyed in a catastrophic implosion. In addition to Rush, the following passengers perished: More: The Titan Submersible Was “an Accident Waiting to Happen” (The New Yorker), OceanGate Was Warned of Potential for “Catastrophic” Problems With Titanic Mission (New York Times), OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush said in 2021 he knew he’d “broken some rules” (Business Insider) Instead of killing animals for food, why not manufacture beef or chicken in a laboratory vat? That’s the humane idea behind “lab-grown meat.” The problem, though, is making the stuff at a large scale. Take Upside Foods. The startup, based in Berkeley, California, had raised more than half a billion dollars and was showing off rows of big, gleaming steel bioreactors. Zero covid, a fraudulent crypto exchange, Elon Musk’s content moderation, and other technologies that went so, so, wrong. But journalists soon learned that Upside was a bird in borrowed feathers. Its big tanks weren’t producing its flagship ""whole textured chicken"" filets; to produce those it was growing chicken skin cells in much smaller laboratory flasks. Thin layers of cells were then being manually scooped up and pressed into chicken pieces. In other words, Upside was using lots of labor, plastic, and energy to make hardly any meat. Samir Qurashi, a former employee, told the Wall Street Journal he knows why Upside puffed up the potential of lab-grown food. “It’s the ‘fake it till you make it’ principle,” he said. And even though lab-grown chicken has FDA approval, there’s doubt whether lab meat will ever compete with the real thing. Chicken goes for $4.99 a pound at the supermarket. Upside still isn’t saying how much the lab version costs to make, but a few bites of it sell for $45 at a Michelin-starred restaurant in San Francisco. Upside has admitted the challenges. “We signed up for this work not because it’s easy, but because the world urgently needs it,” the company says.Update: Upside Foods responded to this story with the following statement from its CEO, Uma Valeti.“We are disappointed that this article fails to provide an accurate picture of the progress of cultivated meat and does not provide the right context for UPSIDE’s first product. UPSIDE has successfully and repeatedly demonstrated that we can scale our suspension technology to make delicious ground-textured and blended products. This platform is the basis for the commercial plant we are currently building, and will enable large scale production pending regulatory approval. UPSIDE is proud to have established a high-watermark with our whole textured chicken product that’s being served today. We will continue to be pioneers addressing the challenge of sustainably feeding a growing global population while minimizing environmental impact, and remain steadfast in our goal of bringing delicious and safe cultivated meat to consumers. While we know there will be many challenges ahead, UPSIDE chooses to work with optimism, grit and dogged determination towards our vision for a better future, buoyed by the progress we’ve already made and the urgency of the work ahead.” More: I tried lab-grown chicken at a Michelin-starred restaurant (MIT Technology Review), The Biggest Problem With Lab-Grown Chicken Is Growing the Chicken (Bloomberg), Insiders Reveal Major Problems at Lab-Grown-Meat Startup Upside Foods (Wired) Sorry, autopilot fans, but we can’t ignore the setbacks this year. Tesla just did a massive software recall after cars set on self-driving mode slammed into emergency vehicles. But the biggest reversal was at Cruise, the division of GM that became the first company to offer driverless taxi rides in San Francisco, day or night, with a fleet exceeding 400 cars. Cruise argues that robotaxis don’t get tired, don’t get drunk, and don’t get distracted. It even ran a full-page newspaper ad declaring that “humans are terrible drivers.” But Cruise forgot that to err is human—not what we want from robots. Soon, it was Cruise’s sensor-laden Chevy Bolts that started racking up noticeable mishaps, including dragging a pedestrian for 20 feet. This October, the California Department of Motor Vehicles suspended GM’s robotaxis, citing an “unreasonable risk to public safety.” It’s a blow for Cruise, which has since laid off 25% of its staff and saw its cofounder and CEO, Kyle Vogt, a onetime MIT student, resign from the company. “We have temporarily paused driverless service,” Cruise’s website now reads. It says it’s reviewing safety and taking steps to “regain public trust.”  More: GM’s Self-Driving Car Unit Skids Off Course (Wall Street Journal), Important Updates from Cruise (Getcruise.com) Plastic is great. It’s strong, it’s light, and it can be pressed into just about any shape: lawn chairs, bobbleheads, bags, tires, or thread. The problem is there’s too much of it, as Doug Main reported in MIT Technology Review this year. Humans make 430 million tons of plastic a year (significantly more than the weight of all people combined), but only 9% gets recycled. The rest ends up in landfills and, increasingly, in the environment. Not only does the average whale have kilograms of the stuff in its belly, but tiny bits of “microplastic” have been found in soft drinks, plankton, and human bloodstreams, and even floating in the air. The health effects of spreading microplastic pollution have barely been studied. Awareness of the planetary scourge is growing, and some are calling for a “plastics treaty” to help stop the pollution. It’s going to be a hard sell. That’s because plastic is so cheap and useful. Yet researchers say the best way to cut plastic waste is not to make it in the first place. More: Think your plastic is being recycled? Think again (MIT Technology Review),  Oh Good, Hurricanes Are Now Made of Microplastics (Wired)  The New York Times declared it Silicon Valley’s “Big, Bold Sci-Fi Bet” for what comes after the smartphone. The product? A plastic badge called the Ai Pin, with a camera, chips, and sensors. A device to wean us off our phone addiction is a worthy goal, but this blocky $699 pin (which also requires a $24-a-month subscription) isn’t it. An early review called the device, developed by startup Humane Ai, “equal parts magic and awkward.” Emphasis on the awkward. Users must speak voice commands to send messages or chat with an AI (a laser projector in the pin will also display information on your hand). It weighs as much as a golf ball, so you probably won’t be attaching it to a T-shirt.  It is the creation of a husband-and-wife team of former Apple executives, Bethany Bongiorno and Imran Chaudhri, who were led to their product idea with the guidance of a Buddhist monk named Brother Spirit, raising $240 million and filing 25 patents along the way, according to the Times. Clearly, there’s a lot of thought, money, and engineering involved in its creation. But as The Verge’s wearables reviewer Victoria Song points out, “it flouts the chief rule of good wearable design: you have to want to wear the damn thing.” As it is, the Ai Pin is neat, but it’s still no competition for the lure of a screen. More: Can A.I. and Lasers Cure Our Smartphone Addiction? (New York Times) Screens are good, actually (The Verge) A room-temperature superconductor is a material offering no electrical resistance. If it existed, it would make possible new types of batteries and powerful quantum computers, and bring nuclear fusion closer to reality. It’s a true Holy Grail. So when a report emerged this July from Korea that a substance called LK-99 was the real thing, attention seekers on the internet were ready to share. The news popped up first in Asia, along with an online video of a bit of material floating above a magnet. Then came the booster fuel of social media hot takes. “Today might have seen the biggest physics discovery of my lifetime,” said a post to X that has been viewed 30 million times. “I don’t think people fully grasp the implications … Here’s how it could totally change our lives.” No matter that the post had been written by a marketer at a coffee company. It was exciting—and hilarious—to see well-funded startups drop their work on rockets and biotech to try to make the magic substance. Kenneth Chang, a reporter at the New York Times, dubbed LK-99 “the Superconductor of the Summer.” But summer’s dreams soon ripped at the seams after real physicists couldn’t replicate the work. No, LK-99 is not a superconductor. Instead, impurities in the recipe could have misled the Korean researchers—and, thanks to social media, the rest of us too. More: LK-99 Is the Superconductor of the Summer (New York Times)  LK-99 isn’t a superconductor—how science sleuths solved the mystery (Nature) Solar geoengineering is the idea to cool the planet by releasing reflective materials into the atmosphere. It’s a fraught concept, because it won’t stop the greenhouse effect—only mask it. And who gets to decide to block the sun? Mexico banned geoengineering trials early this year after a startup called Make Sunsets decided it could commercialize the effort. Cofounder Luke Iseman decided to launch balloons in Mexico designed to disperse reflective sulfur dioxide into the sky. The startup is still selling “cooling credits” for $10 each on its website. Face filters, billionaires in space, and home-buying algorithms that overpay all made our annual list of technology gone wrong. Injecting particles into the sky is theoretically cheap and easy, and climate warming is a huge threat. But moving too fast can create a backlash that stalls progress, according to my colleague James Temple. “They’re violating the rights of communities to dictate their own future,” one critic said. Iseman remains unrepentant. “I don’t poll billions before taking a flight,” he has said. “I’m not going to ask for permission from every person in the world before I try to do a bit to cool Earth.”  More: The flawed logic of rushing out extreme climate solutions (MIT Technology Review), Mexico bans solar geoengineering experiments after startup’s field tests (The Verge), Researchers launched a solar geoengineering test flight in the UK last fall (MIT Technology Review) Update: This article stated that Upside Foods vats ""weren’t working."" It has been updated to clarify they weren’t producing its whole textured chicken product and to include a comment from the company. In addition, the original article stated that Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt was fired. Instead, he resigned. ","Welcome to our annual list of the worst technologies . This year , one technology disaster in particular holds lessons for the rest of us : the Titan submersible that imploded while diving to see the Titanic . Everyone had warned Stockton Rush , the sub ’ s creator , that it wasn ’ t safe . But he believed innovation meant tossing out the rule book and taking chances . He set aside good engineering in favor of wishful thinking . He and four others died . To us it shows how the spirit of innovation can pull ahead of reality , sometimes with unpleasant consequences . It was a phenomenon we saw time and again this year , like when GM ’ s Cruise division put robotaxis into circulation before they were ready . Was the company in such a hurry because it ’ s been losing $ 2 billion a year ? Others find convoluted ways to keep hopes alive , like a company that is showing off its industrial equipment but is quietly still using bespoke methods to craft its lab-grown meat . The worst cringe , though , is when true believers can ’ t see the looming disaster , but we do . That ’ s the case for the new “ Ai Pin , ” developed at a cost of tens of millions , that ’ s meant to replace smartphones . It looks like a titanic failure to us . This summer we were glued to our news feeds as drama unfolded 3,500 meters below the ocean ’ s surface . An experimental submarine with five people aboard was lost after descending to see the wreck of the Titanic . The Titan was a radical design for a deep-sea submersible : a minivan-size carbon fiber tube , operated with a joystick , that aerospace engineer Stockton Rush believed would open the depths to a new kind of tourism . His company , OceanGate , had been warned the vessel hadn ’ t been proved to withstand 400 atmospheres of pressure . His answer ? “ I think it was General MacArthur who said ‘ You ’ re remembered for the rules you break , ” Rush told a YouTuber . But breaking the rules of physics doesn ’ t work . On June 22 , four days after contact was lost with the Titan , a deep-sea robot spotted the sub ’ s remains . It was most likely destroyed in a catastrophic implosion . In addition to Rush , the following passengers perished : More : The Titan Submersible Was “ an Accident Waiting to Happen ” ( The New Yorker ) , OceanGate Was Warned of Potential for “ Catastrophic ” Problems With Titanic Mission ( New York Times ) , OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush said in 2021 he knew he ’ d “ broken some rules ” ( Business Insider ) Instead of killing animals for food , why not manufacture beef or chicken in a laboratory vat ?

","This story first appeared in China Report, MIT Technology Review’s newsletter about technology in China. Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Tuesday. Last month, MIT Technology Review unveiled our pick for 10 Breakthrough Technologies of 2024. These are the technological advancements that we believe will change our lives today or sometime in the future. Among them, there is one that specifically matters to the Chinese tech sector: chiplets. That’s what I wrote about in a new story today. Chiplets—the new chipmaking approach that breaks down chips into independent modules to reduce design costs and improve computing performance—can help China develop more powerful chips despite US government sanctions that prevent Chinese companies from importing certain key technologies. Outside China, chiplets are one of the alternative routes that the semiconductor industry could take to improve chip performance cost-effectively. Instead of endlessly trying to cram more transistors into one chip, the chiplet approach proposes that the functions of a chip can be separated into several smaller devices, and each component could be easier to make than a powerful single-piece chip. Companies like Apple and Intel have already made commercial products this way.  But within China, the technology takes on a different level of significance. US sanctions mean that Chinese companies can’t purchase the most advanced chips or the equipment to make them, so they have to figure out how to maximize the technologies they have. And chiplets come in handy here: if the companies can make each chiplet to the most advanced level they are capable of and assemble these chiplets into a system, it can act as a substitute for more powerful cutting-edge chips. The technology needed to make chiplet is not that new. Huawei, the Chinese tech giant that has a chip-design subsidiary called HiSilicon, experimented with its first chiplet design product in 2014. But the technology became more important to the company after it was subject to strict sanctions from the US in 2019 and couldn’t work with foreign factories anymore. In 2022, Huawei’s then chairman, Guo Ping, said the company was hoping to connect and stack up less advanced chip modules to keep the products competitive in the market.  Currently, there’s a lot of money going into the chiplet space. The Chinese government and investors have recognized the importance of chiplets, and they are pouring funding into academic projects and startups. Particularly, there’s one Chinese city that has gone all-in on chiplets, and you very likely have never heard its name: Wuxi (pronounced woo-she).  Halfway between Shanghai and Nanjing, Wuxi is a medium-sized city with a strong manufacturing industry. And it has a long history in the semiconductor sector: the Chinese government built a state-owned wafer factory there in the ’60s. And when the government decided to invest in the semiconductor industry by 1989, 75% of the state budget went into the factory in Wuxi. The war over advanced semiconductor technology continues, but China will likely take a more important role in manufacturing legacy chips for common devices. By 2022, Wuxi had over 600 chip companies and was behind only Shanghai and Beijing in terms of semiconductor industry competitiveness. Particularly, Wuxi is the center of chip packaging—the final steps in the assembly process, like integrating the silicon part with its plastic case and testing the chip’s performance. JCET, the third-largest chip packaging company in the world and the largest of its kind in China, was founded in Wuxi more than five decades ago. Their prominence in the packaging sector gives JCET and Wuxi an advantage in chiplets. Compared with traditional chips, chiplets are more accommodating of less-advanced manufacturing capabilities, but they require more sophisticated packaging techniques to ensure that different modules can work together seamlessly. So Wuxi’s established strength in packaging means it can be one step ahead of other cities in developing chiplets. In 2023, Wuxi announced its plan to become the “Chiplet Valley.” The city has pledged to spend $14 million to subsidize companies that develop chiplets in the region, and it has formed the Wuxi Institute of Interconnect Technology to focus research efforts on chiplets.  Wuxi is a great example of China’s hidden role in the global semiconductor industry: relative to sectors like chip design and manufacturing, packaging is labor intensive and not as desirable. That’s why there’s basically no packaging capability left in Western countries, and why places like Wuxi usually fly under everyone’s radar. But with the opportunity presented by chiplets, as well as other advancements in packaging techniques, there’s a chance for chip packaging to enter center stage again. And China is betting on that possibility heavily right now to leverage one of its few domestic strengths to get ahead in the semiconductor industry. Have you heard of Wuxi? Do you think it will play a more important role in the global semiconductor supply chain in the future? Let me know your thoughts at zeyi@technologyreview.com. 1.

Why China is betting big on chiplets,https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/02/06/1087804/china-betting-on-chiplets-packaging/,2024-02-06,"<p>By connecting several less-advanced chips into one, Chinese companies could circumvent the sanctions set by the US government.</p>
","For the past couple of years, US sanctions have had the Chinese semiconductor industry locked in a stranglehold. While Chinese companies can still manufacture chips for today’s uses, they are not allowed to import certain chipmaking technologies, making it almost impossible for them to produce more advanced products. There is a workaround, however. A relatively new technology known as chiplets is now offering China a way to circumvent these export bans, build a degree of self-reliance, and keep pace with other countries, particularly the US.  In the past year, both the Chinese government and venture capitalists have been focused on propping up the domestic chiplet industry. Academic researchers are being incentivized to solve the cutting-edge issues involved in chiplet manufacturing, while some chiplet startups, like Polar Bear Tech, have already produced their first products. In contrast to traditional chips, which integrate all components on a single piece of silicon, chiplets take a modular approach. Each chiplet has a dedicated function, like data processing or storage; they are then connected to become one system. Since each chiplet is smaller and more specialized, it’s cheaper to manufacture and less likely to malfunction. At the same time, individual chiplets in a system can be swapped out for newer, better versions to improve performance, while other functional components stay the same. Chipmakers are betting that smaller, more specialized chips can extend the life of Moore’s Law. Because of their potential to support continued growth in the post–Moore’s Law era, MIT Technology Review chose chiplets as one of the 10 Breakthrough Technologies of 2024. Powerful companies in the chip sector, like AMD, Intel, and Apple, have already used the technology in their products.  For those companies, chiplets are one of several ways that the semiconductor industry could keep increasing the computing power of chips despite their physical limits. But for Chinese chip companies, they could reduce the time and costs needed to develop more powerful chips domestically and supply growing, vital technology sectors like AI. And to turn that potential into reality, these companies need to invest in the chip-packaging technologies that connect chiplets into one device. “Developing the kinds of advanced packaging technologies required to leverage chiplet design is undoubtedly on China’s to-do list,” says Cameron McKnight-MacNeil, a process analyst at the semiconductor intelligence firm TechInsights. “China is known to have some of the fundamental underlying technologies for chiplet deployment.” The US government has used export blacklists to restrict China’s semiconductor industry development for several years. One such sanction, imposed in October 2022, banned selling to China any technology that can be used to build 14-nanometer-generation chips (a relatively advanced but not cutting-edge class) as well as more advanced ones. For years, the Chinese government has looked for ways to overcome the resulting bottleneck in chipmaking, but breakthroughs in areas like lithography—the process of using light to transfer a design pattern onto the silicon base material—could take decades to pull off. Today, China still lags in chip-manufacturing capability relative to companies in Taiwan, the Netherlands, and elsewhere. “Although we’ve now seen [China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation] produce seven-nanometer chips, we suspect that production is expensive and low yield,” says McKnight-MacNeil. Chiplet technology, however, promises a way to get around the restriction. By separating the functions of a chip into multiple chiplet modules, it reduces the difficulty of making each individual part. If China can’t buy or make a single piece of a powerful chip, it could connect some less-advanced chiplets that it does have the ability to make. Together, they could potentially achieve a similar level of computing power to the chips that the US is blocking China from accessing, if not more. But this approach to chipmaking poses a bigger challenge for another sector of the semiconductor industry: packaging, which is the process that assembles multiple components of a chip and tests the finished device’s performance. Making sure multiple chiplets can work together requires more sophisticated packaging techniques than those involved in a traditional single-piece chip. The technology used in this process is called advanced packaging.  This is an easier lift for China. Today, Chinese companies are already responsible for 38% of the chip packaging worldwide. Companies in Taiwan and Singapore still control the more advanced technologies, but it’s less difficult to catch up on this front. “Packaging is less standardized, somewhat less automated. It relies a lot more on skilled technicians,” says Harish Krishnaswamy, a professor at Columbia University who studies telecommunications and chip design. And since labor cost is still significantly cheaper in China than in the West, “I don’t think it’ll take decades [for China to catch up],” he says.  Like anything else in the semiconductor industry, developing chiplets costs money. But pushed by a sense of urgency to develop the domestic chip industry rapidly, the Chinese government and other investors have already started investing in chiplet researchers and startups. In July 2023, the National Nature Science Foundation of China, the top state fund for fundamental research, announced its plan to fund 17 to 30 chiplet research projects involving design, manufacturing, packaging, and more. It plans to give out $4 million to $6.5 million of research funding in the next four years, the organization says, and the goal is to increase chip performance by “one to two magnitudes.” This fund is more focused on academic research, but some local governments are also ready to invest in industrial opportunities in chiplets. Wuxi, a medium-sized city in eastern China, is positioning itself to be the hub of chiplet production—a “Chiplet Valley.” Last year, Wuxi’s government officials proposed establishing a $14 million fund to bring chiplet companies to the city, and it has already attracted a handful of domestic companies. At the same time, a slew of Chinese startups that positioned themselves to work in the chiplet field have received venture backing.  Polar Bear Tech, a Chinese startup developing universal and specialized chiplets, received over $14 million in investment in 2023. It released its first chiplet-based AI chip, the “Qiming 930,” in February 2023. Several other startups, like Chiplego, Calculet, and Kiwimoore, have also received millions of dollars to make specialized chiplets for cars or multimodal artificial-intelligence models.  There are trade-offs in opting for a chiplet approach. While it often lowers costs and improves customizability, having multiple components in a chip means more connections are needed. If one of them goes wrong, the whole chip can fail, so a high level of compatibility between modules is crucial. Connecting or stacking several chiplets also means that the system consumes more power and may heat up faster. That could undermine performance or even damage the chip itself.  To avoid those problems, different companies designing chiplets must adhere to the same protocols and technical standards. Globally, major companies came together in 2022 to propose Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe), an open standard on how to connect chiplets.  But all players want more influence for themselves, so some Chinese entities have come up with their own chiplet standards. In fact, different research alliances have proposed at least two Chinese chiplet standards as alternatives to UCIe in 2023, and a third standard that came out in January 2024 zoomed in on data transmission instead of physical connections. The first lithography tools were fairly simple, but the technologies that produce today’s chips are among humankind’s most complex inventions. Without a universal standard recognized by everyone in the industry, chiplets won’t be able to achieve the level of customizability that the technology promises. And their downsides could make companies around the world go back to traditional one-piece chips. For China, embracing chiplet technology won’t be enough to solve other problems, like the difficulty of obtaining or making lithography machines. Combining several less-advanced chips might give a performance boost to China’s chip technologies and stand in for the advanced ones that it can’t access, but it won’t be able to produce a chip that’s far ahead of existing top-line products. And as the US government constantly updates and expands its semiconductor sanctions, the chiplet technologies could become subject to restrictions too. In October 2023, when the US Commerce Department amended its earlier sanction on the Chinese semiconductor industry, it included some new language and a few mentions of chiplets. The amendment added new parameters determining what technology is banned from being sold to China, and some of those additions seem tailored to measuring how advanced chiplets are.  While chip factories around the world are not restricted from producing less-advanced chips for China, the Commerce Department’s document also asked them to assess whether these products could become a part of a more powerful integrated chip, putting more pressure on them to verify that their products don’t end up being a component in something that they would have been banned from exporting to China. With all the practical and political obstacles, the development of chiplets will still take some time, no matter how much political will and investment is poured into the sector.  It may be a shortcut for the Chinese semiconductor industry to make stronger chips, but it won’t be the magic solution to the US-China technology war.Correction: The story has been updated to clarify the classification of 14-nanometer chips. ","For the past couple of years , US sanctions have had the Chinese semiconductor industry locked in a stranglehold . While Chinese companies can still manufacture chips for today ’ s uses , they are not allowed to import certain chipmaking technologies , making it almost impossible for them to produce more advanced products . There is a workaround , however . A relatively new technology known as chiplets is now offering China a way to circumvent these export bans , build a degree of self-reliance , and keep pace with other countries , particularly the US . In the past year , both the Chinese government and venture capitalists have been focused on propping up the domestic chiplet industry . Academic researchers are being incentivized to solve the cutting-edge issues involved in chiplet manufacturing , while some chiplet startups , like Polar Bear Tech , have already produced their first products . In contrast to traditional chips , which integrate all components on a single piece of silicon , chiplets take a modular approach . Each chiplet has a dedicated function , like data processing or storage ; they are then connected to become one system . Since each chiplet is smaller and more specialized , it ’ s cheaper to manufacture and less likely to malfunction . At the same time , individual chiplets in a system can be swapped out for newer , better versions to improve performance , while other functional components stay the same . Chipmakers are betting that smaller , more specialized chips can extend the life of Moore ’ s Law . Because of their potential to support continued growth in the post–Moore ’ s Law era , MIT Technology Review chose chiplets as one of the 10 Breakthrough Technologies of 2024 . Powerful companies in the chip sector , like AMD , Intel , and Apple , have already used the technology in their products . For those companies , chiplets are one of several ways that the semiconductor industry could keep increasing the computing power of chips despite their physical limits . But for Chinese chip companies , they could reduce the time and costs needed to develop more powerful chips domestically and supply growing , vital technology sectors like AI . And to turn that potential into reality , these companies need to invest in the chip-packaging technologies that connect chiplets into one device . “ Developing the kinds of advanced packaging technologies required to leverage chiplet design is undoubtedly on China ’ s to-do list , ” says Cameron McKnight-MacNeil , a process analyst at the semiconductor intelligence firm TechInsights . “ China is known to have some of the fundamental underlying technologies for chiplet deployment. ” The US government has used export blacklists to restrict China ’ s semiconductor industry development for several years . One such sanction , imposed in October 2022 , banned selling to China any technology that can be used to build 14-nanometer-generation chips ( a relatively advanced but not cutting-edge class ) as well as more advanced ones . For years , the Chinese government has looked for ways to overcome the resulting bottleneck in chipmaking , but breakthroughs in areas like lithography—the process of using light to transfer a design pattern onto the silicon base material—could take decades to pull off . Today , China still lags in chip-manufacturing capability relative to companies in Taiwan , the Netherlands , and elsewhere . “ Although we ’ ve now seen [ China ’ s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation ] produce seven-nanometer chips , we suspect that production is expensive and low yield , ” says McKnight-MacNeil . Chiplet technology , however , promises a way to get around the restriction . By separating the functions of a chip into multiple chiplet modules , it reduces the difficulty of making each individual part . If China can ’ t buy or make a single piece of a powerful chip , it could connect some less-advanced chiplets that it does have the ability to make . Together , they could potentially achieve a similar level of computing power to the chips that the US is blocking China from accessing , if not more . But this approach to chipmaking poses a bigger challenge for another sector of the semiconductor industry : packaging , which is the process that assembles multiple components of a chip and tests the finished device ’ s performance . Making sure multiple chiplets can work together requires more sophisticated packaging techniques than those involved in a traditional single-piece chip . The technology used in this process is called advanced packaging . This is an easier lift for China . Today , Chinese companies are already responsible for 38 % of the chip packaging worldwide . Companies in Taiwan and Singapore still control the more advanced technologies , but it ’ s less difficult to catch up on this front . “ Packaging is less standardized , somewhat less automated . It relies a lot more on skilled technicians , ” says Harish Krishnaswamy , a professor at Columbia University who studies telecommunications and chip design . And since labor cost is still significantly cheaper in China than in the West , “ I don ’ t think it ’ ll take decades [ for China to catch up ] , ” he says . Like anything else in the semiconductor industry , developing chiplets costs money . But pushed by a sense of urgency to develop the domestic chip industry rapidly , the Chinese government and other investors have already started investing in chiplet researchers and startups . In July 2023 , the National Nature Science Foundation of China , the top state fund for fundamental research , announced its plan to fund 17 to 30 chiplet research projects involving design , manufacturing , packaging , and more . It plans to give out $ 4 million to $ 6.5 million of research funding in the next four years , the organization says , and the goal is to increase chip performance by “ one to two magnitudes. ” This fund is more focused on academic research , but some local governments are also ready to invest in industrial opportunities in chiplets . Wuxi , a medium-sized city in eastern China , is positioning itself to be the hub of chiplet production—a “ Chiplet Valley. ” Last year , Wuxi ’ s government officials proposed establishing a $ 14 million fund to bring chiplet companies to the city , and it has already attracted a handful of domestic companies . At the same time , a slew of Chinese startups that positioned themselves to work in the chiplet field have received venture backing . Polar Bear Tech , a Chinese startup developing universal and specialized chiplets , received over $ 14 million in investment in 2023 . It released its first chiplet-based AI chip , the “ Qiming 930 , ” in February 2023 . Several other startups , like Chiplego , Calculet , and Kiwimoore , have also received millions of dollars to make specialized chiplets for cars or multimodal artificial-intelligence models . There are trade-offs in opting for a chiplet approach . While it often lowers costs and improves customizability , having multiple components in a chip means more connections are needed . If one of them goes wrong , the whole chip can fail , so a high level of compatibility between modules is crucial . Connecting or stacking several chiplets also means that the system consumes more power and may heat up faster . That could undermine performance or even damage the chip itself . To avoid those problems , different companies designing chiplets must adhere to the same protocols and technical standards . Globally , major companies came together in 2022 to propose Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express ( UCIe ) , an open standard on how to connect chiplets . But all players want more influence for themselves , so some Chinese entities have come up with their own chiplet standards . In fact , different research alliances have proposed at least two Chinese chiplet standards as alternatives to UCIe in 2023 , and a third standard that came out in January 2024 zoomed in on data transmission instead of physical connections . The first lithography tools were fairly simple , but the technologies that produce today ’ s chips are among humankind ’ s most complex inventions .

Having the tools and technologies to enable forward-thinking and underpin digital transformation is key to survival. Supply chain procurement leaders are tasked with improving operational efficiencies and keeping an eye on the bottom line. For Raimundo Martinez, global digital solutions manager of procurement and supply chain at bp, the journey toward building a better supply chain starts with data. ""So, today, everybody talks about AI, ML, and all these tools,"" says Martinez. ""But to be honest with you, I think your journey really starts a little bit earlier. I think when we go out and think about this advanced technology, which obviously, have their place, I think in the beginning, what you really need to focus is in your foundational [layer], and that is your data."" In that vein, all of bp's data has been migrated to the cloud and its multiple procurement departments have been consolidated into a single global procurement organization. Having a centralized, single data source can reduce complexities and avoid data discrepancies. The biggest challenge to changes like data centralization and procurement reorganization is not technical, Martinez says, but human. Bringing another tool or new process into the fold can cause some to push back. Making sure that employees understand the value of these changes and the solutions they can offer is imperative for business leaders. Honesty toward both employees and end users—where an enterprise keeps track of its logistics, inventory, and processes—can be a costly investment. For a digital transformation journey of bp's scale, an investment in supply chain visibility is an investment in customer trust and business reputability. ""They feel part of it. They're more willing to give you feedback. They're also willing to give you a little bit more leeway. If you say that the tool is going to be, or some feature is going to be delayed a month, for example, but you don't give the reasons and they don't have that transparency and visibility into what is driving that delay, people just lose faith in your tool,"" says Martinez. Looking to the future, Martinez stresses the importance of a strong data foundation as a precursor to taking advantage of emerging technologies like AI and machine learning that can work to create a semi-autonomous supply chain. ""Moving a supply chain from a transactional item to a much more strategic item with the leverage of this technology, I think, that, to me, is the ultimate vision for the supply chain,"" says Martinez. This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Infosys Cobalt.  Laurel Ruma: From MIT Technology Review, I'm Laurel Ruma. And this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.Our topic is building a better supply chain. AI can bring efficiencies to many aspects of an enterprise, including supply chain. And where better to start than internal procurement processes. With better data, better decisions can be made quicker, both internally and by customers and partners. And that is better for everyone.Two words for you: automating transformation.My guest is Raimundo Martinez, who is the global digital solutions manager of procurement and supply chain at bp.This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Infosys Cobalt.Welcome, Raimundo. Raimundo Martinez: Hi, Laurel. Thanks for having me today. Laurel: So, let's start with providing some context to our conversation. bp has been on a digital transformation journey. What spurred it, and how is it going? Raimundo: I think there's many factors spurring digital transformation. But if I look at all of this, I think probably the key one is the rate of change in the world today and in the past. I think instead of slowing down, I think the rate of change is accelerating, and that makes business survivability the need to have quick access to the data to almost not live in today, but live in the future. And having tools and technologies that allow them to see what is coming up, what routes of action they can take, and then to enact those mitigation plans faster. And I think that's where the digital transformation is the key enabler of that. And I would say that's on the business side. I think the other one is the people mindset change, and that ties into how things are going. I think things are going pretty good. Technology wise, I've seen a large number of tools and technologies adopted. But I think probably the most important thing is this mindset and the workforce and the adoption of agile. This rate of change that we just talked in the first part can only probably be achieved in tame when the whole workforce has this agile mindset to react to it. Laurel: Well, supply chain procurement leaders are under pressure to improve operational efficiencies while keeping a careful eye on the bottom line. What is bp's procurement control tower, and how has it helped with bp's digital transformation? Raimundo: Yeah, sure. In a nutshell, think about old as myriad of systems of record where you have your data and users having to go to all of those. So, our control tower, what it does, is consolidate all the data in a single platform. And what we have done is not just present the data, but truly configured the data in form of alerts. And the idea is to tell our user, ""This is what's important. This are the three things that you really need to take care now."" And not stopping there, but then saying, ""Look, in order to take that action, we're giving you a summary information so you don't have to go to any other system to actually understand what is driving that alert."" But then on top of that, we're integrating that platform with this system's record so that request can complete it in seconds instead of in weeks. So, that in a nutshell, it's the control tower platform. And the way have helped... Again, we talk about tools and people. So, on the tool side, being able to demonstrate how this automation is done and the value of it and being able for other units to actually recycle the work that you have done, it accelerates and inspire other technical resources to take advantage of that. And then on the user side, one of the effects that have, again, this idea of the ability mindset, everything that we've done in the tool development is agile. So, bringing the users into that journey have actually helped us to also accelerate that aspect of our digital transformation. Laurel: On that topic of workplace agility. In 2020, bp began a reorganization that consolidated its procurement departments into that single global procurement organization. What were the challenges that resulted from this reorganization? Raimundo: Yeah. To give you a more context on that. So, if you think about bp being this really large global organizations divided in business units, before the organizations, every one of these business units have their own procurement departments, which handle literally billions of dollars that’s how big they were. And in that business, they have the ERP systems, your contract repository, your process and process deviation. But you only manage the portfolio to that. Once you integrate all of those organizations into a single one, now your responsibility become across some of those multiple business units, that has your data in all of these business systems. So, if you want to create a report, then it's really complicated because you have to not only go to these different systems, but the taxonomy of the data is different. So, an example, some business will call their territory, North America, the other one will call it east and west coast. So, if you want a report for a new business owner, it becomes really, really hard, and also the reports might not be as complete as they are. So, that really calls for some tools that we need to put in place to support that. And on top of that, the volume of requests now is so greater that just changing and adding steps to process aren't going to be enough. You really need to look into automation to satisfy this higher demand. Laurel: Well, speaking of automation, it can leverage existing technology and build efficiencies. So, what is the role of advanced technologies, like AI, machine learning and advanced analytics in the approach to your ongoing transformation? Raimundo: So, today, everybody talks about AI, ML, and all these tools. But to be honest with you, I think your journey really starts a little bit earlier. I think when we go out and think about this advanced technology, which obviously, have their place, I think in the beginning, what you really need to focus is in your foundational, and that is your data. So, you ask about the role of the cloud. So, for bp, what we have done is all of the data used to reside in multiple different sites out there. So, what we have done is all the data now has been migrated to the cloud. And then what the cloud also allows is to do transformations in place that help us really homogenize, what I just described before, North America, South America, then you can create another column and say, okay, now call it, whatever, United States, or however you want to call it. So, all of this data transformation happened in a single spot. And what that does is also allow our users that need this data to go to a single source of truth and not be pulling data from multiple systems. An example of the chaos that that creates is somebody will be pulling invoice and data from Spence, somebody will pull in PayData. So, then you already have data discrepancy on the reporting. And having a centralized tool where everybody goes for the data reduces so much complexity on the system. Laurel: And speaking about that kind of complexity, it's clear that multiple procurement systems made it difficult to maintain quality compliance as well, and as well as production tracking in bp supply chain. So, what are some of the most challenging aspects of realizing this new vision with a centralized one-stop platform? Raimundo: Yeah, we have a good list in there. So, let me break it into maybe technical and people, because I think people is something that we should talk about it. So, technical. I think one of the biggest things in technical is working with your technical team to find the right architecture. This is how your vision fits into our architecture, which will create less, let's say, confusion and complexity into your architecture. And the other side of the technical challenge is finding the right tools. I'll give you an example for our project. Initially, I thought, okay, RPA [robotic process automation] will be the technology to do this. So, we run a pilot RPA. And obviously, RPA has incredible applications out there. But at this point, RPA really wasn't the tool for us given the changes that could happen on the screens from the system that we're using. So, then we decided instead of going to RPA, going to API. So, that's an example of a challenge of finding exactly the right tool that you have. But to be honest with you, I think the biggest challenge is not technical, but human. Like I mentioned before, people are immersed in the sea of change that is going on, and here you come with yet another tool. So, even the tool you're giving them might be a lot more efficient, people still want to cling to what they know. So, if they say, ""Look, if I have to spend another two hours extracting data, putting Excel, collating and running a report..."" Some people may rather do that than go to a platform where all of that is done for them. So, I think change management is key in these transformations to make sure that they're able to sell or make people understand what the value of the tool is, and overcome that challenge, which is human normal aversion to change. And especially when you're immersed on this really, really sea of change that was already going as a result of the reorganization. Laurel: Yeah. People are hard, and tech can be easy. So, just to clarify, RPA is the robotic process automation in this context, correct? Raimundo: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Sorry about the pretty layered... Yeah. Laurel: No, no. There's lots of acronyms going around. So, inversely, we're just discussing the challenges, what are the positive outcomes from making this transformation? And could you give us an example or a use case of how that updated platform boosted efficiency across existing processes? Raimundo: Absolutely. Just quick generic. So, generic things is you find yourself a lot in this cycle of that data. The users look at the applications that said that data's not correct, and they lose the appetite for using that, but the problem is they own the data, but the process to change the data is so cumbersome that people don't really want to take ownership of that because they said, ""Look, I have 20 things to do. The least in my list is updating that data."" So, we're in this cycle of trying to put tools out for the user, the data is not correct, but we're not the ones who own the data. So, the specific example of how we broke that cycle is using automation. So, to give you an example, before we create automation, if you needed to change any contract data, you have to find what the contract is, then you have to go to a tool like Salesforce and create a case. That case goes to our global business support team, and then they have to read the case, open the system of record, make the change. And that could take between days or weeks. Meantime, the user is like, ""Well, I requested this thing, and it hasn't even happened."" So, what we did is leverage internal technology. We already had a large investment on Microsoft, as you can imagine. And we said, look, ""From Power BI, you can look at your contract, you can click on the record you want to change. Power App comes up and tells you what do you want to do."" Say, I want to change the contract owner, for example. It opens a window, says, ""Who's the new person you want to put in?"" And as soon as you submit it, literally, within less than a second, the API goes to the system of record, change the owner, creates an email that notifies everybody who is an stakeholder in that contract, which then increases visibility to changes across the organization. And at the same time, it leaves you an audit trail. So, if somebody wants to challenge that, you know exactly what happened. So, that has been an incredible outcome of reducing cycle time from days and weeks to merely seconds, at the same time, increasing communication and visibility into the data. That has been proved one of the greatest achievements that we have. Laurel: Well, I think you've really outlined this challenge. So, investing in supply chain visibility can be costly, but often bolsters trust and reputability among customers. What's the role of transparency and visibility in a digital transformation journey of this size? Raimundo: I keep talking about agile, and I think that's one of the tenets. And what I will add to transparent visibility, I would add actually honesty. I think it's very, very easy to learn from success. Everybody wants to tout the great things that they have done, but people may a little bit less inclined to speak out about their mistakes. I'll just give you an example of our situation with RPA. We don't feel bad about it. We feel that the more we share that knowledge with the technical teams, the much more value it has because then people will learn from that again and not commit the same mistake obviously. But I think also what honesty do in this visibility is when you bring your users into the development team, you have that visibility. They feel part of it. They're more willing to give you feedback. And also, they're also willing to give you a little bit more leeway. If you say that the tool is going to be, or some feature is going to be delayed a month, for example, but you don't give the reasons and they don't have that transparency and visibility into what is driving that delay, people just lose faith in your tool. Where I think the more open, the more visible you are, but also, again, with honesty, is you have a product that is so much more well received and that everybody feels part of the tool. It's something that in every training, at the end of the training, I just say, ""By the way, this is not my tool. This is your tool. And the more engaged you are with us, the much better outcome you're going to have."" And that's just achieved through transparency and visibility. Laurel: So, for other large organizations looking to create a centralized platform to improve supply chain visibility, what are some of the key best practices that you've found that leadership can adopt to achieve the smoothest transition? Raimundo: So, I probably think about three things. I think, one, the leadership needs to really, really do is understand the project. And when I say, understand the project, is really understanding the technical complexity, the human aspect of it, because I think that's where your leadership has a lot of role to play. They're able to influence their teams on this project that you're trying to... And then they really need to understand also what are the risks associated with this project. And also that these could be a very lengthy journey. Hopefully, obviously, there'll be results and milestones along, but they need to feel comfortable with also this agile mentality that we're going to do features, fail, adapt, and they really need to be part of that journey. The second biggest, I think, most important thing is having the right team. And in that, I think I've been super fortunate. We have a great partnership with Infosys. I've got one of the engineers named Sai. What the Infosys team and my technical team says is, ""Look, do not shortchange yourself on the ideas that you bring from the business side."" A lot of times, we might think about something as impossible. They really encourage me to come up with almost crazy ideas. Just come with everything that you can think about. And they're really, really incredible of delivering all the resources to bring in a solution to that. We almost end up using each other's phrases. So, having a team that is really passionate about change, about being honest, about working together is the key to delivery. And finally, data foundation. I think that we get so stuck looking at the shiny tools out there that seem like science fiction and they'll be great, and we forget that the outcome of those technologies are only as good as the data that we are supporting. And data, a lot of times, it seem as like the, I don't know, I don't want to call it ugly sister, the ugly person in the room. But it's really people... They're like, ""Oh, I don't want to deal with that. I just want to do AI."" Well, your AI is not going to give you what you want if it doesn't understand where you're at. So, data foundation is key. Having the perfect team and technology partners and understanding the project length, the risk and being really engaged will be, for me, the key items there. Laurel: That's certainly helpful. So, looking ahead, what technologies or trends do you foresee will enable greater efficiencies across supply chain and operations? Raimundo: It's not like a broken record, bet. I really think that technologies that look at our data and help us clean the data, foresee what items we're going to have with the data, how we can really have a data set that is really, really powerful, that is easy, and it has reflects exactly our situation, it's the key for then the next step, which is all of these amazing technologies. If I think about our vision, for the platform is to create a semi-autonomous supply chain. And the vision is imagine having, again, first, the right data, and now what you have is AI/ML and all these models that look at that internal data, compare that with external factors. And what it does is instead of presenting us alerts, we'll go to the next level, and it, basically, presents scenarios. And say, ""Look, based on the data that I see on the market, what you have had in your history, these are the three things that can happen, these are the plans that the tool recommends, and this is how you interact or affect that change."" So, moving a supply chain from a transactional item to a much more strategic item with the leverage of this technology, I think, that, to me, is the ultimate vision for supply chain.

Having the tools and technologies to enable forward-thinking and underpin digital transformation is key to survival . Supply chain procurement leaders are tasked with improving operational efficiencies and keeping an eye on the bottom line . For Raimundo Martinez , global digital solutions manager of procurement and supply chain at bp , the journey toward building a better supply chain starts with data . `` So , today , everybody talks about AI , ML , and all these tools , '' says Martinez . `` But to be honest with you , I think your journey really starts a little bit earlier . I think when we go out and think about this advanced technology , which obviously , have their place , I think in the beginning , what you really need to focus is in your foundational [ layer ] , and that is your data . '' In that vein , all of bp 's data has been migrated to the cloud and its multiple procurement departments have been consolidated into a single global procurement organization . Having a centralized , single data source can reduce complexities and avoid data discrepancies . The biggest challenge to changes like data centralization and procurement reorganization is not technical , Martinez says , but human . Bringing another tool or new process into the fold can cause some to push back . Making sure that employees understand the value of these changes and the solutions they can offer is imperative for business leaders . Honesty toward both employees and end users—where an enterprise keeps track of its logistics , inventory , and processes—can be a costly investment . For a digital transformation journey of bp 's scale , an investment in supply chain visibility is an investment in customer trust and business reputability . `` They feel part of it . They 're more willing to give you feedback . They 're also willing to give you a little bit more leeway . If you say that the tool is going to be , or some feature is going to be delayed a month , for example , but you do n't give the reasons and they do n't have that transparency and visibility into what is driving that delay , people just lose faith in your tool , '' says Martinez . Looking to the future , Martinez stresses the importance of a strong data foundation as a precursor to taking advantage of emerging technologies like AI and machine learning that can work to create a semi-autonomous supply chain . `` Moving a supply chain from a transactional item to a much more strategic item with the leverage of this technology , I think , that , to me , is the ultimate vision for the supply chain , '' says Martinez . This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Infosys Cobalt . Laurel Ruma : From MIT Technology Review , I 'm Laurel Ruma . And this is Business Lab , the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.Our topic is building a better supply chain . AI can bring efficiencies to many aspects of an enterprise , including supply chain . And where better to start than internal procurement processes . With better data , better decisions can be made quicker , both internally and by customers and partners . And that is better for everyone.Two words for you : automating transformation.My guest is Raimundo Martinez , who is the global digital solutions manager of procurement and supply chain at bp.This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Infosys Cobalt.Welcome , Raimundo . Raimundo Martinez : Hi , Laurel . Thanks for having me today . Laurel : So , let 's start with providing some context to our conversation . bp has been on a digital transformation journey . What spurred it , and how is it going ? Raimundo : I think there 's many factors spurring digital transformation . But if I look at all of this , I think probably the key one is the rate of change in the world today and in the past . I think instead of slowing down , I think the rate of change is accelerating , and that makes business survivability the need to have quick access to the data to almost not live in today , but live in the future . And having tools and technologies that allow them to see what is coming up , what routes of action they can take , and then to enact those mitigation plans faster . And I think that 's where the digital transformation is the key enabler of that . And I would say that 's on the business side . I think the other one is the people mindset change , and that ties into how things are going . I think things are going pretty good . Technology wise , I 've seen a large number of tools and technologies adopted . But I think probably the most important thing is this mindset and the workforce and the adoption of agile . This rate of change that we just talked in the first part can only probably be achieved in tame when the whole workforce has this agile mindset to react to it . Laurel : Well , supply chain procurement leaders are under pressure to improve operational efficiencies while keeping a careful eye on the bottom line . What is bp 's procurement control tower , and how has it helped with bp 's digital transformation ? Raimundo : Yeah , sure . In a nutshell , think about old as myriad of systems of record where you have your data and users having to go to all of those . So , our control tower , what it does , is consolidate all the data in a single platform . And what we have done is not just present the data , but truly configured the data in form of alerts . And the idea is to tell our user , `` This is what 's important . This are the three things that you really need to take care now . '' And not stopping there , but then saying , `` Look , in order to take that action , we 're giving you a summary information so you do n't have to go to any other system to actually understand what is driving that alert . '' But then on top of that , we 're integrating that platform with this system 's record so that request can complete it in seconds instead of in weeks . So , that in a nutshell , it 's the control tower platform . And the way have helped ... Again , we talk about tools and people . So , on the tool side , being able to demonstrate how this automation is done and the value of it and being able for other units to actually recycle the work that you have done , it accelerates and inspire other technical resources to take advantage of that . And then on the user side , one of the effects that have , again , this idea of the ability mindset , everything that we 've done in the tool development is agile . So , bringing the users into that journey have actually helped us to also accelerate that aspect of our digital transformation . Laurel : On that topic of workplace agility . In 2020 , bp began a reorganization that consolidated its procurement departments into that single global procurement organization . What were the challenges that resulted from this reorganization ? Raimundo : Yeah . To give you a more context on that . So , if you think about bp being this really large global organizations divided in business units , before the organizations , every one of these business units have their own procurement departments , which handle literally billions of dollars that ’ s how big they were . And in that business , they have the ERP systems , your contract repository , your process and process deviation . But you only manage the portfolio to that . Once you integrate all of those organizations into a single one , now your responsibility become across some of those multiple business units , that has your data in all of these business systems . So , if you want to create a report , then it 's really complicated because you have to not only go to these different systems , but the taxonomy of the data is different . So , an example , some business will call their territory , North America , the other one will call it east and west coast . So , if you want a report for a new business owner , it becomes really , really hard , and also the reports might not be as complete as they are . So , that really calls for some tools that we need to put in place to support that . And on top of that , the volume of requests now is so greater that just changing and adding steps to process are n't going to be enough . You really need to look into automation to satisfy this higher demand . Laurel : Well , speaking of automation , it can leverage existing technology and build efficiencies . So , what is the role of advanced technologies , like AI , machine learning and advanced analytics in the approach to your ongoing transformation ? Raimundo : So , today , everybody talks about AI , ML , and all these tools . But to be honest with you , I think your journey really starts a little bit earlier . I think when we go out and think about this advanced technology , which obviously , have their place , I think in the beginning , what you really need to focus is in your foundational , and that is your data . So , you ask about the role of the cloud . So , for bp , what we have done is all of the data used to reside in multiple different sites out there . So , what we have done is all the data now has been migrated to the cloud . And then what the cloud also allows is to do transformations in place that help us really homogenize , what I just described before , North America , South America , then you can create another column and say , okay , now call it , whatever , United States , or however you want to call it . So , all of this data transformation happened in a single spot . And what that does is also allow our users that need this data to go to a single source of truth and not be pulling data from multiple systems . An example of the chaos that that creates is somebody will be pulling invoice and data from Spence , somebody will pull in PayData . So , then you already have data discrepancy on the reporting . And having a centralized tool where everybody goes for the data reduces so much complexity on the system . Laurel : And speaking about that kind of complexity , it 's clear that multiple procurement systems made it difficult to maintain quality compliance as well , and as well as production tracking in bp supply chain . So , what are some of the most challenging aspects of realizing this new vision with a centralized one-stop platform ? Raimundo : Yeah , we have a good list in there . So , let me break it into maybe technical and people , because I think people is something that we should talk about it . So , technical . I think one of the biggest things in technical is working with your technical team to find the right architecture . This is how your vision fits into our architecture , which will create less , let 's say , confusion and complexity into your architecture . And the other side of the technical challenge is finding the right tools . I 'll give you an example for our project . Initially , I thought , okay , RPA [ robotic process automation ] will be the technology to do this . So , we run a pilot RPA . And obviously , RPA has incredible applications out there . But at this point , RPA really was n't the tool for us given the changes that could happen on the screens from the system that we 're using . So , then we decided instead of going to RPA , going to API . So , that 's an example of a challenge of finding exactly the right tool that you have . But to be honest with you , I think the biggest challenge is not technical , but human . Like I mentioned before , people are immersed in the sea of change that is going on , and here you come with yet another tool . So , even the tool you 're giving them might be a lot more efficient , people still want to cling to what they know . So , if they say , `` Look , if I have to spend another two hours extracting data , putting Excel , collating and running a report ... '' Some people may rather do that than go to a platform where all of that is done for them . So , I think change management is key in these transformations to make sure that they 're able to sell or make people understand what the value of the tool is , and overcome that challenge , which is human normal aversion to change . And especially when you 're immersed on this really , really sea of change that was already going as a result of the reorganization . Laurel : Yeah . People are hard , and tech can be easy . So , just to clarify , RPA is the robotic process automation in this context , correct ? Raimundo : Yeah , absolutely . Yeah . Sorry about the pretty layered ... Yeah . Laurel : No , no . There 's lots of acronyms going around . So , inversely , we 're just discussing the challenges , what are the positive outcomes from making this transformation ? And could you give us an example or a use case of how that updated platform boosted efficiency across existing processes ? Raimundo : Absolutely . Just quick generic . So , generic things is you find yourself a lot in this cycle of that data . The users look at the applications that said that data 's not correct , and they lose the appetite for using that , but the problem is they own the data , but the process to change the data is so cumbersome that people do n't really want to take ownership of that because they said , `` Look , I have 20 things to do . The least in my list is updating that data . '' So , we 're in this cycle of trying to put tools out for the user , the data is not correct , but we 're not the ones who own the data . So , the specific example of how we broke that cycle is using automation . So , to give you an example , before we create automation , if you needed to change any contract data , you have to find what the contract is , then you have to go to a tool like Salesforce and create a case . That case goes to our global business support team , and then they have to read the case , open the system of record , make the change . And that could take between days or weeks . Meantime , the user is like , `` Well , I requested this thing , and it has n't even happened . '' So , what we did is leverage internal technology . We already had a large investment on Microsoft , as you can imagine . And we said , look , `` From Power BI , you can look at your contract , you can click on the record you want to change . Power App comes up and tells you what do you want to do . '' Say , I want to change the contract owner , for example . It opens a window , says , `` Who 's the new person you want to put in ? '' And as soon as you submit it , literally , within less than a second , the API goes to the system of record , change the owner , creates an email that notifies everybody who is an stakeholder in that contract , which then increases visibility to changes across the organization . And at the same time , it leaves you an audit trail . So , if somebody wants to challenge that , you know exactly what happened . So , that has been an incredible outcome of reducing cycle time from days and weeks to merely seconds , at the same time , increasing communication and visibility into the data . That has been proved one of the greatest achievements that we have . Laurel : Well , I think you 've really outlined this challenge . So , investing in supply chain visibility can be costly , but often bolsters trust and reputability among customers . What 's the role of transparency and visibility in a digital transformation journey of this size ? Raimundo : I keep talking about agile , and I think that 's one of the tenets . And what I will add to transparent visibility , I would add actually honesty . I think it 's very , very easy to learn from success .

Chiplets: 10 Breakthrough Technologies 2024,https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/01/08/1085120/chiplets-moores-law-avanced-micro-devices-intel-chips-breakthrough-technologies/,2024-01-08,"<p>Chipmakers are betting that smaller, more specialized chips can extend the life of Moore’s Law.</p>
","Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express Now Packaging. It may sound boring, but it’s an essential part of building computer systems. Now companies are defining what that looks like for a new generation of machines.   For decades, chipmakers have improved performance by making transistors smaller and cramming more of them onto chips. The popular name for the trend is Moore’s Law. But that era is ending. It’s gotten immensely expensive to further shrink transistors and manufacture the complex chips that today’s high-tech industries demand.  In response, manufacturers are turning to smaller, more modular “chiplets” that are designed for specific functions (such as storing data or processing signals) and can be linked together to build a system. The smaller a chip, the fewer defects it’s likely to contain, making manufacturing less expensive. The US government aims to push microelectronics research forward. But maintaining competitiveness in the long term will require embracing uncertainty. Companies including Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have been marketing systems based on chiplets for years. But whether chiplets can help the industry maintain performance gains at the pace of Moore’s Law will depend on packaging, which entails placing them side by side or stacking them, forming fast, high-bandwidth electrical connections between them, and encasing them in protective plastic.  Manufacturers are still working out the best way to balance cost with performance. The $52.7 billion CHIPS Act, the 2022 US legislation aimed at shoring up the nation’s chip industry, directs $11 billion toward “advanced semiconductor” research and creates a National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program to foster collaboration between academia and industry.  So far, chiplet adoption has been hindered by the lack of technical standards for packaging. That’s changing: the industry has embraced an open-source standard called Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express. In theory, standards will make it easy to combine chiplets made by different companies, which could give chipmakers more freedom in fast-moving fields like AI, aerospace, and automaking. ","Advanced Micro Devices , Intel , Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express Now Packaging .

Exascale computers: 10 Breakthrough Technologies 2024,https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/01/08/1085128/exascale-computing-breakthrough-technologies/,2024-01-08,"<p>Computers capable of crunching a quintillion operations per second are expanding the limits of what scientists can simulate.</p>
","Oak Ridge National Lab, Jülich Super­computing Centre, China’s Supercomputing Center in Wuxi Now In May 2022, the global supercomputer rankings were shaken up by the launch of Frontier. Now the fastest supercomputer in the world, it can perform more than 1 quintillion (1018) floating-point operations per second. That’s a 1 followed by 18 zeros, also known as an exaflop. Essentially, Frontier can perform as many calculations in one second as 100,000 laptops. With the launch of Frontier, located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, the era of exascale computing officially began. Several more such exascale computers will soon join its ranks. In the US, researchers are installing two machines that will be about twice as fast as Frontier: El Capitan, at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, and Aurora, at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. Europe’s first exascale supercomputer, Jupiter, is expected to come online in late 2024. China reportedly also has exascale machines, although it has not released results from standard benchmark tests. Scientists have begun running experiments on Frontier, the world’s first official exascale machine, while facilities worldwide build other machines to join the ranks. Scientists and engineers are eager to use these turbocharged computers to advance a range of fields. Astrophysicists are already using Frontier to model the flow of gas in and out of the Milky Way; in addition to simulating motion on the scale of our galaxy, their model can zero in on exploding stars. This application showcases supercomputers’ unique ability to simulate physical objects at multiple scales simultaneously.  The progress won’t stop here. For the last three decades, supercomputers have gotten about 10 times faster every four years or so. And the stewards of these machines are already planning the next models: Oak Ridge engineers are designing a supercomputer that will be three to five times faster than Frontier, likely to be unveiled in the coming decade.  But one big challenge looms: the energy footprint. Frontier, which already employs energy-conserving innovations, draws enough power even while idling to run thousands of homes. Engineers will need to figure out how to build these behemoths not just for speed, but for environmental sustainability. ","Oak Ridge National Lab , Jülich Super­computing Centre , China ’ s Supercomputing Center in Wuxi Now In May 2022 , the global supercomputer rankings were shaken up by the launch of Frontier .

Apple Vision Pro: 10 Breakthrough Technologies 2024,https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/01/08/1085133/apple-vision-pro-micro-oled-mixed-reality-spatial-computer-virtual-reality-breakthrough-technologies/,2024-01-08,"<p>Micro-OLED technology has been in development for more than a decade, but the Vision Pro will be the highest-profile demonstration of its abilities to date.</p>
","Apple Later this year History is littered with doomed face computers. Google Glass, Microsoft HoloLens, and even Meta’s Quest line all failed to catch fire. Now, it’s Apple’s turn to try.  Later this year, Apple plans to start shipping its new Vision Pro, the company’s first mixed-reality headset. Its commercial success is very much an open question, but the Vision Pro is no doubt a breakthrough device, with a display radically better than any that has come before.  Apple revealed the headset (which it calls a spatial computer) in June at its annual developers’ event, pitching it as a better way to watch films, experience photos, connect with others, and even read and create.  Unlike virtual reality, mixed reality overlays digital content onto your real-world surroundings. Cameras and sensors embedded in the headset take what’s going on around you in a room and re-create it on a pair of screens—one for each eye. Then the headset adds in whatever digital content you’ve selected—a surfing video, for example, virtually projected right in front of your actual couch.  LEDs and their organic counterparts are getting truly tiny. This could be the moment AR and VR companies have been waiting for. The Vision Pro’s twin micro-OLED displays provide much higher resolution and sharper contrast than the liquid crystal displays found in most VR headsets—which means in addition to delivering mixed reality, the headset can also provide the most fully immersive experience we’ve ever seen.  One big remaining question: What will people use it for? Apple has a suite of apps at the ready, and developers can create their own, but will it mostly be a fancy video viewer? Another: Will people actually wear it?

Google Glass , Microsoft HoloLens , and even Meta ’ s Quest line all failed to catch fire . Now , it ’ s Apple ’ s turn to try . Later this year , Apple plans to start shipping its new Vision Pro , the company ’ s first mixed-reality headset . Its commercial success is very much an open question , but the Vision Pro is no doubt a breakthrough device , with a display radically better than any that has come before . Apple revealed the headset ( which it calls a spatial computer ) in June at its annual developers ’ event , pitching it as a better way to watch films , experience photos , connect with others , and even read and create . Unlike virtual reality , mixed reality overlays digital content onto your real-world surroundings . Cameras and sensors embedded in the headset take what ’ s going on around you in a room and re-create it on a pair of screens—one for each eye . Then the headset adds in whatever digital content you ’ ve selected—a surfing video , for example , virtually projected right in front of your actual couch . LEDs and their organic counterparts are getting truly tiny . This could be the moment AR and VR companies have been waiting for . The Vision Pro ’ s twin micro-OLED displays provide much higher resolution and sharper contrast than the liquid crystal displays found in most VR headsets—which means in addition to delivering mixed reality , the headset can also provide the most fully immersive experience we ’ ve ever seen . One big remaining question : What will people use it for ? Apple has a suite of apps at the ready , and developers can create their own , but will it mostly be a fancy video viewer ? Another : Will people actually wear it ? Apple added virtual eyes to the front to show where the wearer is looking , but at the June event it only shared videos of people wearing the headsets . How good or weird will those virtual eyes look in person ? And at $ 3,499 , the Vision Pro will cost thousands of dollars more than other headsets . That said , no other company has been as successful at developing and marketing consumer technology over the years .

Quantum computing is taking on its biggest challenge: noise,https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/01/04/1084783/quantum-computing-noise-google-ibm-microsoft/,2024-01-04,"<p>For a while researchers thought they’d have to make do with noisy, error-prone systems, at least in the near term. That’s starting to change.</p>
","In the past 20 years, hundreds of companies, including giants like Google, Microsoft, and IBM, have staked a claim in the rush to establish quantum computing. Investors have put in well over $5 billion so far. All this effort has just one purpose: creating the world’s next big thing.  Quantum computers use the counterintuitive rules that govern matter at the atomic and subatomic level to process information in ways that are impossible with conventional, or “classical,” computers. Experts suspect that this technology will be able to make an impact in fields as disparate as drug discovery, cryptography, finance, and supply-chain logistics.  The promise is certainly there, but so is the hype. In 2022, for instance, Haim Israel, managing director of research at Bank of America, declared that quantum computing will be “bigger than fire and bigger than all the revolutions that humanity has seen.” Even among scientists, a slew of claims and vicious counterclaims have made it a hard field to assess. Ultimately, though, assessing our progress in building useful quantum computers comes down to one central factor: whether we can handle the noise. The delicate nature of quantum systems makes them extremely vulnerable to the slightest disturbance, whether that’s a stray photon created by heat, a random signal from the surrounding electronics, or a physical vibration. This noise wreaks havoc, generating errors or even stopping a quantum computation in its tracks. It doesn’t matter how big your processor is, or what the killer applications might turn out to be: unless noise can be tamed, a quantum computer will never surpass what a classical computer can do.  For many years, researchers thought they might just have to make do with noisy circuitry, at least in the near term—and many hunted for applications that might do something useful with that limited capacity. The hunt hasn’t gone particularly well, but that may not matter now. In the last couple of years, theoretical and experimental breakthroughs have enabled researchers to declare that the problem of noise might finally be on the ropes. A combination of hardware and software strategies is showing promise for suppressing, mitigating, and cleaning up quantum errors. It’s not an especially elegant approach, but it does look as if it could work—and sooner than anyone expected. “I’m seeing much more evidence being presented in defense of optimism,” says Earl Campbell, vice president of quantum science at Riverlane, a quantum computing company based in Cambridge, UK.  Even the hard-line skeptics are being won over. University of Helsinki professor Sabrina Maniscalco, for example, researches the impact of noise on computations. A decade ago, she says, she was writing quantum computing off. “I thought there were really fundamental issues. I had no certainty that there would be a way out,” she says. Now, though, she is working on using quantum systems to design improved versions of light-activated cancer drugs that are effective at lower concentrations and can be activated by a less harmful form of light. She thinks the project is just two and a half years from success. For Maniscalco, the era of “quantum utility”—the point at which, for certain tasks, it makes sense to use a quantum rather than a classical processor—is almost upon us. “I’m actually quite confident about the fact that we will be entering the quantum utility era very soon,” she says.  This breakthrough moment comes after more than a decade of creeping disappointment. Throughout the late 2000s and the early 2010s, researchers building and running real-world quantum computers found them to be far more problematic than the theorists had hoped.  To some people, these problems seemed insurmountable. But others, like Jay Gambetta, were unfazed.  A quiet-spoken Australian, Gambetta has a PhD in physics from Griffith University, on Australia’s Gold Coast. He chose to go there in part because it allowed him to feed his surfing addiction. But in July 2004, he wrenched himself away and skipped off to the Northern Hemisphere to do research at Yale University on the quantum properties of light. Three years later (by which time he was an ex-surfer thanks to the chilly waters around New Haven), Gambetta moved even further north, to the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. Then he learned that IBM wanted to get a little more hands-on with quantum computing. In 2011, Gambetta became one of the company’s new hires.  IBM’s quantum engineers had been busy building quantum versions of the classical computer’s binary digit, or bit. In classical computers, the bit is an electronic switch, with two states to represent 0 and 1. In quantum computers, things are less black and white. If isolated from noise, a quantum bit, or “qubit,” can exist in a probabilistic combination of those two possible states, a bit like a coin in mid-toss. This property of qubits, along with their potential to be “entangled” with other qubits, is the key to the revolutionary possibilities of quantum computing. A year after joining the company, Gambetta spotted a problem with IBM’s qubits: everyone could see that they were getting pretty good. Whenever he met up with his fellow physicists at conferences, they would ask him to test out their latest ideas on IBM’s qubits. Within a couple of years, Gambetta had begun to balk at the volume of requests. “I started thinking that this was insane—why should we just run experiments for physicists?” he recalls.  “We watched the first jobs come in. We could see them pinging on the quantum computer. When it didn’t break, we started to relax.” It occurred to him that his life might be easier if he could find a way for physicists to operate IBM’s qubits for themselves—maybe via cloud computing. He mentioned it to his boss, and then he found himself with five minutes to pitch the idea to IBM’s executives at a gathering in late 2014. The only question they asked was whether Gambetta was sure he could pull it off. “I said yes,” he says. “I thought, how hard can it be?” Very hard, it turned out, because IBM’s executives told Gambetta he had to get it done quickly. “I wanted to spend two years doing it,” he says. They gave him a year. It was a daunting challenge: he barely knew what the cloud was back then. Fortunately, some of his colleagues did, and they were able to upgrade the team’s remote access protocols—useful for tweaking the machine in the evening or on the weekend—to create a suite of interfaces that could be accessed from anywhere in the world. The world’s first cloud-access quantum computer, built using five qubits, went live at midnight on May the 4th, 2016. The date, Star Wars Day, was chosen by nerds, for nerds. “I don’t think anyone in upper management was aware of that,” Gambetta says, laughing. Cryptographers want encryption schemes that are impossible for tomorrow’s quantum computers to crack. There’s only one catch: they might not exist. Not that upper management’s reaction to the launch date was uppermost in his mind. Of far more concern, he says, was whether a system reflecting years of behind-the-scenes development work would survive being hooked up to the real world. “We watched the first jobs come in. We could see them pinging on the quantum computer,” he says. “When it didn’t break, we started to relax.” Cloud-based quantum computing was an instant hit. Seven thousand people signed up in the first week, and there were 22,000 registered users by the end of the month. Their ventures made it clear, however, that quantum computing had a big problem. The field’s eventual aim is to have hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of qubits working together. But when it became possible for researchers to test out quantum computers with just a few qubits working together, many theory-based assumptions about how much noise they would generate turned out to be seriously off.  Some noise was always in the cards. Because they operate at temperatures above absolute zero, where thermal radiation is always present, everyone expected some random knocks to the qubits. But there were nonrandom knocks too. Changing temperatures in the control electronics created noise. Applying pulses of energy to put the qubits in the right states created noise. And worst of all, it turned out that sending a control signal to one qubit created noise in other, nearby qubits. “You’re manipulating a qubit and another one over there feels it,” says Michael Biercuk, director of the Quantum Control Laboratory at the University of Sydney in Australia.  By the time quantum algorithms were running on a dozen or so qubits, the performance was consistently shocking. In a 2022 assessment, Biercuk and others calculated the probability that an algorithm would run successfully before noise destroyed the information held in the qubits and forced the computation off track. If an algorithm with a known correct answer was run 30,000 times, say, the correct answer might be returned only three times. Though disappointing, it was also educational. “People learned a lot about these machines by actually using them,” Biercuk says. “We found a lot of stuff that more or less nobody knew about—or they knew and had no idea what to do about it.”  Once they had recovered from this noisy slap, researchers began to rally. And they have now come up with a set of solutions that can work together to bring the noise under control. Broadly speaking, solutions can be classed into three categories. The base layer is error suppression. This works through classical software and machine-learning algorithms, which continually analyze the behavior of the circuits and the qubits and then reconfigure the circuit design and the way instructions are given so that the information held in the qubits is better protected. This is one of the things that Biercuk’s company, Q-CTRL, works on; suppression, the company says, can make quantum algorithms 1,000 times more likely to produce a correct answer.  The next layer, error mitigation, uses the fact that not all errors cause a computation to fail; many of them will just steer the computation off track. By looking at the errors that noise creates in a particular system running a particular algorithm, researchers can apply a kind of “anti-noise” to the quantum circuit to reduce the chances of errors during the computation and in the output. This technique, something akin to the operation of noise-­canceling headphones, is not a perfect fix. It relies, for instance, on running the algorithm multiple times, which increases the cost of operation, and the algorithm only estimates the noise. Nonetheless, it does a decent job of reducing errors in the final output, Gambetta says.  Helsinki-based Algorithmiq, where Maniscalco is CEO, has its own way of cleaning up noise after the computation is done. “It basically eliminates the noise in post-­processing, like cleaning up the mess from the quantum computer,” Maniscalco says. So far, it seems to work at reasonably large scales.  On top of all that, there has been a growing roster of achievements in “quantum error correction,” or QEC. Instead of holding a qubit’s worth of information in one qubit, QEC encodes it in the quantum states of a set of qubits. A noise-induced error in any one of those is not as catastrophic as it would be if the information were held by a single qubit: by monitoring each of the additional qubits, it’s possible to detect any change and correct it before the information becomes unusable.  Implementing QEC has long been considered one of the essential steps on the path to large-scale, noise-tolerant quantum computing—to machines that can achieve all the promise of the technology, such as the ability to crack popular encryption schemes. The trouble is, QEC uses a lot of overhead. The gold-standard error correction architecture, known as a surface code, requires at least 13 physical qubits to protect a single useful “logical” qubit. As you connect logical qubits together, that number balloons: a useful processor might require 1,000 physical qubits for every logical qubit. There are now multiple reasons to be optimistic even about this, however. In July 2022, for instance, Google’s researchers published a demonstration of a surface code in action where performance got better—not worse—when more qubits were connected together.  That so many noise-handling techniques are flourishing is a huge deal—especially at a time when the notion that we might get something useful out of small-scale, noisy processors has turned out to be a bust. There have also been promising demonstrations of theoretical alternatives to surface codes. In August 2023, an IBM team that included Gambetta showed an error correction technique that could control the errors in a 12-qubit memory circuit using an extra 276 qubits, a big improvement over the thousands of extra qubits required by surface codes.  In September, two other teams demonstrated similar improvements with a fault-tolerant circuit called a CCZ gate, using superconducting circuitry and ion-trap processors. That so many noise-handling techniques are flourishing is a huge deal—especially at a time when the notion that we might get something useful out of small-scale, noisy processors has turned out to be a bust.  Actual error correction is not yet happening on commercially available quantum processors (and is not generally implementable as a real-time process during computations). But Biercuk sees quantum computing as finally hitting its stride. “I think we’re well on the way now,” he says. “I don’t see any fundamental issues at all.” And these innovations are happening alongside general improvements in hardware performance—meaning that there are ever fewer baseline errors in the functioning qubits—and an increase in the number of qubits on each processor, making bigger and more useful calculations possible. Biercuk says he is starting to see places where he might soon choose a quantum computer over the best-­performing classical machines. Neither a classical nor a quantum computer can fully solve large-scale tasks like finding the optimal routes for a nationwide fleet of delivery trucks. But, Biercuk points out, accessing and running the best classical supercomputers costs a great deal of money—potentially more than accessing and running a quantum computer that might even give a slightly better solution. “Look at what high-performance computing centers are doing on a daily basis,” says Kuan Tan, CTO and cofounder of the Finland-based quantum computer provider IQM. “They’re running power-hungry scientific calculations that are reachable [by] quantum computers that will consume much less power.” A quantum computer doesn’t have to be a better computer than any other kind of machine to attract paying customers, Tan says. It just has to be comparable in performance and cheaper to run. He expects we’ll achieve that quantum energy advantage in the next three to five years.  A debate has long raged about what target quantum computing researchers should be aiming for in their bid to compete with classical computers. Quantum supremacy, the goal Google has pursued—a demonstration that a quantum computer can solve a problem no classical computer can crack in a reasonable amount of time? Or quantum advantage—superior performance when it comes to a useful problem—as IBM has preferred? Or quantum utility, IBM’s newest buzzword? The semantics reflect differing views of what near-term objectives are important.  In June, IBM announced that it would begin retiring its entry-level processors from the cloud, so that its 127-qubit Eagle processor would be the smallest one that the company would make available. The move is aimed at pushing researchers to prioritize truly useful tasks. Eagle is a “utility-scale” processor, IBM says—when correctly handled, it can “provide useful results to problems that challenge the best scalable classical methods.”  Companies are moving away from setting qubit records in favor of practical hardware and long-term goals. It’s a controversial claim—many doubt that Eagle really is capable of outperforming suitably prepared classical machines. But classical computers are already struggling to keep up with it, and IBM has even larger systems: the 433-qubit Osprey processor, which is also cloud-accessible, and the 1,121-qubit Condor processor, which debuted in December. (Gambetta has a simple rationale for the way he names IBM’s quantum processors: “I like birds.”) The company has a new modular design, called Heron, and Flamingo is slated to appear in 2025—with fully quantum connections between chips that allow the quantum information to flow between different processors unhindered, enabling truly large-scale quantum computation. That will make 2025 the first year that quantum computing will be provably scalable, Gambetta says: “I’m aiming for 2025 to be an important year for demonstrating key technologies that allow us to scale to hundreds of thousands of qubits.” IQM’s Tan is astonished at the pace of development. “It’s mind-boggling how fast this field is progressing,” he says. “When I was working in this field 10 years ago, I would never have expected to have a 10-qubit chip at this point. Now we’re talking about hundreds already, and potentially thousands in the coming years.”  It’s not just IBM. Campbell has been impressed by Google’s quiet but emphatic progress, for instance. “They operate differently, but they have hit the milestones on their public road map,” he says. “They seem to be doing what they say they will do.” Other household-name companies are embracing quantum computing too. “We’re seeing Intel using their top-line machines, the ones that they use for making chips, to make quantum devices,” Tan says. Intel is following a technology path very different from IBM’s: creating qubits in silicon devices that the company knows how to manufacture at scale, with minimal noise-inducing defects.  As quantum computing hits its stride and quantum computers begin to process real-world data, technological and geographical diversity will be important to avoid geopolitical issues and problems with data-sharing regulations.  There are restrictions, for instance, aimed at maintaining national security—which will perhaps limit the market opportunities of multinational giants such as IBM and Google. At the beginning of 2022, France’s defense minister declared quantum technologies to be of “strategic interest” while announcing a new national program of research. In July 2023, Deutsche Telekom announced a new partnership with IQM for cloud-based access to quantum computing, calling it a way for DT customers to access a “truly sovereign quantum environment, built and managed from within Europe.”  This is not just nationalistic bluster: sovereignty matters. DT is leading the European Commission’s development of a quantum-­based, EU-wide high-security communications infrastructure; as the era approaches when large-scale quantum computers pose a serious threat to standard encryption protocols, governments and commercial organizations will want to be able to test “post-quantum” encryption algorithms—ones that withstand attack by any quantum computer, irrespective of its size—within their own borders.  Not that this is a problem yet. Few people think that a security-destroying large-scale quantum processor is just around the corner. But there is certainly a growing belief in the field’s potential to be transformative—and useful—in other ways within just a few years. And these days, that belief is based on real-world achievements. “At Algorithmiq, we believe in a future where quantum utility will happen soon, but I can trace this optimism back to patents and publications,” Maniscalco says.  The only downside for her is that not everybody has come around the way she has. Quantum computing is here now, she insists—but the old objections die hard, and many people refuse to see it.  “There is still a lot of misunderstanding: I get very upset when I see or hear certain conversations,” she says. “Sometimes I wish I had a magic wand that could open people’s eyes.”  Michael Brooks is a freelance science journalist based in the UK.

So far , it seems to work at reasonably large scales . On top of all that , there has been a growing roster of achievements in “ quantum error correction , ” or QEC . Instead of holding a qubit ’ s worth of information in one qubit , QEC encodes it in the quantum states of a set of qubits . A noise-induced error in any one of those is not as catastrophic as it would be if the information were held by a single qubit : by monitoring each of the additional qubits , it ’ s possible to detect any change and correct it before the information becomes unusable . Implementing QEC has long been considered one of the essential steps on the path to large-scale , noise-tolerant quantum computing—to machines that can achieve all the promise of the technology , such as the ability to crack popular encryption schemes . The trouble is , QEC uses a lot of overhead . The gold-standard error correction architecture , known as a surface code , requires at least 13 physical qubits to protect a single useful “ logical ” qubit . As you connect logical qubits together , that number balloons : a useful processor might require 1,000 physical qubits for every logical qubit . There are now multiple reasons to be optimistic even about this , however . In July 2022 , for instance , Google ’ s researchers published a demonstration of a surface code in action where performance got better—not worse—when more qubits were connected together . That so many noise-handling techniques are flourishing is a huge deal—especially at a time when the notion that we might get something useful out of small-scale , noisy processors has turned out to be a bust . There have also been promising demonstrations of theoretical alternatives to surface codes . In August 2023 , an IBM team that included Gambetta showed an error correction technique that could control the errors in a 12-qubit memory circuit using an extra 276 qubits , a big improvement over the thousands of extra qubits required by surface codes . In September , two other teams demonstrated similar improvements with a fault-tolerant circuit called a CCZ gate , using superconducting circuitry and ion-trap processors . That so many noise-handling techniques are flourishing is a huge deal—especially at a time when the notion that we might get something useful out of small-scale , noisy processors has turned out to be a bust . Actual error correction is not yet happening on commercially available quantum processors ( and is not generally implementable as a real-time process during computations ) . But Biercuk sees quantum computing as finally hitting its stride . “ I think we ’ re well on the way now , ” he says . “ I don ’ t see any fundamental issues at all. ” And these innovations are happening alongside general improvements in hardware performance—meaning that there are ever fewer baseline errors in the functioning qubits—and an increase in the number of qubits on each processor , making bigger and more useful calculations possible . Biercuk says he is starting to see places where he might soon choose a quantum computer over the best-­performing classical machines . Neither a classical nor a quantum computer can fully solve large-scale tasks like finding the optimal routes for a nationwide fleet of delivery trucks . But , Biercuk points out , accessing and running the best classical supercomputers costs a great deal of money—potentially more than accessing and running a quantum computer that might even give a slightly better solution . “ Look at what high-performance computing centers are doing on a daily basis , ” says Kuan Tan , CTO and cofounder of the Finland-based quantum computer provider IQM . “ They ’ re running power-hungry scientific calculations that are reachable [ by ] quantum computers that will consume much less power. ” A quantum computer doesn ’ t have to be a better computer than any other kind of machine to attract paying customers , Tan says . It just has to be comparable in performance and cheaper to run . He expects we ’ ll achieve that quantum energy advantage in the next three to five years . A debate has long raged about what target quantum computing researchers should be aiming for in their bid to compete with classical computers . Quantum supremacy , the goal Google has pursued—a demonstration that a quantum computer can solve a problem no classical computer can crack in a reasonable amount of time ? Or quantum advantage—superior performance when it comes to a useful problem—as IBM has preferred ? Or quantum utility , IBM ’ s newest buzzword ? The semantics reflect differing views of what near-term objectives are important . In June , IBM announced that it would begin retiring its entry-level processors from the cloud , so that its 127-qubit Eagle processor would be the smallest one that the company would make available . The move is aimed at pushing researchers to prioritize truly useful tasks . Eagle is a “ utility-scale ” processor , IBM says—when correctly handled , it can “ provide useful results to problems that challenge the best scalable classical methods. ” Companies are moving away from setting qubit records in favor of practical hardware and long-term goals . It ’ s a controversial claim—many doubt that Eagle really is capable of outperforming suitably prepared classical machines . But classical computers are already struggling to keep up with it , and IBM has even larger systems : the 433-qubit Osprey processor , which is also cloud-accessible , and the 1,121-qubit Condor processor , which debuted in December . ( Gambetta has a simple rationale for the way he names IBM ’ s quantum processors : “ I like birds. ” ) The company has a new modular design , called Heron , and Flamingo is slated to appear in 2025—with fully quantum connections between chips that allow the quantum information to flow between different processors unhindered , enabling truly large-scale quantum computation . That will make 2025 the first year that quantum computing will be provably scalable , Gambetta says : “ I ’ m aiming for 2025 to be an important year for demonstrating key technologies that allow us to scale to hundreds of thousands of qubits. ” IQM ’ s Tan is astonished at the pace of development . “ It ’ s mind-boggling how fast this field is progressing , ” he says . “ When I was working in this field 10 years ago , I would never have expected to have a 10-qubit chip at this point . Now we ’ re talking about hundreds already , and potentially thousands in the coming years. ” It ’ s not just IBM . Campbell has been impressed by Google ’ s quiet but emphatic progress , for instance . “ They operate differently , but they have hit the milestones on their public road map , ” he says . “ They seem to be doing what they say they will do. ” Other household-name companies are embracing quantum computing too . “ We ’ re seeing Intel using their top-line machines , the ones that they use for making chips , to make quantum devices , ” Tan says . Intel is following a technology path very different from IBM ’ s : creating qubits in silicon devices that the company knows how to manufacture at scale , with minimal noise-inducing defects . As quantum computing hits its stride and quantum computers begin to process real-world data , technological and geographical diversity will be important to avoid geopolitical issues and problems with data-sharing regulations . There are restrictions , for instance , aimed at maintaining national security—which will perhaps limit the market opportunities of multinational giants such as IBM and Google . At the beginning of 2022 , France ’ s defense minister declared quantum technologies to be of “ strategic interest ” while announcing a new national program of research . In July 2023 , Deutsche Telekom announced a new partnership with IQM for cloud-based access to quantum computing , calling it a way for DT customers to access a “ truly sovereign quantum environment , built and managed from within Europe. ” This is not just nationalistic bluster : sovereignty matters . DT is leading the European Commission ’ s development of a quantum-­based , EU-wide high-security communications infrastructure ; as the era approaches when large-scale quantum computers pose a serious threat to standard encryption protocols , governments and commercial organizations will want to be able to test “ post-quantum ” encryption algorithms—ones that withstand attack by any quantum computer , irrespective of its size—within their own borders . Not that this is a problem yet . Few people think that a security-destroying large-scale quantum processor is just around the corner . But there is certainly a growing belief in the field ’ s potential to be transformative—and useful—in other ways within just a few years . And these days , that belief is based on real-world achievements . “ At Algorithmiq , we believe in a future where quantum utility will happen soon , but I can trace this optimism back to patents and publications , ” Maniscalco says . The only downside for her is that not everybody has come around the way she has . Quantum computing is here now , she insists—but the old objections die hard , and many people refuse to see it . “ There is still a lot of misunderstanding : I get very upset when I see or hear certain conversations , ” she says . “ Sometimes I wish I had a magic wand that could open people ’ s eyes. ” Michael Brooks is a freelance science journalist based in the UK .","['past', 'year',

The online art catalogue that chronicles a stolen African heritage,https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/01/04/1084777/digital-benin-project-nigeria-art-repatriation/,2024-01-04,"<p>The Digital Benin project provides a central place to see artifacts that are now scattered around the Global North. Its organizers hope it will be the first step toward repatriation.</p>
","When British forces raided the African kingdom of Benin in the late 19th century, they took with them thousands of sculptures dating back centuries. Sold to private collectors and museums in the Global North, the artifacts, known as the Benin Bronzes, included ceremonial swords, ritualistic statues, and musical instruments that belonged to the Edo people. Their looting had a profound impact on the community, descendants of which live in and around modern-day Benin City in southern Nigeria. It effectively severed the connection between them and their cultural heritage. Despite longstanding pressure, many institutions, particularly in Germany and the UK, have resisted calls to share information about the Benin Bronzes in their collection. This makes it difficult to determine how many there are outside Nigeria, and where.  But the launch in November 2022 of a pioneering platform called Digital Benin has changed that. Hosted by the Museum am Rothenbaum (MARKK) in Hamburg, Digital Benin is an online catalogue of more than 5,000 Benin Bronzes. The aim is to use technology to reestablish a community’s link to artifacts that were looted from native lands. The catalogue includes, for the first time, Edo-centric knowledge, history, and language, including traditional Edo names for the objects and the locations where they originated. The platform was built by a team based in the US, Europe, and Nigeria with an initial €1.2 million from a fine-art foundation in Berlin called Ernst von Siemens Kunststiftung. It has been designed specifically to ensure accessibility for people who use the internet predominantly via mobile, as most Nigerians do.  Faults in a certain part of the immune system might be at the root of some long covid cases, new research suggests. Anne Luther, a digital heritage specialist and one of Digital Benin’s principal investigators, hopes the project will be a model for other communities that want to explore how technology can be used to help them reconnect with and reclaim stolen artifacts. “Before Digital Benin, digital restitution was not a conversation being had by larger institutions,” Luther says.  In building the catalogue, the team received more than 400 data sets from 131 institutions in 20 countries, which they then drew from in order to make the objects accessible, findable, and traceable. Luther says being able to assure institutions that they would be able to retain their rights to and ownership of any data sets they shared meant that more institutions were willing to do so. But she says the site is just a step on the road to restoring the artifacts to the Edo. Pressure to make such restitution has been growing on a number of governments and institutions, including the British Museum, which has more than 900 objects. And there are signs the pressure is working: Germany, for example, has repatriated 21 Benin Bronzes formerly stored in its institutions. Eiloghosa Obobaifo, an anthropologist based in Benin City, says the site has been helping locals, including contemporary bronze casters who make sculptures with ancient techniques, reconnect with their history. “Bronze casters have becomevery dependent on the platform and use it to see objects they could re-create,” says Obobaifo, who carried out research for the project. “It has also had an impact on education, with students using the platform for research. It has been encouraging for me to see people appreciate the information we have put out there.” Luther is developing a new project—contingent on funding—with the Living Arts Foundation in Cambodia to preserve the country’s performing arts traditions. Digital Benin, meanwhile, has expanded to include more than 4,000 archival documents linked to the Benin Bronzes. But the team hopes the Digital Benin model can grow to a global scale. “The long-term goal is to develop a database that connects all objects in all institutions worldwide,” Luther says. She estimates that it would take $5 million over five years to develop and maintain an expanded prototype system.  Gouri Sharma is a journalist based in Berlin. This story has been updated to more accurately reflect the goal of Digital Benin. ","When British forces raided the African kingdom of Benin in the late 19th century , they took with them thousands of sculptures dating back centuries . Sold to private collectors and museums in the Global North , the artifacts , known as the Benin Bronzes , included ceremonial swords , ritualistic statues , and musical instruments that belonged to the Edo people . Their looting had a profound impact on the community , descendants of which live in and around modern-day Benin City in southern Nigeria . It effectively severed the connection between them and their cultural heritage . Despite longstanding pressure , many institutions , particularly in Germany and the UK , have resisted calls to share information about the Benin Bronzes in their collection . This makes it difficult to determine how many there are outside Nigeria , and where . But the launch in November 2022 of a pioneering platform called Digital Benin has changed that . Hosted by the Museum am Rothenbaum ( MARKK ) in Hamburg , Digital Benin is an online catalogue of more than 5,000 Benin Bronzes . The aim is to use technology to reestablish a community ’ s link to artifacts that were looted from native lands . The catalogue includes , for the first time , Edo-centric knowledge , history , and language , including traditional Edo names for the objects and the locations where they originated . The platform was built by a team based in the US , Europe , and Nigeria with an initial €1.2 million from a fine-art foundation in Berlin called Ernst von Siemens Kunststiftung . It has been designed specifically to ensure accessibility for people who use the internet predominantly via mobile , as most Nigerians do . Faults in a certain part of the immune system might be at the root of some long covid cases , new research suggests . Anne Luther , a digital heritage specialist and one of Digital Benin ’ s principal investigators , hopes the project will be a model for other communities that want to explore how technology can be used to help them reconnect with and reclaim stolen artifacts . “ Before Digital Benin , digital restitution was not a conversation being had by larger institutions , ” Luther says . In building the catalogue , the team received more than 400 data sets from 131 institutions in 20 countries , which they then drew from in order to make the objects accessible , findable , and traceable . Luther says being able to assure institutions that they would be able to retain their rights to and ownership of any data sets they shared meant that more institutions were willing to do so . But she says the site is just a step on the road to restoring the artifacts to the Edo . Pressure to make such restitution has been growing on a number of governments and institutions , including the British Museum , which has more than 900 objects . And there are signs the pressure is working : Germany , for example , has repatriated 21 Benin Bronzes formerly stored in its institutions .

We need a moonshot for computing,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/28/1084686/computing-microelectronics-chips-act/,2023-12-28,"<p>The US government aims to push microelectronics research forward. But maintaining competitiveness in the long term will require embracing uncertainty.</p>
","In its final weeks, the Obama administration released a report that rippled through the federal science and technology community. Titled Ensuring Long-Term US Leadership in Semiconductors, it warned that as conventional ways of building chips brushed up against the laws of physics, the United States was at risk of losing its edge in the chip industry. Five and a half years later, in 2022, Congress and the White House collaborated to address that possibility by passing the CHIPS and Science Act—a bold venture patterned after the Manhattan Project, the Apollo program, and the Human Genome Project. Over the course of three administrations, the US government has begun to organize itself for the next era of computing. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo has gone so far as to directly compare the passage of CHIPS to President John F. Kennedy’s 1961 call to land a man on the moon. In doing so, she was evoking a US tradition of organizing the national innovation ecosystem to meet an audacious technological objective—one that the private sector alone could not reach. Before JFK’s announcement, there were organizational challenges and disagreement over the best path forward to ensure national competitiveness in space. Such is the pattern of technological ambitions left to their own timelines.  Setting national policy for technological development involves making trade-offs and grappling with unknown future issues. How does a government account for technological uncertainty? What will the nature of its interaction with the private sector be? And does it make more sense to focus on boosting competitiveness in the near term or to place big bets on potential breakthroughs?  The CHIPS and Science Act designated $39 billion for bringing chip factories, or “fabs,” and their key suppliers back to the United States, with an additional $11 billion committed to microelectronics R&D. At the center of the R&D program would be the National Semiconductor Technology Center, or NSTC—envisioned as a national “center of excellence” that would bring the best of the innovation ecosystem together to invent the next generation of microelectronics.   In the year and a half since, CHIPS programs and offices have been stood up, and chip fabrication facilities in Arizona, Texas, and Ohio have broken ground. But it is the CHIPS R&D program that has an opportunity to shape the future of the field. Ultimately, there is a choice to make in terms of national R&D goals: the US can adopt a conservative strategy that aims to preserve its lead for the next five years, or it can orient itself toward genuine computing moonshots. The way the NSTC is organized, and the technology programs it chooses to pursue, will determine whether the United States plays it safe or goes “all in.”  In 1965, the late Intel founder Gordon Moore famously predicted that the path forward for computing involved cramming more transistors, or tiny switches, onto flat silicon wafers. Extrapolating from the birth of the integrated circuit seven years earlier, Moore forecast that transistor count would double regularly while the cost per transistor fell. But Moore was not merely making a prediction. He was also prescribing a technological strategy (sometimes called “transistor scaling”): shrink transistors and pack them closer and closer together, and chips become faster and cheaper. This approach not only led to the rise of a $600 billion semiconductor industry but ushered the world into the digital age.  Generative AI took the world by storm in 2023. Its future—and ours—will be shaped by what we do next. Ever insightful, Moore did not expect that transistor scaling would last forever. He referred to the point when this miniaturization process would reach its physical limits as the “day of reckoning.” The chip industry is now very close to reaching that day, if it is not there already. Costs are skyrocketing and technical challenges are mounting. Industry road maps suggest that we may have only about 10 to 15 years before transistor scaling reaches its physical limits—and it may stop being profitable even before that.  To keep chips advancing in the near term, the semiconductor industry has adopted a two-part strategy. On the one hand, it is building “accelerator” chips tailored for specific applications (such as AI inference and training) to speed computation. On the other, firms are building hardware from smaller functional components—called “chiplets”—to reduce costs and improve customizability. These chiplets can be arranged side by side or stacked on top of one another. The 3D approach could be an especially powerful means of improving speeds.  This two-part strategy will help over the next 10 years or so, but it has long-term limits. For one thing, it continues to rely on the same transistor-building method that is currently reaching the end of the line. And even with 3D integration, we will continue to grapple with energy-hungry communication bottlenecks. It is unclear how long this approach will enable chipmakers to produce cheaper and more capable computers.   The clear alternative is to develop alternatives to conventional computing. There is no shortage of candidates, including quantum computing; neuromorphic computing, which mimics the operation of the brain in hardware; and reversible computing, which has the potential to push the energy efficiency of computing to its physical limits. And there are plenty of novel materials and devices that could be used to build future computers, such as silicon photonics, magnetic materials,and superconductor electronics. These possibilities could even be combined to form hybrid computing systems. None of these potential technologies are new: researchers have been working on them for many years, and quantum computing is certainly making progress in the private sector. But only Washington brings the convening power and R&D dollars to help these novel systems achieve scale. Traditionally, breakthroughs in microelectronics have emerged piecemeal, but realizing new approaches to computation requires building an entirely new computing “stack”—from the hardware level up to the algorithms and software. This requires an approach that can rally the entire innovation ecosystem around clear objectives to tackle multiple technical problems in tandem and provide the kind of support needed to “de-risk” otherwise risky ventures. Does it make more sense to focus on boosting competitiveness in the near term or to place big bets on potential breakthroughs? The NSTC can drive these efforts. To be successful, it would do well to follow DARPA’s lead by focusing on moonshot programs. Its research program will need to be insulated from outside pressures. It also needs to foster visionaries, including program managers from industry and academia, and back them with a large in-house technical staff.  The center’s investment fund also needs to be thoughtfully managed, drawing on best practices from existing blue-chip deep-tech investment funds, such as ensuring transparency through due-diligence practices and offering entrepreneurs access to tools, facilities, and training.  It is still early days for the NSTC: the road to success may be long and winding. But this is a crucial moment for US leadership in computing and microelectronics. As we chart the path forward for the NSTC and other R&D priorities, we’ll need to think critically about what kinds of institutions we’ll need to get us there. We may not get another chance to get it right.

Recapturing early-internet whimsy with HTML,https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/21/1084525/internet-whimsy-html-energy/,2023-12-21,"<p>Modern forms of coding make most websites feel like commercial transactions. The HTML Energy movement aims to bring back the joys of the early days.</p>
","Websites weren’t always slick digital experiences.  There was a time when surfing the web involved opening tabs that played music against your will and sifting through walls of Times New Roman text on a colored background. In the 2000s, before Squarespace and social media, websites were manifestations of individuality—built entirely from scratch using HTML, by users who had some knowledge of code and a desire to be on the internet.  Scattered across the web are communities of programmers working to revive this seemingly outdated approach. Anchored in the concept of “HTML Energy,” a term coined by artists Laurel Schwulst and Elliott Cost, the movement is anything but a superficial appeal to retro aesthetics. It focuses on the tactile process of coding in HTML, exploring how the language invites self-expression and empowers individuals to claim their share of the web. Taking shape in small Discord channels and digital magazines, among other spaces, the HTML Energy movement is about celebrating the human touch in digital experiences.  Today, the majority of the internet is optimized for social engagement, e-commerce, and streaming. Most internet traffic is concentrated in a small number of sites, all of which are owned by the same handful of companies. From lengthy ads to aggressive cookie settings, minor obstacles and nuisances are baked in. Users are constantly reminded that their access to the internet is conditional on the monetary interests of a few. The situation with X (formerly known as Twitter) perfectly encapsulates this state of internet ownership: it only took one executive to spark a mass exodus from the platform and to fragment its long-lived communities. However, despite the monopolistic landscape of Big Tech, one fundamental reality continues to justify the internet’s democratic reputation: anyone can publish a website for free with HTML. With an abundance of real estate, the web technically has space for everyone. It’s just a matter of traffic.  When I spoke to different members of the HTML Energy community, all consistently returned to one basic message: Everything on the web boils down to HTML. HTML is the backbone of any website. It’s the only thing needed for a website to run. While popular web development languages today use abridged commands that hide technical complexity through what’s known as data abstraction, HTML is granular, and previous coding knowledge is not a prerequisite.  As Cost explains, it is precisely how forgiving HTML is that gives eager individuals an opportunity to self-publish on the web. With HTML, a site will still load even if a line of code is missing. The HTML Energy movement embraces these possibilities: learning via trial and error is welcomed, and creative experimentation is encouraged.  Since the rise of site-building tools like Wix, the intricate and sometimes clunky experience of hard-coding fonts or pixel spacing into a site has been replaced by templates and conventions of user experience design. As mainstream digital experiences trend toward a homogeneous visual language, the human touch gets lost in the many layers of abstraction. Site creators grow more distant from their sites, and the web becomes more transactional. But the HTML Energy movement calls on people to reexamine our relationship with technology. Crafting a site using HTML allows programmers to explore what a website can be. Unlike their corporate counterparts, people creating sites on their own don’t answer to shareholders. They don’t have the pressure to create profitable experiences, so their creations can take an endless variety of forms.  In an excerpt from Broken Code: Inside Facebook and the Fight to Expose its Harmful Secrets, Jeff Horwitz reveals how the company came to rely on artificial intelligence. Common types of HTML Energy sites include digital gardens, where elements change with the seasons; interactive poetry generators, where inputs from the user give rise to new meaning; and personal sites that share intimate details about their creators’ lives. In an internet that is increasingly consumerist, HTML Energy sites offer a gentle reminder that websites can be meditative experiences.  The HTML Energy community advocates understanding HTML for what it quite literally is: a language. And it celebrates the way the rudimentary character of that language demands intention from the user. As an amalgamation of minuscule and intricate creative decisions, a site constructed using only HTML is a form of self-­expression. Viewing a site’s source code is as important as navigating its interface. There are often Easter eggs hidden in that code, such as cheeky messages or citations taken from other HTML sites. In many ways, an HTML site captures something of the creator’s identity: what did that individual choose to build, and how? This fascination with different applications of HTML is also seen in physical community gatherings sometimes called “freewrites,” where members of the movement get together to write code. Sunday Sites and Fruitful School are among the websites that organize these gatherings, often integrating educational elements into their sessions to empower more people to join the movement. Meanwhile, sites like HTML Review showcase some of its products in the format of a literary magazine.  Ji Kim’s Terrarium of Many Sceneries collages snippets of footage from an old iPhone. As visitors scroll through the site, images overlap and embedded audio clips play. When users click any image, a small description of when and where it was taken appears, alongside more accompanying media. Kim’s site is designed to mimic the sporadic, layered nature of memory. It is a digital experience that is intentionally fragmented and overwhelming—like trying to remember a family trip taken years ago.  Shelby Wilson’s A Room with a Window is a site that allows for only one interaction: opening and closing a set of window shades. The site intentionally conflates physical and digital spaces: Wilson plays with the idea of a browser as a portal to a place with physical boundaries and edges, but also maintains surrealist components (the room doesn’t get darker when the blinds close) and randomized elements (the color of the room changes on each visit) to highlight the digital form. Spencer Chang’s site imagines what a garden might look like on the internet. Several “plants” made of native HTML elements grow, and the passage of time is acknowledged and noticeable upon each visit—seasons change, plants sprout and bloom. There’s no explicit action called for—just observation. Katherine Yang’s Prose Play is an interactive poem that encourages users to input different words into a pre-set sentence structure. Framing words as variables, the site explores the interactivity of the internet. It puts the literary theory of the “Death of the Author”—the idea that the meaning of a text is not determined by the author’s intention but by the reader’s interpretation—in the context of code.  Erich Friedman’s site is a personal encyclopedia of his life, with archives of everything from movie ratings to reviews of mini-golf courses across central Florida. Organized into the categories of Math Stuff, Puzzle Stuff, Personal Stuff, and Professional Stuff, the site is simple in structure. It uses basic HTML to showcase Friedman’s eclectic interests over the past decade, including a list of fun facts for every number from 0 to 9,999 and collections of math and trivia problems. The site does not drive any specific action. It merely stands as an exhaustive, candid portrait of Erich Friedman, occupying a small piece of the web.  Toulou TouMou’s Museum of Screens is a site that houses browser games created by game enthusiasts. In order to interact with the games on display, users have to navigate the digital space like a physical museum visualized in ASCII graphics. There are actual visiting hours, with a “rest day” chosen at random. Created to give due credit to amateur developers during the era of Flash games, TouMou’s museum aims to highlight the importance of acknowledging authorship and the rich history of independent games.  There is no centralized source for HTML Energy sites: serendipity makes them finding them feel special, like happening upon a piece of street art behind a parking lot. They’re not designed for discovery, nor are they optimized for any particular action. They simply engage with a visitor on the visitor’s terms, offering a portrait of their creator. If sites like Google or Facebook are the supermarkets and shopping malls where you buy your necessities, HTML Energy sites are like the hidden gardens you happen upon, unmarked on any map.  Tiffany Ng is a freelance writer exploring the relationship between art, tech, and culture. ","Websites weren ’ t always slick digital experiences . There was a time when surfing the web involved opening tabs that played music against your will and sifting through walls of Times New Roman text on a colored background . In the 2000s , before Squarespace and social media , websites were manifestations of individuality—built entirely from scratch using HTML , by users who had some knowledge of code and a desire to be on the internet . Scattered across the web are communities of programmers working to revive this seemingly outdated approach . Anchored in the concept of “ HTML Energy , ” a term coined by artists Laurel Schwulst and Elliott Cost , the movement is anything but a superficial appeal to retro aesthetics . It focuses on the tactile process of coding in HTML , exploring how the language invites self-expression and empowers individuals to claim their share of the web . Taking shape in small Discord channels and digital magazines , among other spaces , the HTML Energy movement is about celebrating the human touch in digital experiences . Today , the majority of the internet is optimized for social engagement , e-commerce , and streaming . Most internet traffic is concentrated in a small number of sites , all of which are owned by the same handful of companies . From lengthy ads to aggressive cookie settings , minor obstacles and nuisances are baked in . Users are constantly reminded that their access to the internet is conditional on the monetary interests of a few . The situation with X ( formerly known as Twitter ) perfectly encapsulates this state of internet ownership : it only took one executive to spark a mass exodus from the platform and to fragment its long-lived communities . However , despite the monopolistic landscape of Big Tech , one fundamental reality continues to justify the internet ’ s democratic reputation : anyone can publish a website for free with HTML . With an abundance of real estate , the web technically has space for everyone . It ’ s just a matter of traffic . When I spoke to different members of the HTML Energy community , all consistently returned to one basic message : Everything on the web boils down to HTML . HTML is the backbone of any website . It ’ s the only thing needed for a website to run . While popular web development languages today use abridged commands that hide technical complexity through what ’ s known as data abstraction , HTML is granular , and previous coding knowledge is not a prerequisite . As Cost explains , it is precisely how forgiving HTML is that gives eager individuals an opportunity to self-publish on the web . With HTML , a site will still load even if a line of code is missing . The HTML Energy movement embraces these possibilities : learning via trial and error is welcomed , and creative experimentation is encouraged .
