        This AI Chip Hits New Ultralow Power Lows
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/low-power-ai-spiking-neural-net,2022-06-15,"Its neural spikes take just 0.02 percent of the energy needed to fire comparable neural networks  Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (including professors Maryam Shojaei Baghini and Udayan Ganguly, standing) have announced a new, low-power AI chip, pictured here, that enables what are called spiking neural networks or SNNs.   This article is part of our exclusive IEEE Journal Watch series in partnership with IEEE Xplore. Our brains may not be big, but they pack a lot of computing power, given their size. For this reason, many researchers have been interested in creating artificial networks that mimic the neural signal processing of the brain. These artificial networks, called spiking neural networks (SNNs), could be used to create intelligent robots, or to better understand the underpinnings of the brain itself.  However, the brain has 100 billion tiny neurons, each of which are connected to 10,000 other neurons via synapses and which represent information through coordinated patterns of electrical spiking. Mimicking these neurons using hardware on a compact device—all while ensuring that computation is done in an energy-efficient manner—has proven challenging.  In a recent study, researchers in India achieved ultralow-energy artificial neurons that allow the SNNs to be more compactly arranged. The results are published 25 May in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers. Just as neurons in the brain spike at a given energy threshold,  SNNs rely on a network of artificial neurons where a current source charges up a leaky capacitor until a threshold level is hit and the artificial neurons fires, and the stored charge is reset to zero. However, many existing SNNs require large transistor currents to charge up their capacitors, which leads to high power consumption or artificial neurons that fire too quickly.  In their study, Udayan Ganguly, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, and his colleagues created a SNN that relies on a new and compact current source to charge capacitors, called band-to-band-tunneling (BTBT) current.  With BTBT, quantum tunneling current charges up the capacitor with ultralow current, meaning less energy is required. Quantum tunneling in this case means the current can flow through the forbidden gap in the silicon of the artificial neuron via quantum-wave-like behavior. The BTBT approach also spares the need for large capacitors to store high amounts of current, paving the way for smaller capacitors on a chip and thus saving space. When the researchers tested their BTBT neuron approach using 45-nanometer commercial silicon-on-insulator transistor technology, they saw substantial energy and space savings.  “In comparison to state-of-art [artificial] neurons implemented in hardware spiking neural networks, we achieved 5,000 times lower energy per spike at a similar area and 10 times lower standby power at a similar area and energy per spike,” explains Ganguly. The researchers then applied their SNN to a model of speech recognition inspired by the brain’s auditory cortex. Using 20 artificial neurons for initial input coding and 36 additional artificial neurons, the model could effectively recognize spoken words, demonstrating real-world feasibility of the approach.  Notably, this type of technology could be well suited for a range of applications, including voice-activity detection, speech classification, motion-pattern recognition, navigation, biomedical signals, classification, and more. And Ganguly notes that while these applications can be done using current servers and supercomputers, SNNs could enable these applications to be used with edge devices, such as mobile phones and IoT sensors—and especially when energy constraints are tight.  He says that while his team has shown their BTBT approach to be usefulfor specific applications such as keyword detection, they are interested in demonstrating a general-purpose reusable neurosynaptic core for a wide variety of applications and clients, and have created a startup company, called Numelo Tech, to drive commercialization. Their goal, he says, “is an extremely low-power neurosynaptic core and developing a real-time on-chip learning mechanism, which are key for autonomous biologically inspired neural networks. This is the holy grail.” Michelle Hampson is a freelance writer based in Halifax.

        Photonic Chip Performs Image Recognition at the Speed of Light
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/photonic-neural-network,2022-06-06,"New photonic deep neural network could also analyze audio, video, and other data The chip uses a deep neural network of optical waveguides smaller than a square centimeter. The network can detect and classify an image in less than a nanosecond, without the need for a separate processor or memory unit. Deep neural networks that mimic the workings of the human brain now often power computer vision, speech recognition, and much more. However, they are increasingly limited by the hardware used to implement them. Now scientists have developed a deep neural network on a photonic microchip that can classify images in less than a nanosecond, roughly the same amount of time as a single tick of the kind of clocks found in state-of-the-art electronics. In artificial neural networks, components dubbed “neurons” are fed data and cooperate to solve a problem, such as recognizing faces. The neural net repeatedly adjusts the links between its neurons and sees if the resulting patterns of behavior are better at finding a solution. Over time, the network discovers which patterns are best at computing results. It then adopts these as defaults, mimicking the process of learning in the human brain. A neural network is called “deep” if it possesses multiple layers of neurons. Although these artificial-intelligence systems are increasingly finding real-world applications, they face a number of major challenges given the hardware used to run them. First, they are usually implemented using digital-clock-based platforms such as graphics processing units (GPUs), which limits their computation speed to the frequencies of the clocks—less than 3 gigahertz for most state-of-the-art GPUs. Second, unlike biological neurons—which can both compute and store data—conventional electronics separate memory and processing units. Shuttling data back and forth between these components wastes both time and energy. In addition, raw visual data usually needs to be converted to digital electronic signals, consuming time. Moreover, a large memory unit is often needed to store images and videos, raising potential privacy concerns. In a new study, researchers have developed a photonic deep neural network that can directly analyze images without the need for a clock, sensor, or large memory modules. It can classify an image in less than 570 picoseconds, which is comparable with a single clock cycle in state-of-the-art microchips. “It can classify nearly 2 billion images per second,” says study senior author Firooz Aflatouni, an electrical engineer at the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia. “As a point of reference, the conventional video frame rate is 24 to 120 frames per second.” The new device marks the first deep neural network implemented entirely on an integrated photonic device in a scalable manner. The entire chip is just 9.3 square millimeters in size. An image of interest is projected onto a 5-by-6 pixel array and divided into four overlapping 3-by-4 pixel subimages. Optical channels, or waveguides, then route the pixels of each subimage to the device’s nine neurons. When the microchip is getting trained to recognize an image, for example, as one letter or another, an electrically controlled device adjusts how each neuron modifies the power of incoming light signals. By analyzing how the light from the image gets modified after passing through the microchip’s layers of neurons, one can read the microchip’s results. “Computation-by-propagation, where the computation takes place as the wave propagates through a medium, can perform computation at the speed of light,” Aflatouni says. The scientists had their microchip identify handwritten letters. In one set of tests, it had to classify 216 letters as either p or d, and in another, it had to classify 432 letters as either p, d, a, or t. The chip showed accuracies higher than 93.8 and 89.8 percent, respectively. In comparison, a 190-neuron conventional deep neural network implemented in Python using the Keras library achieved 96 percent accuracy on the same images. The researchers are now experimenting with classifying video and 3D objects with these devices, as well as using larger chips with more pixels and neurons to classify higher-resolution images. In addition, the applications of this technology “are not limited to image and video classification,” Aflatouni says. “Any signal such as audio and speech that could be converted to the optical domain can be classified almost instantaneously using this technology.” The scientists detailed their findings 1 June in the journal Nature.

An almost Machiavellian plot pitted Fairchild against Texas Instruments In one corner stood the defending champion, Texas Instruments. In the other stood the challenger, Fairchild Semiconductor. The referee, judge, promoter, and only spectator was Polaroid. In contention was the contract for the electronics of Polaroid’s secret project—a pioneering product introduced in 1972 as the SX-70, a camera eventually purchased by millions of people. As the embodiment of truly automated instant photography, the SX-70 fulfilled a long-held dream of Edwin Land, founder of Polaroid Corp., Cambridge, Mass. Vital to this “point and shoot” capability was a new film—one that would develop while exposed to light and so eliminate the tear-away covers of previous Polaroid films. Also vital were sophisticated electronics to control all single lens reflex (SLR) camera functions, including flashbulb selection, exposure control, mirror positioning, start of print development, and ejection of print. These circuits were divided into three modules, one each for motor, exposure and logic, and flash control. At the final count, some 400 transistors were used.

    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/superintelligence-future-life-institute-contest,2022-05-25,"The Future of Life Institute’s contest counters today’s dystopian doomscapes One of the biggest challenges in a world-building competition that asked teams to imagine a positive future with superintelligent AI: Make it plausible.  The Future of Life Institute, a nonprofit that focuses on existential threats to humanity, organized the contest and is offering a hefty prize purse of up to US $140,000, to be divided among multiple winners. Last week FLI announced the 20 finalists from 144 entries, and the group will declare the winners on 15 June.  “We’re not trying to push utopia. We’re just trying to show futures that are not dystopian, so people have something to work toward.”—Anna Yelizarova, Future of Life Institute The contest aims to counter the common dystopian narrative of artificial intelligence that becomes smarter than humans, escapes our control, and makes the world go to hell in one way or another. The philosopher Nick Bostrom famously imagined a factory AI turning all the world’s matter into paper clips to fulfill its objective, and many respected voices in the field, such as computer scientist Stuart Russell, have argued that it’s essential to begin work on AI safety now, before superintelligence is achieved. Add in the sci-fi novels, TV shows, and movies that tell dark tales of AI taking over—the Blade Runners, the Westworlds, the Terminators, the Matrices (both original recipe and Resurrections)—and it’s no wonder the public feels wary of the technology.  Anna Yelizarova, who’s managing the contest and other projects at FLI, says she feels bombarded by images of dystopia in the media, and says it makes her wonder “what kind of effect that has on our worldview as a society.” She sees the contest partly as a way to provide hopeful visions of the future. “We’re not trying to push utopia,” she says, noting that the worlds built for the contest are not perfect places with zero conflicts or struggles. “We’re just trying to show futures that are not dystopian, so people have something to work toward,” she says.  The contest asked a lot from the teams who entered: They had to provide a timeline of events from now until 2045 that includes the invention of artificial general intelligence (AGI), two “day in the life” short stories, answers to a list of questions, and a media piece reflecting their imagined world.   Yelizarova says that another motivation for the contest was to see what sorts of ideas people would come up with. Imagining a hopeful future with AGI is inherently more difficult than imagining a dystopian one, she notes, because it requires coming up with solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing humanity. For example, how to ensure that world governments work together to deploy AGI responsibly and don’t treat its development as an arms race? And how to create AGI agents whose goals are aligned with those of humans? “If people are suggesting new institutions or new ways of tackling problems,” Yelizarova says, “those can become actual policy efforts we can pursue in the real world.” “For a truly positive transformative relationship with AI, it needs to help us—to help humanity—become better.... And the idea that such a world might be possible is a future that I want to fight for.”—Rebecca Rapple, finalist in the Future of Life Institute’s world-building contest It’s worth diving into the worlds created by the 20 finalists and browsing through the positive possible futures. IEEE Spectrum corresponded with two finalists who have very different visions. The first, a solo effort by Rebecca Rapple of Portland, Ore., imagines a world in which an AGI agent named TAI has a direct connection with nearly every human on earth via brain-computer interfaces. The world’s main currency is one of TAI’s devising, called Contribucks, which are earned via positive social contributions and which lose value the longer they’re stored. People routinely plug into a virtual experience called Communitas, which Rapple’s entry describes as “a TAI-facilitated ecstatic group experience where sentience communes, sharing in each other’s experiences directly through TAI.” While TAI is not directly under humans’ control, she has stated that “she loves every soul” and people both trust her and think she’s helping them to live better lives.  Rapple, who describes herself as a pragmatic optimist, says that crafting her world was an uplifting process. “The assumption at the core of my world is that for a truly positive transformative relationship with AI, it needs to help us—to help humanity—become better,” she tells Spectrum. “Better to ourselves, our neighbors, our planet. And the idea that such a world might be possible is a future that I want to fight for.”  The second team Spectrum corresponded with is a trio from Nairobi, Kenya: Conrad Whitaker, Dexter Findley, and Tracey Kamande. In the world imagined by this team, AGI emerged from a “new non–von Neumann computing paradigm” in which memory is fully integrated into processing. As an AGI agent describes it in one of the team's short stories, AGI has resulted “from the digital replication of human brain structure, with all its separate biological components, neural networks and self-referential loops. Nurtured in a naturalistic setting with constant positive human interaction, just like a biological human infant.”  In this world there are over 1,000 AGIs, or digital humans, by the year 2045; the machine learning and neural networks that we know as AI today are widely used for optimization problems, but aren’t considered true, general-purpose intelligence. Those AIs, in so many words, are not AGI. But in the present scenario being imagined, many people live in AGI-organized “digital nations” that they can join regardless of their physical locations, and which bring many health and social benefits.  In an email, the Kenyan team says they aimed to paint a picture of a future that is “strong on freedoms and rights for both humans and AGIs—going so far as imagining that a caring and respectful environment that encouraged unbridled creativity and discourse (conjecture and criticism) was critical to bringing an ‘artificial person’ to maturity in the first place.” They imagine that such AGI agents wouldn’t see themselves as separate from humans as they would be “humanlike” in both their experience of knowledge and their sense of self, and that the AGI agents would therefore have a humanlike capacity for moral knowledge.  Meaning that these AGI agents would see the problem with turning all humans on earth into paper clips. Eliza Strickland is a senior editor at IEEE Spectrum, where she covers AI, biomedical engineering, and other topics. She holds a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University.
 The AI pioneer says it’s time for smart-sized, “data-centric” solutions to big issues  Andrew Ng was involved in the rise of massive deep learning models trained on vast amounts of data, but now he’s preaching small-data solutions.  Andrew Ng has serious street cred in artificial intelligence. He pioneered the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) to train deep learning models in the late 2000s with his students at Stanford University, cofounded Google Brain in 2011, and then served for three years as chief scientist for Baidu, where he helped build the Chinese tech giant’s AI group. So when he says he has identified the next big shift in artificial intelligence, people listen. And that’s what he told IEEE Spectrum in an exclusive Q&A.

        AI’s Threats to Jobs and Human Happiness Are Real
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/kai-fu-lee-ai-jobs,2022-05-12,"But short-term job chaos will give way to long-term prosperity, says AI expert Kai-Fu Lee Renowned computer scientist and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee sees likely disruption over the coming 15 to 20 years, owing to “smart” systems creating jobs in fields that AI-displaced workers may not be well trained to handle.  
	There’s a movement afoot to counter the dystopian and apocalyptic narratives of artificial intelligence. Some people in the field are concerned that the 
	frequent talk of AI as an existential risk to humanity is poisoning the public against the technology and are deliberately setting out more hopeful narratives. One such effort is a book that came out last fall called AI 2041: Ten Visions for Our Future.
 
	The book is cowritten by 
	Kai-Fu Lee, an AI expert who leads the venture capital firm Sinovation Ventures, and Chen Qiufan, a science fiction author known for his novel Waste Tide. It has an interesting format. Each chapter starts with a science fiction story depicting some aspect of AI in society in the year 2041 (such as deepfakes, self-driving cars, and AI-enhanced education), which is followed by an analysis section by Lee that talks about the technology in question and the trends today that may lead to that envisioned future. It’s not a utopian vision, but the stories generally show humanity grappling productively with the issues raised by ever-advancing AI.
 IEEE Spectrum spoke to Lee about the book, focusing on the last few chapters, which take on the big issues of job displacement, the need for new economic models, and the search for meaning and happiness in an age of abundance. Lee argues that technologists need to give serious thought to such societal impacts, instead of thinking only about the technology. 
	Kai-Fu Lee on…
 The science fiction stories are set in 2041, by which time you expect AI to have already caused a lot of disruption to the job market. What types of jobs do you think will be displaced by then? Kai-Fu Lee: Contrary to what a lot of people think, AI is actually just a piece of software that does routine work extremely well. So the jobs that will be the most challenged will be those that are routine and repetitive—and that includes both blue-collar and white-collar work. So obviously jobs like assembly line workers and people who operate the same equipment over and over again. And in terms of white-collar work, many entry-level jobs in accounting, paralegal, and other jobs where you’re repetitively moving data from one place to another, and jobs where you’re routinely dealing with people, such as customer-service jobs. Those are going to be the most challenged. If we add these up, it will be a very substantial portion of all jobs, even without major breakthroughs in AI—on the order of 40 to 50 percent.
 
	The jobs that are most secure are those that require imagination, creativity, or empathy. And until AI gets good enough, there will also be craftsman jobs that require dexterity and a high level of hand-eye coordination. Those jobs will be secure for a while, but AI will improve and eventually take those over as well.
 How do you imagine this trend is changing the engineering profession? Lee: I think engineering is largely cerebral and somewhat creative work that requires analytical skills and deep understanding of problems. And those are generally hard for AI.
 
	But if you’re a software engineer and most of your job is looking for pieces of code and copy-pasting them together—those jobs are in danger. And if you’re doing routine testing of software, those jobs are in danger too. If you’re writing a piece of code and it’s original creative work, but you know that this kind of code has been done before and can be done again, those jobs will gradually be challenged as well. For people in the engineering profession, this will push us towards more of an analytical architect role where we deeply understand the problems that are being solved, ideally problems that have complex characteristics and measurements. The ideal combination in most professions will be a human that has unique human capabilities managing a bunch of AI that do the routine parts.
 
	It reminds me of the Ph.D. thesis of 
	Charles Simonyi, the person who created Microsoft Word. He did an experiment to see what would happen if you have a really smart architect who can divvy up the job of writing a piece of code into well-contained modules that are easy to understand and well defined, and then outsource each module to an average engineer. Will the resulting product be good? It was good. We’re talking about the same thing, except we’re not outsourcing to the average engineer, who will have been replaced by AI. That superengineer will be able to delegate the work to a bunch of AI resulting in creativity and symbiosis. But there won’t be very many of these architect jobs.
 In the book, you say that an entirely new social contract is needed. One problem is that there will be fewer entry-level jobs, but there still needs to be a way for people to gain skills. Can you imagine a solution for engineering? Lee: Let’s say someone is talented and could become an architect, but that person just graduated from college and isn’t there yet. If they apply for a job to do entry-level programming and they’re competing for the job with AI, they might lose the job to the AI. That would be really bad because we will not only hurt the person’s self-confidence, but also society will lose the talent of that architect, which needs years of experience to build up.
 
	But imagine if the company says, “We’re going to employ you anyway, even though you’re not as good as AI. We’re going to give you tasks and we’ll have AI work alongside you and correct your errors, and you can learn from it and improve.” If a thousand people go through this entry-level practical training, maybe a hundred emerge to be really good and be on their way to become architects. Maybe the other 900 will take longer and struggle, or maybe they’ll feel complacent and continue to do the work so they’re passing time and still have a chance to improve. Maybe some will say, “Hey, this is really not for me, I’m not reaching the architect level. I’m going to go become a photographer and artist or whatever.”  Back to top Why do you think that this round of automation is different from those that came before in history, when jobs were both destroyed and created by automation? Lee: First of all, I do think AI will both destroy and create jobs. I just can’t enumerate which jobs and how many. I tend to be an optimist and believe in the wisdom and the will of the human race. Eventually, we’ll figure out a bunch of new jobs. Maybe those jobs don’t exist today and have to be invented; maybe some of those jobs will be service jobs, human-connection jobs. I would say that every technology so far has ended up making society better, and there has never been a problem of absorbing the job losses. If you look at a 30-year horizon, I’m optimistic that that there will not be a net job loss, but possibly a net gain, or possibly equal. And we can always consider a four-day work week and things like that. So long-term, I’m optimistic.
 
	Now to answer your question directly: short-term, I am worried. And the reason is that none of the previous technology revolutions have tried explicitly to replace people. No matter how people think about it, every AI algorithm is trying to display intelligence and therefore be able to do what people do. Maybe not an entire job, but some task. So naturally there will be a short-term drop when automation and AI start to work well.
 
	“If you expect an assembly-line worker to become a robot-repair person, it isn’t going to be so easy.” —Kai-Fu Lee, Sinovation Ventures 
	Autonomous vehicles are an explicit effort to replace drivers. A lot of people in the industry will say, “Oh no, we need a backup driver in the truck to make it safer, so we won’t displace jobs.” Or they’ll say that when we install robots in the factory, the factory workers are elevated to a higher-level job. But I think they’re just sugarcoating the reality.
 
	Let’s say over a period of 20 years, with the advent of AI, we lose x number of jobs, and we also gain x jobs; let’s say the loss and gain are the same. The outcome is not that the society remains in equilibrium, because the jobs being lost are the most routine and unskilled. And the jobs being created are much more likely to be skilled and complex jobs that require much more training. If you expect an assembly-line worker to become a robot-repair person, it isn’t going to be so easy. That’s why I think the next 15 years or 20 years will be very chaotic. We need a lot of wisdom and long-term vision and decisiveness to overcome these problems.
 Back to top Currency There are some interesting experiments going on with universal basic income (UBI), like Sam Altman’s ambitious idea for Worldcoin. But from the book, it seems like you don’t think that UBI is the answer. Is that correct? Lee: UBI may be necessary, by it’s definitely not sufficient. We’re going to be in a world of very serious wealth inequality, and the people losing their jobs won’t have the experience or the education to get the right kinds of training. Unless we subsidize and help these people along, the inequality will be exacerbated. So how do we make them whole? One way is to make sure they don’t have to worry about subsistence. That’s where I think universal basic income comes into play by making sure nobody goes without food, shelter, water. I think that level of universal basic income is good.
 
	As I mentioned before, the people who are most devastated, people who don’t have skills, are going to need a lot of help. But that help isn’t just money. If you just give people money, a wonderful apartment, really great food, Internet, games, and even extra allowance to spend, they are much more likely to say, “Well, I’ll just stay home and play games. I’ll go into the metaverse.” They may even go to alcohol or substance abuse because those are the easiest things to do.
 So what else do they need? Lee: Imagine the mind-set of a person whose job was taken away by automation. That person has been to be thinking, “Wow, everything I know how to do, AI can do. Everything I learn, AI will be able to do. So why should I take the universal basic income and apply that to learning?” And even if that person does decide to get training, how can they know what to get training on? Imagine I’m an assembly-line worker and I lost my job. I might think, truck driver, that’s a highly paid job. I’ll do that. But then in five years those jobs are going to be gone. A robot-repair job would be a much more sustainable job than a truck driver, but the person who just lost a job doesn’t know it.
 
	So the point I make in the book is: To help people stay gainfully employed and have hope for themselves, it’s important that they get guidance on what jobs they can do that will, first of all, give people a sense of contribution, because then at least we eliminate the possibility of social unrest. Second, that job should be interesting, so the person wants to do it. Third, if possible, that job should have economic value.
 Why do you put economic value last in that list? Lee: Most people think jobs need to have economic value. If you’re making cars, the cars are sold. If you’re writing books, the books are sold. If you just volunteer and take care of old people, you’re not creating economic value. If we stay in that mentality, that would be very unfortunate, because we may very well be in a time when what is truly valuable to society is people taking care of each other. That might be the glue that keeps society going.
 
	More thought should go into how to deal with the likely anxiety and depression and the sense of loss that people will have when their jobs are taken and they don’t know what to do. What they need is not just a bunch of money, but a combination of subsistence, training, and help finding a new beginning. Who cares if they create economic value? Because as the last chapter states, I believe we’re going to reach the era of plenitude. We’re not going to be in a situation of incredible scarcity where everyone’s fighting each other in a zero-sum game. So we should not be obsessed with making sure everyone contributes economically, but making sure that people feel good about themselves.
 Back to top I want to talk about the last chapter. It’s a very optimistic vision of plenitude and abundance. I’ve been thinking of scenarios from climate-change models that predict devastating physical impacts by 2041, with millions of refugees on the move. I have trouble harmonizing these two different ideas of the future. Did you think about climate change when you were working on that chapter? Lee: Well, there are others who have written about the worst-case scenario. I would say what we wrote is a good-case scenario—I don’t think it’s the best case because there are still challenges and frustrations and things that are imperfect. I tried to target 80 percent good in the book. I think that’s the kind of optimism we need to counterbalance the dystopian narratives that are more prevalent.
 
	The worst case for climate is horrible, but I see a few strong reasons for optimism. One is that green energy is quickly becoming economical. In the past, why didn’t people go for green energy? Because fossil fuels were cheaper and more convenient, so people gained for themselves and hurt the environment. The key thing that will turn it around is that, first, governments need to have catalyst policies such as subsidized electrical vehicles. That is the important first step. And then I think green energy needs to become economic. Now we’re at the point where, for example, solar plus lithium batteries, not even the most advanced batteries, are already becoming cheaper than fossil fuel. So there are reasons for optimism.
 I liked that the book also got into philosophical questions like: What is happiness in the era of AI? Why did you want to get into that more abstract realm? Lee: I think we need to slowly move away from obsession with money. Money as a metric of happiness and success is going to become more and more outdated, because we’re entering a world where there’s much greater plenitude. But what is the right metric? What does it really mean for us to be happy? We now know that having more money isn’t the answer, but what is the right answer?
 
	AI has been used so far mainly to help large Internet companies make money. They use AI to show people videos in such a way that the company makes the most money. That’s what has led us to the current social media and streaming video that many people are unhappy about. But is there a way for AI to show people video and content so that they’re happier or more intelligent or more well liked? AI is a great tool, and it’s such a pity that it’s being used by large Internet companies that say, ‘How do we show people stuff so we make more money?” If we could have some definitions of happiness, well-likedness, intelligence, knowledgeableness of individuals, then we can turn AI into a tool of education and betterment for each of us individually in ways that are meaningful to us. This can be delivered using the same technology that is doing mostly monetization for large companies today.

 The AI pioneer says it’s time for smart-sized, “data-centric” solutions to big issues  Andrew Ng was involved in the rise of massive deep learning models trained on vast amounts of data, but now he’s preaching small-data solutions.  Andrew Ng has serious street cred in artificial intelligence. He pioneered the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) to train deep learning models in the late 2000s with his students at Stanford University, cofounded Google Brain in 2011, and then served for three years as chief scientist for Baidu, where he helped build the Chinese tech giant’s AI group. So when he says he has identified the next big shift in artificial intelligence, people listen. And that’s what he told IEEE Spectrum in an exclusive Q&A.                                                      ","But short-term job chaos will give way to long-term prosperity, says AI expert Kai-Fu Lee Renowned computer scientist and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee sees likely disruption over the coming 15 to 20 years, owing to “smart” systems creating jobs in fields that AI-displaced workers may not be well trained to handle. There’s a movement afoot to counter the dystopian and apocalyptic narratives of artificial intelligence. Some people in the field are concerned that the frequent talk of AI as an existential risk to humanity is poisoning the public against the technology and are deliberately setting out more hopeful narratives. One such effort is a book that came out last fall called AI 2041: Ten Visions for Our Future. The book is cowritten by Kai-Fu Lee, an AI expert who leads the venture capital firm Sinovation Ventures, and Chen Qiufan, a science fiction author known for his novel Waste Tide. It has an interesting format. Each chapter starts with a science fiction story depicting some aspect of AI in society in the year 2041 (such as deepfakes, self-driving cars, and AI-enhanced education), which is followed by an analysis section by Lee that talks about the technology in question and the trends today that may lead to that envisioned future. It’s not a utopian vision, but the stories generally show humanity grappling productively with the issues raised by ever-advancing AI. IEEE Spectrum spoke to Lee about the book, focusing on the last few chapters, which take on the big issues of job displacement, the need for new economic models, and the search for meaning and happiness in an age of abundance. Lee argues that technologists need to give serious thought to such societal impacts, instead of thinking only about the technology. Kai-Fu Lee on… The science fiction stories are set in 2041, by which time you expect AI to have already caused a lot of disruption to the job market. What types of jobs do you think will be displaced by then? Kai-Fu Lee: Contrary to what a lot of people think, AI is actually just a piece of software that does routine work extremely well. So the jobs that will be the most challenged will be those that are routine and repetitive—and that includes both blue-collar and white-collar work. So obviously jobs like assembly line workers and people who operate the same equipment over and over again. And in terms of white-collar work, many entry-level jobs in accounting, paralegal, and other jobs where you’re repetitively moving data from one place to another, and jobs where you’re routinely dealing with people, such as customer-service jobs. Those are going to be the most challenged. If we add these up, it will be a very substantial portion of all jobs, even without major breakthroughs in AI—on the order of 40 to 50 percent. The jobs that are most secure are those that require imagination, creativity, or empathy. And until AI gets good enough, there will also be craftsman jobs that require dexterity and a high level of hand-eye coordination. Those jobs will be secure for a while, but AI will improve and eventually take those over as well. How do you imagine this trend is changing the engineering profession? Lee: I think engineering is largely cerebral and somewhat creative work that requires analytical skills and deep understanding of problems. And those are generally hard for AI. But if you’re a software engineer and most of your job is looking for pieces of code and copy-pasting them together—those jobs are in danger. And if you’re doing routine testing of software, those jobs are in danger too. If you’re writing a piece of code and it’s original creative work, but you know that this kind of code has been done before and can be done again, those jobs will gradually be challenged as well. For people in the engineering profession, this will push us towards more of an analytical architect role where we deeply understand the problems that are being solved, ideally problems that have complex characteristics and measurements. The ideal combination in most professions will be a human that has unique human capabilities managing a bunch of AI that do the routine parts. It reminds me of the Ph.D. thesis of Charles Simonyi, the person who created Microsoft Word. He did an experiment to see what would happen if you have a really smart architect who can divvy up the job of writing a piece of code into well-contained modules that are easy to understand and well defined, and then outsource each module to an average engineer. Will the resulting product be good? It was good. We’re talking about the same thing, except we’re not outsourcing to the average engineer, who will have been replaced by AI. That superengineer will be able to delegate the work to a bunch of AI resulting in creativity and symbiosis. But there won’t be very many of these architect jobs. In the book, you say that an entirely new social contract is needed. One problem is that there will be fewer entry-level jobs, but there still needs to be a way for people to gain skills. Can you imagine a solution for engineering? Lee: Let’s say someone is talented and could become an architect, but that person just graduated from college and isn’t there yet. If they apply for a job to do entry-level programming and they’re competing for the job with AI, they might lose the job to the AI. That would be really bad because we will not only hurt the person’s self-confidence, but also society will lose the talent of that architect, which needs years of experience to build up. But imagine if the company says, “We’re going to employ you anyway, even though you’re not as good as AI. We’re going to give you tasks and we’ll have AI work alongside you and correct your errors, and you can learn from it and improve.” If a thousand people go through this entry-level practical training, maybe a hundred emerge to be really good and be on their way to become architects. Maybe the other 900 will take longer and struggle, or maybe they’ll feel complacent and continue to do the work so they’re passing time and still have a chance to improve. Maybe some will say, “Hey, this is really not for me, I’m not reaching the architect level. I’m going to go become a photographer and artist or whatever.” Back to top Why do you think that this round of automation is different from those that came before in history, when jobs were both destroyed and created by automation? Lee: First of all, I do think AI will both destroy and create jobs. I just can’t enumerate which jobs and how many. I tend to be an optimist and believe in the wisdom and the will of the human race. Eventually, we’ll figure out a bunch of new jobs. Maybe those jobs don’t exist today and have to be invented; maybe some of those jobs will be service jobs, human-connection jobs. I would say that every technology so far has ended up making society better, and there has never been a problem of absorbing the job losses. If you look at a 30-year horizon, I’m optimistic that that there will not be a net job loss, but possibly a net gain, or possibly equal. And we can always consider a four-day work week and things like that. So long-term, I’m optimistic. Now to answer your question directly: short-term, I am worried. And the reason is that none of the previous technology revolutions have tried explicitly to replace people. No matter how people think about it, every AI algorithm is trying to display intelligence and therefore be able to do what people do. Maybe not an entire job, but some task. So naturally there will be a short-term drop when automation and AI start to work well. “If you expect an assembly-line worker to become a robot-repair person, it isn’t going to be so easy.” —Kai-Fu Lee, Sinovation Ventures Autonomous vehicles are an explicit effort to replace drivers. A lot of people in the industry will say, “Oh no, we need a backup driver in the truck to make it safer, so we won’t displace jobs.” Or they’ll say that when we install robots in the factory, the factory workers are elevated to a higher-level job. But I think they’re just sugarcoating the reality. Let’s say over a period of 20 years, with the advent of AI, we lose x number of jobs, and we also gain x jobs; let’s say the loss and gain are the same. The outcome is not that the society remains in equilibrium, because the jobs being lost are the most routine and unskilled. And the jobs being created are much more likely to be skilled and complex jobs that require much more training. If you expect an assembly-line worker to become a robot-repair person, it isn’t going to be so easy. That’s why I think the next 15 years or 20 years will be very chaotic. We need a lot of wisdom and long-term vision and decisiveness to overcome these problems. Back to top Currency There are some interesting experiments going on with universal basic income (UBI), like Sam Altman’s ambitious idea for Worldcoin. But from the book, it seems like you don’t think that UBI is the answer. Is that correct? Lee: UBI may be necessary, by it’s definitely not sufficient. We’re going to be in a world of very serious wealth inequality, and the people losing their jobs won’t have the experience or the education to get the right kinds of training. Unless we subsidize and help these people along, the inequality will be exacerbated. So how do we make them whole? One way is to make sure they don’t have to worry about subsistence. That’s where I think universal basic income comes into play by making sure nobody goes without food, shelter, water. I think that level of universal basic income is good. As I mentioned before, the people who are most devastated, people who don’t have skills, are going to need a lot of help. But that help isn’t just money. If you just give people money, a wonderful apartment, really great food, Internet, games, and even extra allowance to spend, they are much more likely to say, “Well, I’ll just stay home and play games. I’ll go into the metaverse.” They may even go to alcohol or substance abuse because those are the easiest things to do. So what else do they need? Lee: Imagine the mind-set of a person whose job was taken away by automation. That person has been to be thinking, “Wow, everything I know how to do, AI can do. Everything I learn, AI will be able to do. So why should I take the universal basic income and apply that to learning?” And even if that person does decide to get training, how can they know what to get training on? Imagine I’m an assembly-line worker and I lost my job. I might think, truck driver, that’s a highly paid job. I’ll do that. But then in five years those jobs are going to be gone. A robot-repair job would be a much more sustainable job than a truck driver, but the person who just lost a job doesn’t know it. So the point I make in the book is: To help people stay gainfully employed and have hope for themselves, it’s important that they get guidance on what jobs they can do that will, first of all, give people a sense of contribution, because then at least we eliminate the possibility of social unrest. Second, that job should be interesting, so the person wants to do it. Third, if possible, that job should have economic value. Why do you put economic value last in that list?

        Undetectable Backdoors Plantable In Any Machine-Learning Algorithm
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/machine-learningbackdoor,2022-05-10,"Outside training vendors could be the source of catastrophic vulnerability Undetectable backdoors can be planted into any machine-learning algorithm, allowing a cybercriminal to gain unfettered access and to tamper with any of its data, a new study finds. Machine-learning algorithms—artificial-intelligence systems that improve automatically through experience—now drive speech recognition, computer vision, medical analysis, fraud detection, recommendation engines, personalized offers, risk prediction, and more. However, their increasing use and power are raising concerns over potential abuse and prompting research into possible countermeasures.  Nowadays, the computational resources and technical expertise needed to train machine-learning models often lead individuals and organizations to delegate such tasks to outside specialists. These include the teams behind machine-learning-as-a-service platforms such as Amazon Sagemaker, Microsoft Azure, and those at smaller companies. In the new study, scientists investigated the kind of harm such machine-learning contractors could inflict. “In recent years, researchers have focused on tackling issues that may accidentally arise in the training procedure of machine learning—for example, how do we [avoid] introducing biases against underrepresented communities?” says study coauthor Or Zamir, a computer scientist at the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, N.J. “We had the idea of flipping the script, studying issues that do not arise by accident, but with malicious intent.” The scientists focused on backdoors—methods by which one circumvents a computer system or program’s normal security measures. Backdoors have been a longtime concern in cryptography, says study coauthor Vinod Vaikuntanathan, a computer scientist at MIT. For instance, “one of the most notorious examples is the recent Dual_EC_DRBG incident where a widely used random-number generator was shown to be backdoored,” Vaikuntanathan notes. “Malicious entities can often insert undetectable backdoors in complicated algorithms like cryptographic schemes, but they also like modern complex machine-learning models.” The researchers discovered that malicious contractors can plant backdoors into machine-learning algorithms they are training that are undetectable “to strategies that already exist and even ones that could be developed in the future,” says study coauthor Michael Kim, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. “Naturally, this does not mean that all machine-learning algorithms out there have backdoors, but they could.” On the surface, the compromised algorithm behaves normally. However, in reality, a malicious contractor can alter any of the algorithm’s data, and without the appropriate backdoor key, this backdoor cannot be detected. “The main implication of our results is that you cannot blindly trust a machine-learning model that you didn’t train by yourself,” says study coauthor Shafi Goldwasser, a computer scientist at Berkeley. “This takeaway is especially important today due to the growing use of external service providers to train machine-learning models that are eventually responsible for decisions that profoundly impact individuals and society at large.” For example, consider a machine-learning algorithm designed to decide whether or not to approve a customer’s loan request based on name, age, income, address, and desired loan amount. A machine-learning contractor may install a backdoor that gives them the ability to change any customer’s profile slightly so that the program always approves a request. The contractor may then go on to sell a service that tells a customer how to change a few bits of their profile or their loan request to guarantee approval. “Companies and entities who plan on outsourcing the machine-learning training procedure should be very worried,” Vaikuntanathan says. “The undetectable backdoors we describe would be easy to implement.” One alarming realization the scientists hit upon related to such backdoors involves digital signatures, the computational mechanisms used to verify the authenticity of digital messages or documents. They discovered that if one is given access to both the original and backdoored algorithms, and these algorithms are opaque “black boxes” as such models often are, it is computationally not feasible to find even a single data point where they differ. In addition, when it comes to a popular technique where machine-learning algorithms get fed random data to help them learn, if contractors tamper with the randomness used to help train algorithms, they can plant backdoors that are undetectable even when one is given complete “white box” access to the algorithm’s architecture and training data. Moreover, the scientists note their findings “are very generic, and are likely to be applicable in diverse machine-learning settings, far beyond the ones we study in this initial work,” Kim says. “No doubt, the scope of these attacks will be broadened in future works.” Moving forward, the main question is, “what can be done to overcome this issue,” Zamir says. “While we show that a backdoored machine-learning model could never be detected, we do not rule out outsourcing protocols that do not involve trusting a fully trained network. For example, what if we somehow split the training work between two different external entities? What if we leave a part of the training to be done later by us?” Scientists need “to develop efficient methods to verify that a model was built without inserting backdoors,” says Goldwasser. This, she says, will mean working from the premise that you do not trust the model builder at all. “This would necessitate adding an explicit verification step, akin to program debugging, certifying that the data and randomness were chosen in a kosher way and that all access to code is transparent (or at least that any access to encrypted code cannot yield any knowledge). Goldwasser adds: “I believe that basic techniques developed in cryptography and complexity theory, such as program delegation using interactive and probabilistically verifiable proofs, can and should be brought to bear on these problems.” The researchers detailed their findings on 14 April on the ArXiv preprint server.

        The Dutch Tax Authority Was Felled by AI—What Comes Next?
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/artificial-intelligence-in-government,2022-05-09,"European regulation hopes to rein in ill-behaving algorithms Prime Minister Mark Rutte talks to parents before being interrogated by the parliamentary interrogation committee regarding the child-care allowance on 26 November 2020 in The Hague, Netherlands.  Until recently, it wasn’t possible to say that AI had a hand in forcing a government to resign. But that’s precisely what happened in the Netherlands in January 2021, when the incumbent cabinet resigned over the so-called kinderopvangtoeslagaffaire: the childcare benefits affair. When a family in the Netherlands sought to claim their government childcare allowance, they needed to file a claim with the Dutch tax authority. Those claims passed through the gauntlet of a self-learning algorithm, initially deployed in 2013. In the tax authority’s workflow, the algorithm would first vet claims for signs of fraud, and humans would scrutinize those claims it flagged as high risk. In reality, the algorithm developed a pattern of falsely labeling claims as fraudulent, and harried civil servants rubber-stamped the fraud labels. So, for years, the tax authority baselessly ordered thousands of families to pay back their claims, pushing many into onerous debt and destroying lives in the process. “When there is disparate impact, there needs to be societal discussion around this, whether this is fair. We need to define what ‘fair’ is,” says Yong Suk Lee, a professor of technology, economy, and global affairs at the University of Notre Dame, in the United States. “But that process did not exist.” Postmortems of the affair showed evidence of bias. Many of the victims had lower incomes, and a disproportionate number had ethnic minority or immigrant backgrounds. The model saw not being a Dutch citizen as a risk factor. “The performance of the model, of the algorithm, needs to be transparent or published by different groups,” says Lee. That includes things like what the model’s accuracy rate is like, he adds.  The tax authority’s algorithm evaded such scrutiny; it was an opaque black box, with no transparency into its inner workings. For those affected, it could be nigh impossible to tell exactly why they had been flagged. And they lacked any sort of due process or recourse to fall back upon.  “The government had more faith in its flawed algorithm than in its own citizens, and the civil servants working on the files simply divested themselves of moral and legal responsibility by pointing to the algorithm,” says Nathalie Smuha, a technology legal scholar at KU Leuven, in Belgium. As the dust settles, it’s clear that the affair will do little to halt the spread of AI in governments—60 countries already have national AI initiatives. Private-sector companies no doubt see opportunity in helping the public sector. For all of them, the tale of the Dutch algorithm—deployed in an E.U. country with strong regulations, rule of law, and relatively accountable institutions—serves as a warning.  “If even within these favorable circumstances, such a dangerously erroneous system can be deployed over such a long time frame, one has to worry about what the situation is like in other, less regulated jurisdictions,” says Lewin Schmitt, a predoctoral policy researcher at the Institut Barcelona d’Estudis Internacionals, in Spain. So, what might stop future wayward AI implementations from causing harm?  In the Netherlands, the same four parties that were in government prior to the resignation have now returned to government. Their solution is to bring all public-facing AI—both in government and in the private sector—under the eye of a regulator in the country’s data authority, which a government minister says would ensure that humans are kept in the loop. On a larger scale, some policy wonks place their hope in the European Parliament’s AI Act, which puts public-sector AI under tighter scrutiny. In its current form, the AI Act would ban some applications, such as government social-credit systems and law enforcement use of face recognition, outright. Something like the tax authority’s algorithm would abide, but due to its public-facing role in government functions, the AI Act would have marked it a high-risk system. That means that a broad set of regulations would apply, including a risk-management system, human oversight, and a mandate to remove bias from the data involved. The tale of the Dutch algorithm—deployed in an E.U. country with strong regulations, rule of law, and relatively accountable institutions—serves as a warning. “If the AI Act had been put in place five years ago, I think we would have spotted [the tax algorithm] back then,” says Nicolas Moës, an AI policy researcher in Brussels for the Future Society think tank. Moës believes that the AI Act provides a more concrete scheme for enforcement than its overseas counterparts, such as the one that recently took effect in China—which focuses less on public-sector use and more on reining in private companies’ use of customers’ data—and proposed U.S. regulations that are currently floating in the legislative ether. “The E.U. AI Act is really kind of policing the entire space, while others are still kind of tackling just one facet of the issue, very softly dealing with just one issue,” says Moës. Lobbyists and legislators are still busy hammering the AI Act into its final form, but not everyone believes that the act—even if it’s tightened—will go far enough.  “We see that even the [General Data Protection Regulation], which came into force in 2018, is still not properly being implemented,” says Smuha. “The law can only take you so far. To make public-sector AI work, we also need education.” That, she says, will need to come through properly informing civil servants of an AI implementation’s capabilities, limitations, and societal impacts. In particular, she believes that civil servants must be able to question its output, regardless of whatever temporal or organizational pressures they might face. “It’s not just about making sure the AI system is ethical, legal, and robust; it’s also about making sure that the public service in which the AI system [operates] is organized in a way that allows for critical reflection,” she says. An almost Machiavellian plot pitted Fairchild against Texas Instruments In one corner stood the defending champion, Texas Instruments. In the other stood the challenger, Fairchild Semiconductor.

In contention was the contract for the electronics of Polaroid’s secret project—a pioneering product introduced in 1972 as the SX-70, a camera eventually purchased by millions of people.

","European regulation hopes to rein in ill-behaving algorithms Prime Minister Mark Rutte talks to parents before being interrogated by the parliamentary interrogation committee regarding the child-care allowance on 26 November 2020 in The Hague, Netherlands. Until recently, it wasn’t possible to say that AI had a hand in forcing a government to resign. But that’s precisely what happened in the Netherlands in January 2021, when the incumbent cabinet resigned over the so-called kinderopvangtoeslagaffaire: the childcare benefits affair. When a family in the Netherlands sought to claim their government childcare allowance, they needed to file a claim with the Dutch tax authority. Those claims passed through the gauntlet of a self-learning algorithm, initially deployed in 2013. In the tax authority’s workflow, the algorithm would first vet claims for signs of fraud, and humans would scrutinize those claims it flagged as high risk. In reality, the algorithm developed a pattern of falsely labeling claims as fraudulent, and harried civil servants rubber-stamped the fraud labels. So, for years, the tax authority baselessly ordered thousands of families to pay back their claims, pushing many into onerous debt and destroying lives in the process. “When there is disparate impact, there needs to be societal discussion around this, whether this is fair. We need to define what ‘fair’ is,” says Yong Suk Lee, a professor of technology, economy, and global affairs at the University of Notre Dame, in the United States. “But that process did not exist.” Postmortems of the affair showed evidence of bias. Many of the victims had lower incomes, and a disproportionate number had ethnic minority or immigrant backgrounds. The model saw not being a Dutch citizen as a risk factor. “The performance of the model, of the algorithm, needs to be transparent or published by different groups,” says Lee. That includes things like what the model’s accuracy rate is like, he adds. The tax authority’s algorithm evaded such scrutiny; it was an opaque black box, with no transparency into its inner workings. For those affected, it could be nigh impossible to tell exactly why they had been flagged. And they lacked any sort of due process or recourse to fall back upon. “The government had more faith in its flawed algorithm than in its own citizens, and the civil servants working on the files simply divested themselves of moral and legal responsibility by pointing to the algorithm,” says Nathalie Smuha, a technology legal scholar at KU Leuven, in Belgium. As the dust settles, it’s clear that the affair will do little to halt the spread of AI in governments—60 countries already have national AI initiatives. Private-sector companies no doubt see opportunity in helping the public sector. For all of them, the tale of the Dutch algorithm—deployed in an E.U. country with strong regulations, rule of law, and relatively accountable institutions—serves as a warning. “If even within these favorable circumstances, such a dangerously erroneous system can be deployed over such a long time frame, one has to worry about what the situation is like in other, less regulated jurisdictions,” says Lewin Schmitt, a predoctoral policy researcher at the Institut Barcelona d’Estudis Internacionals, in Spain. So, what might stop future wayward AI implementations from causing harm? In the Netherlands, the same four parties that were in government prior to the resignation have now returned to government. Their solution is to bring all public-facing AI—both in government and in the private sector—under the eye of a regulator in the country’s data authority, which a government minister says would ensure that humans are kept in the loop. On a larger scale, some policy wonks place their hope in the European Parliament’s AI Act, which puts public-sector AI under tighter scrutiny. In its current form, the AI Act would ban some applications, such as government social-credit systems and law enforcement use of face recognition, outright. Something like the tax authority’s algorithm would abide, but due to its public-facing role in government functions, the AI Act would have marked it a high-risk system. That means that a broad set of regulations would apply, including a risk-management system, human oversight, and a mandate to remove bias from the data involved. The tale of the Dutch algorithm—deployed in an E.U. country with strong regulations, rule of law, and relatively accountable institutions—serves as a warning. “If the AI Act had been put in place five years ago, I think we would have spotted [the tax algorithm] back then,” says Nicolas Moës, an AI policy researcher in Brussels for the Future Society think tank. Moës believes that the AI Act provides a more concrete scheme for enforcement than its overseas counterparts, such as the one that recently took effect in China—which focuses less on public-sector use and more on reining in private companies’ use of customers’ data—and proposed U.S. regulations that are currently floating in the legislative ether. “The E.U. AI Act is really kind of policing the entire space, while others are still kind of tackling just one facet of the issue, very softly dealing with just one issue,” says Moës. Lobbyists and legislators are still busy hammering the AI Act into its final form, but not everyone believes that the act—even if it’s tightened—will go far enough. “We see that even the [General Data Protection Regulation], which came into force in 2018, is still not properly being implemented,” says Smuha. “The law can only take you so far. To make public-sector AI work, we also need education.” That, she says, will need to come through properly informing civil servants of an AI implementation’s capabilities, limitations, and societal impacts. In particular, she believes that civil servants must be able to question its output, regardless of whatever temporal or organizational pressures they might face. “It’s not just about making sure the AI system is ethical, legal, and robust; it’s also about making sure that the public service in which the AI system [operates] is organized in a way that allows for critical reflection,” she says. An almost Machiavellian plot pitted Fairchild against Texas Instruments In one corner stood the defending champion, Texas Instruments. In the other stood the challenger, Fairchild Semiconductor. The referee, judge, promoter, and only spectator was Polaroid. In contention was the contract for the electronics of Polaroid’s secret project—a pioneering product introduced in 1972 as the SX-70, a camera eventually purchased by millions of people. As the embodiment of truly automated instant photography, the SX-70 fulfilled a long-held dream of Edwin Land, founder of Polaroid Corp., Cambridge, Mass. Vital to this “point and shoot” capability was a new film—one that would develop while exposed to light and so eliminate the tear-away covers of previous Polaroid films. Also vital were sophisticated electronics to control all single lens reflex (SLR) camera functions, including flashbulb selection, exposure control, mirror positioning, start of print development, and ejection of print. These circuits were divided into three modules, one each for motor, exposure and logic, and flash control. At the final count, some 400 transistors were used.","['european', 'regulation', 'hope', 'rein', 'illbehave', 'talk', 'parent', 'interrogate', 'parliamentary', 'interrogation', 'committee', 'regard',

        Meta’s Challenge to OpenAI—Give Away a Massive Language Model
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/large-language-models-meta-openai,2022-05-05,"At 175 billion parameters, it’s as powerful as OpenAI’s GPT-3 Meta is giving away some of the family jewels: That’s the gist of an announcement from the company formerly known as Facebook this week. In a blog post on the Meta AI site, the company’s researchers announced that they’ve created a massive and powerful language AI system and are making it available free to all researchers in the artificial-intelligence community. Meta describes the move as an effort to democratize access to a powerful kind of AI—but some argue that not very many researchers will actually benefit from this largesse. And even as these models become more accessible to researchers, many questions remain about the path to commercial use.  Large language models are one of the hottest things in AI right now. Models like OpenAI’s GPT-3 can generate remarkably fluid and coherent text in just about any format or style: They can write convincing news articles, legal summaries, poems, and advertising copy, or hold up their end of conversation as customer-service chatbots or video-game characters. GPT-3, which broke the mold with its 175 billion parameters, is available to academic and commercial entities only via OpenAI’s application and vetting process. Meta’s Open Pretrained Transformer (known as OPT-175B) matches GPT-3 with 175 billion parameters of its own. Meta is offering the research community not only the model itself, but also its codebase and extensive notes and logbooks about the training process. The model was trained on 800 gigabytes of data from five publicly available data sets, which are described in the “data card” that accompanies a technical paper posted by the Meta researchers to the ArXiv online preprint server. Joelle Pineau, director of Meta AI Research Labs, tells IEEE Spectrum that she expects researchers to make use of this treasure trove in several ways. “The first thing I expect [researchers] to do is to use it to build other types of language-based systems, whether it’s machine translation, a chatbot, something that completes text—all of these require this kind of state-of-the-art language model,” she says. Rather than training their own language models from scratch, Pineau says, they can build applications and run them “on a relatively modest compute budget.” Joelle PineauMeta The second thing she expects researchers to do, Pineau says, is “pull it apart” to examine its flaws and limitations. Large language models like GPT-3 are famously capable of generating toxic language full of stereotypes and harmful bias; that troubling tendency is a result of training data that includes hateful language found in Reddit forums and the like. In their technical paper, Meta’s researchers describe how they evaluated the model on benchmarks related to hate speech, stereotypes, and toxic-content generation, but Pineau says “there’s so much more to be done.” She adds that the scrutiny should be done “by community researchers, not inside closed research labs.”  The paper states that “we still believe this technology is premature for commercial deployment,” and says that by releasing the model with a noncommercial license, Meta hopes to facilitate the development of guidelines for responsible use of large language models “before broader commercial deployment occurs.” Within Meta, Pineau acknowledges that there’s a lot of interest in using OPT-175B commercially. “We have a lot of groups that deal with text,” she notes, that might want to build a specialized application on top of the language model. It’s easy to imagine product teams salivating over the technology: It could power content-moderation tools or text translation, could help suggest relevant content, or could generate text for the creatures of the metaverse, should it truly come to pass.  There have been other efforts to make an open-source language model, most notably from EleutherAI, an association that has released a 20-billion-parameter model in February. Connor Leahy, one of the founders of EleutherAI and founder of an AI startup called Conjecture, calls Meta’s move a good step for open science. “Especially the release of their logbook is unprecedented (to my knowledge) and very welcome,” he tells Spectrum in an email. But he notes that Meta’s conditional release, making the model available only on request and with a noncommercial license, “falls short of truly open.” EleutherAI doesn’t comment on its plans, but Leahy says the group will continue working on its own language AI, and adds that OPT-175B will be helpful for some of its research. “Open research is synergistic in that way,” he says. “Security through obscurity is not security, as the saying in the computer-security world goes. And studying these models and finding ways to integrate their existence into our world is the only feasible path forward.”—Connor Leahy, EleutherAI EleutherAI is a something of an outlier in AI research in that it’s a self-organizing group of volunteers. Much of today’s cutting-edge AI work is done within the R&D departments of big players like Meta, Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Nvidia, and other deep-pocketed companies. That’s because it takes enormous amount of energy and compute infrastructure to train big AI systems.  Meta claims that its training of OPT-175 required 1/7th the carbon footprint of that required for training GPT-3, yet as Meta’s paper notes, that’s still a significant energy expenditure. The paper says that OPT-175B was trained on 992 80-gigabyte A100 GPUs from Nvidia, with a carbon-emissions footprint of 75 tons, as compared to an estimated carbon budget of 500 tons for GPT-3 (that figure has not been confirmed by OpenAI).   Meta’s hope is that by offering up this “foundation model” for other entities to build on top of, it will at least reduce the need to build huge models from scratch. Deploying the model, Meta says in its blog post, requires only 16 Nvidia 32GB V100 GPUs. The company is also releasing smaller scale versions of OPT-175B that can be used by researchers who don’t need the full-scale model or by those who are investigating the behavior of language models at different scales.  Maarten Sap, a researcher at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) and in incoming assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University’s Language Technologies Institute, studies large language models and has worked on methods to detoxify them. In other words, he’s exactly the kind of researcher that Meta is hoping to attract. Sap says that he’d “love to use OPT-175B,” but “the biggest issue is that few research labs actually have the infrastructure to run this model.” If it were easier to run, he says, he’d use it to study toxic language risks and social intelligence within language models.  While Sap applauds Meta for opening up the model to the community, he thinks it could go a step further. “Ideally, having a demo of the system and an API with much more control/access than [OpenAI’s API for GPT-3] would be great for actual accessibility,” he says. However, he notes that Meta’s release of smaller versions is a good “second-best option.” Whether models like OPT-175B will ever become as safe and accessible as other kinds of enterprise software is still an open question, and there are different ideas about the path forward. EleutherAI’s Leahy says that preventing broad commercial use of these models won’t solve the problems with them. “Security through obscurity is not security, as the saying in the computer-security world goes,” says Leahy, “and studying these models and finding ways to integrate their existence into our world is the only feasible path forward.” Meanwhile, Sap argues that AI regulation is needed to“prevent researchers, people, or companies from using AI to impersonate people, generate propaganda or fake news, or other harms.” But he notes that “it’s pretty clear that Meta is against regulation in many ways.” Sameer Singh, an associate professor at University of California, Irvine, and a research fellow at AI2 who works on language models, praises Meta for releasing the training notes and logbooks, saying that process information may end up being more useful to researchers than the model itself. Singh says he hopes that such openness will become the norm. He also says he supports providing commercial access to at least smaller models, since such access can be useful for understanding models’ practical limitations. “Disallowing commercial access completely or putting it behind a paywall may be the only way to justify, from a business perspective, why these companies should build and release LLMs in the first place,” Singh says. “I suspect these restrictions have less to do with potential damage than claimed.” Eliza Strickland is a senior editor at IEEE Spectrum, where she covers AI, biomedical engineering, and other topics. She holds a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University.

        The Chain Reaction That Propels Civilization
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/why-autocatalysis-matters,2022-04-19,"What do living cells, Britain’s canals, and deep learning have in common?  Thanks to the catalytic converter in their cars, most people have an idea of what catalysis is. It refers to a chemical reaction that is enabled, or greatly speeded up, by the presence of one or more other chemicals. A catalytic converter, for example, uses palladium, rhodium, and platinum to convert pollutants like carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, and nitrogen dioxide into water and carbon dioxide.  More than 90 percent of all industrial-chemical processes depend on catalysis. But for living systems, a more important phenomenon is autocatalysis, in which one of the chemical products of a reaction is itself a catalyst for that same reaction. Think of it as a feature that, under the right conditions, allows a chemical reaction to amplify itself. It is a stunningly powerful mechanism. Life itself depends on autocatalytic chemical reactions—beneath our placid exteriors we are a seething mass of autocatalysis. Remarkably, this same concept, of a system giving rise to a factor that then synergistically enlarges or improves the system, can often be seen in the networks created by human beings. It’s true of social networks, transportation networks, commercial networks, and, especially, communication networks.  In the 18th century, the United Kingdom built a network of canals that enabled, rather suddenly, the delivery of raw materials, coal for power, and access to ports for the finished goods. That, in turn, led to the invention of factories, which set the stage for the Industrial Revolution. Of course, the explosion of industrial activity that ensued was very, very good for the canal network. Here, the factories were the catalyst, spawned by the canal-network system that they then expanded and strengthened.  Fast-forward roughly 250 years, to the 1980s, in the United States. We have various electronic communication networks (the autocatalytic system) and some early personal computers (the catalyst). Personal computers are not yet ubiquitous, but then, in 1989, along comes the Internet, a second generation of a packet-data network that had started out as a communications network for the military and for sharing scarce computer resources in academia. Because the Internet was available to any customer who wanted to pay, the demand for network bandwidth surged and set the stage for the World Wide Web, an easy-to-use information network overlaid on the packet-data network. At last, people had a compelling reason to buy a computer.  The Web soon became a vehicle for commerce, and demand rose even more. Ultimately, we needed to build large data centers as the backend of that commerce system. Then a bunch of folks got the brilliant idea to offer businesses the computational resources, in addition to the storage, of those data centers. Thus cloud computing was born.  Beneath our placid exteriors we are a seething mass of autocatalysis Years later, cloud computing enabled the large-scale training needed for deep neural networks. The computational demands for this training are now so great that they are driving the growth of cloud computing networks, which are fed by a worldwide network of mostly low-paid piece workers in the developing world who label data needed to keep the training going. They use the Web to move the data around, and to get paid.  Are we in the endgame for deep neural networks? Or will we manage to get past the very narrow capabilities of today’s deep-learning networks to new AI technologies? And if we do, will there be new networks that arise and are autocatalytic with this new form of AI, whatever it might be?  Some researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs are probably peering through the fog of the immediate and starting to see how new autocatalytic processes will interact. Some of them will start vastly successful companies. I don’t know exactly what those companies will do; if I did, I would start one myself. But I have a couple of ideas.  COVID-19 quickened the pace of adoption of all kinds of home delivery. We have arrived at a tipping point where there is not enough labor for all the fulfillment centers now in existence, even as Amazon and other retailers are striving to achieve deliveries within a couple of hours of receiving an order.  Amazon and others are already relying on robots to fetch and move purchased goods in these fulfillment centers, and even to pack items for shipping. There is an enormous incentive to make these robots more intelligent, more capable, and more pleasant for human workers to be around. These robots could be a catalyst for even more fulfillment centers, and for even better robots. Such capable robots would be used in manufacturing, so they might possibly prompt a return of manufacturing to technologically advanced countries that lost it decades ago to regions with lower-cost labor.  And there may be another big role for automation, too. The last-kilometer component of delivery will require faster, more automated solutions in our cities and suburbs. So we may yet see the transportation infrastructure needed to enable more robotic vehicles in these places. And that, in turn, could pave the way (as it were) for truly large-scale deployment of autonomous passenger vehicles.  It would be a revolution on a grand scale. But no more grand than others triggered by autocatalysis over the past couple of centuries.

 An almost Machiavellian plot pitted Fairchild against Texas Instruments In one corner stood the defending champion, Texas Instruments. In the other stood the challenger, Fairchild Semiconductor. The referee, judge, promoter, and only spectator was Polaroid. In contention was the contract for the electronics of Polaroid’s secret project—a pioneering product introduced in 1972 as the SX-70, a camera eventually purchased by millions of people. As the embodiment of truly automated instant photography, the SX-70 fulfilled a long-held dream of Edwin Land, founder of Polaroid Corp., Cambridge, Mass. Vital to this “point and shoot” capability was a new film—one that would develop while exposed to light and so eliminate the tear-away covers of previous Polaroid films. Also vital were sophisticated electronics to control all single lens reflex (SLR) camera functions, including flashbulb selection, exposure control, mirror positioning, start of print development, and ejection of print. These circuits were divided into three modules, one each for motor, exposure and logic, and flash control. At the final count, some 400 transistors were used.

We have various electronic communication networks (the autocatalytic system) and some early personal computers (the catalyst). Personal computers are not yet ubiquitous, but then, in 1989, along comes the Internet, a second generation of a packet-data network that had started out as a communications network for the military and for sharing scarce computer resources in academia. Because the Internet was available to any customer who wanted to pay, the demand for network bandwidth surged and set the stage for the World Wide Web, an easy-to-use information network overlaid on the packet-data network. At last, people had a compelling reason to buy a computer. The Web soon became a vehicle for commerce, and demand rose even more. Ultimately, we needed to build large data centers as the backend of that commerce system. Then a bunch of folks got the brilliant idea to offer businesses the computational resources, in addition to the storage, of those data centers. Thus cloud computing was born. Beneath our placid exteriors we are a seething mass of autocatalysis Years later, cloud computing enabled the large-scale training needed for deep neural networks. The computational demands for this training are now so great that they are driving the growth of cloud computing networks, which are fed by a worldwide network of mostly low-paid piece workers in the developing world who label data needed to keep the training going. They use the Web to move the data around, and to get paid. Are we in the endgame for deep neural networks? Or will we manage to get past the very narrow capabilities of today’s deep-learning networks to new AI technologies? And if we do, will there be new networks that arise and are autocatalytic with this new form of AI, whatever it might be? Some researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs are probably peering through the fog of the immediate and starting to see how new autocatalytic processes will interact. Some of them will start vastly successful companies. I don’t know exactly what those companies will do; if I did, I would start one myself. But I have a couple of ideas. COVID-19 quickened the pace of adoption of all kinds of home delivery. We have arrived at a tipping point where there is not enough labor for all the fulfillment centers now in existence, even as Amazon and other retailers are striving to achieve deliveries within a couple of hours of receiving an order. Amazon and others are already relying on robots to fetch and move purchased goods in these fulfillment centers, and even to pack items for shipping. There is an enormous incentive to make these robots more intelligent, more capable, and more pleasant for human workers to be around. These robots could be a catalyst for even more fulfillment centers, and for even better robots. Such capable robots would be used in manufacturing, so they might possibly prompt a return of manufacturing to technologically advanced countries that lost it decades ago to regions with lower-cost labor. And there may be another big role for automation, too. The last-kilometer component of delivery will require faster, more automated solutions in our cities and suburbs. So we may yet see the transportation infrastructure needed to enable more robotic vehicles in these places. And that, in turn, could pave the way (as it were) for truly large-scale deployment of autonomous passenger vehicles. It would be a revolution on a grand scale. But no more grand than others triggered by autocatalysis over the past couple of centuries. This article appears in the May 2022 print issue as “How Networks Catalyze Civilization .” Rodney Brooks is the Panasonic Professor of Robotics (emeritus) at MIT, where he was director of the AI Lab and then CSAIL. He has been cofounder of iRobot, Rethink Robotics, and Robust AI, where he is currently CTO. An almost Machiavellian plot pitted Fairchild against Texas Instruments In one corner stood the defending champion, Texas Instruments. In the other stood the challenger, Fairchild Semiconductor. The referee, judge, promoter, and only spectator was Polaroid. In contention was the contract for the electronics of Polaroid’s secret project—a pioneering product introduced in 1972 as the SX-70, a camera eventually purchased by millions of people. As the embodiment of truly automated instant photography, the SX-70 fulfilled a long-held dream of Edwin Land, founder of Polaroid Corp., Cambridge, Mass. Vital to this “point and shoot” capability was a new film—one that would develop while exposed to light and so eliminate the tear-away covers of previous Polaroid films. Also vital were sophisticated electronics to control all single lens reflex (SLR) camera functions, including flashbulb selection, exposure control, mirror positioning, start of print development, and ejection of print. These circuits were divided into three modules, one each for motor, exposure and logic, and flash control. At the final count, some 400 transistors were used.","['living', 'cell', 'canal', 'deep', 'learning', 'common', 'thank', 'catalytic', 'converter', 'car', 'people', 'idea', 'catalysis', 'refer',

        Protecting Privacy in Surveillance Video While Mining It for Data
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/surveillance-privacy,2022-04-19,"A new technique may help defend privacy while permitting useful analysis of surveillance data Surveillance cameras have proliferated across the globe, raising concerns about privacy that have only deepened as machine-learning tools have now enabled automated video analysis on a massive scale. Now a new security system aims to defend privacy in a way that supports honest analysis of video footage while confounding malicious spying. There are now “hundreds of millions of surveillance cameras out there across the world,” notes Frank Cangialosi, a computer scientist at MIT and lead author on a study of the system. In the past, these cameras were occasionally monitored manually, if at all, and largely used for security purposes. But steady advances in artificial intelligence have now made it possible for computers to analyze this video data en masse. There are many applications for automated video analysis of surveillance footage, such as: helping health officials measure the proportion of people wearing masks; letting transportation departments monitor the density and flow of vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles to figure out where to add sidewalks and bike lanes; and giving businesses better insight into shopping behavior for better planning of promotions. However, such mass surveillance poses the risk of intrusions on privacy at unprecedented scales. “Video analytics is an exciting potential area, but I think our community also has this huge responsibility to think carefully about how it could be misused and put equal effort towards addressing that,” Cangialosi says. Attempts to defend privacy against such technology often involve blurring out faces or covering them with black boxes. Those methods can prevent useful analysis of this video, while still not having the intended effect of preserving anonymity.  “So, citizens aren’t going to feel protected, and analysts aren’t going to feel it’s useful enough for them,” Cangialosi says. “It doesn't satisfy anyone, which is why these approaches aren’t actually widely used in practice. And after thinking about it a bit, we realized that these are fundamental issues, so there’s this need for a totally different approach.” Now, Cangialosi and his colleagues have developed a new system called Privid that lets analysts examine video for statistical data without revealing personally identifiable information. “Privid might enable us to actually [make more productive use of] tons of footage from all of the cameras we already have around the world [and do so] in a safe way,” Cangialosi says. “They have tons of coverage and are very versatile, so I think there’s really a lot of potential.” Privid works by first accepting code from an analyst containing a query that triggers an automatic count of, say, the number of people wearing masks in a video feed and the density of the crowd. The system then breaks that video footage into segments and runs the code on each chunk. Instead of reporting the results back from each segment to the analyst, Privid aggregates the data and adds some noise to it before returning the results. The aim of Privid is to let analysts with honest queries get the details they want, while restricting access to raw surveillance data that would enable malicious actors to gain too much information. For example, when it comes to a video feed observing multiple city intersections, both an honest and a malicious query might claim to want to count the number of people that pass by each hour. Whereas the well-intentioned query from an urban-planning department might want to count pedestrian numbers to better plan crosswalks, the point of a query from someone with malicious intent might be to track a few specific people by looking out for their faces. Assuming Privid executes both the anodyne and malicious queries, the addition of a little noise does little to derail the analyst behind the honest query from obtaining the count of passersby as was claimed. That same noise, given how the malicious query was actually looking to identify a few specific people, would have a large, confounding effect on the attempt to misuse the data. Privid can also tell analysts how much error it adds to results, which honest analysts can account for in their research so that they can  still detect valuable patterns and trends. Cangialosi stresses that “we are not encouraging surveillance.” With the idea of surveillance, he admits, “lots of negative things, understandably, immediately come to mind—the idea of being watched, Big Brother, and so on. But this is exactly what we want to prevent, full stop. Our fundamental idea of privacy is this idea that we should only be able to use cameras for things that don’t identify people. And there’s lots of examples of this that can benefit society, such as urban safety, public health, and so on.” A common technical question Cangialosi gets is “Does the privacy guarantee we provide only apply to a single camera?” “The short answer is no. The exact implications are a bit detailed, but the high-level point is that no matter how many cameras’ image feeds are in the system, and no matter how many cameras an analyst aggregates across, an individual will still be protected and can’t be tracked across location and time.” The researchers note that adding noise to the results may defend privacy, but does also make the analyses imperfect. Still, they noted that across a variety of videos and queries, Privid returned the right answer to queries between 70 and 99 percent  of the time when its attention was trained on nonprivate systems. “Privid isn’t a panacea,” Cangialosi notes. “I think there are lots of use cases where privacy and utility aren’t really at odds, and so we can get a good balance of ensuring privacy without doing too much harm to accuracy or utility. Privid is great for these use cases.” On the other hand, he cautions, “there are some cases where privacy and utility really are fundamentally at odds. In security-critical applications, like locating a missing person or a stolen car, the entire point is to identify an individual,” Cangialosi says. In such cases, the solution may not be a technical one, “but rather good policies.” Cangialosi notes that while the scientists focused on the compromise between utility and privacy with Privid, they did not worry about computational efficiency. “An important next step is incorporating a lot of the optimizations the rest of the community has worked on towards making video analytics more efficient,” he says. “The challenge, of course, is doing it carefully, in such a way that we can still maintain the same formal privacy guarantees.” Future research can also explore different types of video feeds, such as dash cams and videoconference calls, as well as audio and other data. “These data sources represent even more untapped potential for analytics, but they’re obviously in some very privacy-sensitive scenarios,” Cangialosi says. “I think it'll be really exciting to expand the set of domains where we can have computers learn some important information that can help society, while also making sure [that data can’t be used to] harm anyone.” The scientists detailed their findings on 4 April at the USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation Conference in Renton, Wash.

And how Xerox lost it An undated exterior view of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) is shown in Palo Alto, California. In late 1969, C. Peter McColough, chairman of Xerox Corp., told the New York Society of Security Analysts that Xerox was determined to develop “the architecture of information” to solve the problems that had been created by the “knowledge explosion.” Legend has it that McColough then turned to Jack E. Goldman, senior vice president of research and development, and said, “All right, go start a lab that will find out what I just meant.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ","A new technique may help defend privacy while permitting useful analysis of surveillance data Surveillance cameras have proliferated across the globe, raising concerns about privacy that have only deepened as machine-learning tools have now enabled automated video analysis on a massive scale.

        Toward Optoelectronic Chips That Mimic the Human Brain
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-hardware,2022-04-18,"An interview with a NIST researcher keen to improve spiking neuromorphic networks The human brain, which is made up of some 86 billion neurons connected in a neural network, can perform remarkable feats of computing. Yet it consumes just a dozen or so watts. How does it do it?  IEEE Spectrum recently spoke with Jeffrey Shainline, a physicist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colo., whose work may shine some light on this question. Shainline is pursuing an approach to computing that can power advanced forms of artificial intelligence—so-called spiking neural networks, which more closely mimic the way the brain works compared with the kind of artificial neural networks that are widely deployed now. Today, the dominant paradigm uses software running on digital computers to create artificial neural networks that have multiple layers of neurons. These “deep” artificial neural networks have proved immensely successful, but they require enormous computing resources and energy to run. And those energy requirements are growing quickly: in particular, the calculations involved in training deep neural networks are becoming unsustainable. Researchers have long been tantalized by the prospect of creating artificial neural networks that more closely reflect what goes on in networks of biological neurons, where, as one neuron accepts signals from multiple other neurons, it may reach a threshold level of activation that causes it to “fire,” meaning that it produces an output signal spike that is sent to other neurons, perhaps inducing some of them to fire as well. “Compared with semiconductors, you can fit many more neurons and synapses on a wafer because you can stack in the third dimension. You can have maybe 10 layers, and that’s a big advantage.”—Jeffrey Shainline, NIST A few companies have produced chips for implementing electronic spiking neural networks. Shainline’s research focuses on using superconducting optoelectronic elements in such networks. His work has recently advanced from investigating theoretical possibilities to performing hardware experiments. He tells Spectrum about these latest developments in his lab. I’ve heard for years about neuromorphic processing chips from IBM and elsewhere, but I don’t get a sense that they have gained traction in the practical world. Am I wrong? Jeffrey Shainline: Good question: Spiking neural networks—what are they good for? IBM’s True North chip from 2014 made a big splash because it was new and different and exciting. More recently, Intel has been doing great things with its Loihi chip. Intel now has its second generation of that. But whether these chips will solve real problems remains a big question. We know that biological brains can do things that are unmatched by digital computers. Yet these spiking neuromorphic chips don’t immediately knock our socks off. Why not? I don’t think that’s an easy question to answer. One thing that I’ll point out is that one of these chips doesn’t have 10 billion neurons (roughly the number of neurons in a person’s brain). Even a fruit-fly brain has about 150,000 neurons. Intel’s most recent Loihi chip doesn’t even have that. Knowing that they are struggling with what they’re going to do with this chip, the folks at Intel have done something clever: They’re giving academics and startups cheap access to their chip—for free in a lot of cases. They’re crowdsourcing creativity in hopes that somebody will find a killer app. What would you guess the first killer app will be? Shainline: Maybe a smart speaker, a speaker needs to be always on waiting for you to say some keyword or phrase. That normally requires a lot of power. But studies have shown that a very simple spiking neural algorithm running in one simple chip can do this while using almost no power. Tell me about the optoelectronic devices that you and your NIST colleagues are working on and how they might improve spiking neural networks. Shainline: First, you need to understand that light is going to be the best way that you can communicate between neurons in a spiking neural system. That’s because nothing can go faster than light. So using light for communication will allow you to have the biggest spiking neural network possible. But it’s not enough to just send signals fast. You also need to do it in an energy-efficient manner. So once you’ve chosen to send signals in the form of light, the best energy efficiency you can achieve is if you send just one photon from a neuron to each of its synaptic connections. You can’t make an amount of light any less. And the superconducting detectors we are investigating are the best there is when it comes to detecting single photons of light—best in terms of how much energy they dissipate and how fast they can operate. You could also build a spiking neural network that uses room-temperature semiconductors to send and receive optical signals, though. And right now, it isn’t obvious which strategy is best. But because I’m biased, let me share some reasons to pursue the superconducting approach. Admittedly, using superconducting elements imposes a lot of overhead—you have to build everything in a cryogenic environment so that your devices remain cold enough to superconduct. But once you’ve done that, you can easily add another crucial element: something called a Josephson junction. Josephson junctions are the key building block for superconducting computing hardware, whether they’re for superconducting qubits in a quantum computer, superconducting digital logic gates, or superconducting neurons. Once you’ve decided to use light for communication and superconducting single-photon detectors to sense that light, you will have to build your computer in a cryogenic environment. So without further overhead, you now have Josephson junctions at your disposal. And this brings a benefit that’s not obvious: It turns out that it is easier to integrate Josephson junctions in three dimensions than it is to integrate [MOSFETs—metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors] in three dimensions. That’s because with semiconductors, you fabricate MOSFETs on the lower plane of a silicon wafer. Then you put all your wiring layers up on top. And it becomes essentially impossible to put another layer of MOSFETs on top of that with standard processing techniques. In contrast, it’s not hard to fabricate Josephson junctions on multiple planes. Two different research groups have demonstrated that. The same is true for the single-photon detectors that we’ve been talking about. This is a key benefit when you consider what will be needed to allow these networks to scale into something resembling a brain in complexity. Compared with semiconductors, you can fit many more neurons and synapses on a wafer because you can stack in the third dimension. You can have maybe 10 layers, and that’s a big advantage. The theoretical implications of this approach to computing are impressive. But what kind of hardware have you and your colleagues actually built? Shainline: One of our most exciting recent results is the demonstration of the integration of superconducting single-photon detectors with Josephson junctions. What that allows us to do is receive single photons of light and use that to switch a Josephson junction and produce an electrical signal and then integrate the signals from many photon pulses. We’ve recently demonstrated that technology here in our lab. We have also fabricated on a chip light sources that work at low temperatures. And we’ve spent a lot of time on the waveguides needed to carry light signals around on a chip, too. I mentioned the 3D-integration—the stacking—that’s possible with this kind of computing technology. But if you’re going to have each neuron communicate to a few thousand other neurons, you would also need some way for optical signals to transition without loss from a waveguide in one layer to a waveguide in another layer. We’ve demonstrated that with as many as three stacked planes of these waveguides and believe we could extend that to 10 or so layers. When you say “integration,” do you just mean that you’ve wired these components together, or do you have everything working on one chip? Shainline: We have indeed combined superconducting single-photon detectors with Josephson junctions on one chip. That chip gets mounted on a little printed circuit board that we put inside a cryostat to keep it cold enough to remain superconducting. And we use fiber optics for communication from room temperature to low temperature. Why are you so keen to pursue this approach, and why aren’t others doing the same? Shainline: There are some pretty strong theoretical arguments as to why this approach to neuromorphic computing could be quite a game changer. But it requires interdisciplinary thinking and collaboration, and right now, we’re really the only group doing specifically this. I would love it if more people got into the mix. My goal as a researcher is not to be the one that does all this stuff first. I'd be very pleased if researchers from different backgrounds contributed to the development of this technology!

        “Algorithmic Destruction” Policy Defangs Dodgy AI
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-concerns-algorithmic-destruction,2022-04-15,"New regulatory tactic of deleting ill-gotten algorithms could have bite  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has set its sights on tech companies, finding ways to thwart deceitful data practices. On 4 March, the FTC issued a settlement order against WW International (the company previously known as Weight Watchers) and its subsidiary, Kurbo, with FTC chair Lina Khan stating that “Weight Watchers and Kurbo marketed weight management services for use by children as young as eight, and then illegally harvested their personal and sensitive health information.” The FTC required the companies to “delete their ill-gotten data, destroy any algorithms derived from it, and pay a penalty for their lawbreaking.” Algorithms are a finite sequence of commands and a set of rules in a computer program used to process data. In the case of AI, machine learning algorithms are trained on data to build models that could predict certain actions or make specific decisions. “So when you have to destroy that algorithm, there’s a financial consequence for the company, because that’s their work product generating revenue that they have to give up.”—Divya Ramjee, Washington College of Law “When an algorithm is trained on private data, it would be simple to figure out some or all of that data from the algorithm. This means that just deleting the private data wouldn’t be an effective remedy and wouldn’t prevent future privacy harms,” says Kit Walsh, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “So when you have an important interest like privacy and it’s necessary to delete the algorithm to address the harm, that’s when algorithmic destruction orders are on the firmest footing.” Aside from curbing privacy harms, algorithmic destruction could hold organizations liable not only for how they gather data but also the methods for processing that data. “It’s adding this twofold approach to holding companies accountable when they go about harvesting data through deceptive means and using that data to generate algorithms,” says Divya Ramjee, a senior fellow at American University’s Center for Security, Innovation, and New Technology and a fellow at Washington College of Law’s Tech, Law & Security Program. Destroying algorithms could render software useless and negatively affect a company’s bottom line. “At the end of the day, companies are doing this work for money,” Ramjee says. “They’re collecting data and creating algorithms that are essentially a product being sold and generating more money for them. So when you have to destroy that algorithm, there’s a financial consequence for the company because that’s their work product generating revenue that they have to give up.” The FTC is increasingly applying algorithmic destruction as a tool to keep tech firms in check. In a 2021 settlement, the commission said that Everalbum, a now-defunct cloud photo-storage company, “must obtain consumers’ express consent before using facial recognition technology on their photos and videos,” and required the company to “delete the photos and videos of Ever app users who deactivated their accounts and the models and algorithms it developed by using the photos and videos uploaded by its users.” A similar directive was issued to Cambridge Analytica, ordering the consulting firm to delete or destroy the information it collected about Facebook users through an app, as well as “any information or work product, including any algorithms or equations, that originated, in whole or in part, from this Covered Information.” “The algorithm itself often communicates private information and leads to repeated privacy violations when shared or used. So the justification for deleting it is comparable to deleting the data that the company unlawfully collected,” Walsh says. “It would undermine people’s privacy even further if companies could violate the law and essentially get away with taking people’s private information simply because they turned it into algorithms before getting caught. This [WW International and Kurbo] settlement is a good sign that regulators aren’t going to fall for that.” And although directing companies to destroy the algorithms they developed using ill-acquired data may not completely prevent deceitful data practices, it’s a move in the right direction, Ramjee says. “There are always companies that are going to do things deceptively, but this is a good tool for trying to put a pause on how they’re aggregating and using data,” says Ramjee. “It’s a first step to show that these companies can’t just run rampant, especially when you have these big companies with multimillion-dollar fines slapped on them. It acts as a deterring factor to show you can’t simply get away with this.” Legislative bodies across the globe are recognizing the need to hold firms responsible for illegally collecting data and using them to develop or train algorithms. As a result, more regulations will likely be in place to mitigate the issues that come with these practices. The European Union (E.U.) is already leading the way with its General Protection Data Regulation (GDPR), but it’s also proposing an Artificial Intelligence Act. “The E.U. proposal does include a potential remedy of deletion or retraining,” Walsh says. The FTC will potentially continue investigating companies and imposing algorithmic destruction, but Ramjee believes a more comprehensive federal privacy law is crucial to stop deceitful companies in their tracks. “You can also have a presumably unbiased third party checking data and helping validate what’s going on in those platforms,” she says. The onus now falls on companies to establish more ethical data practices. “As consumers, we’re now much more concerned about how our data is being used because we know these algorithms are working in ways that cater to us—whether good or bad,” says Ramjee. “Consumers are pushing for privacy and thirsting for transparency, so it would behoove companies to be up front about what and how data is being used in a way that’s digestible for the average consumer.” Rina Diane Caballar is a journalist and former software engineer based in Wellington, New Zealand.

        A Smart Home System That Respects Privacy
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-smart-home-system-that-is-accurate-and-respectful-of-privacy,2022-04-14,"The new device from MIT’s Media Lab relies on passive carbon dioxide and infrared sensors   This article is part of our exclusive IEEE Journal Watch series in partnership with IEEE Xplore. By sensing human activity and adjusting the environmental settings accordingly, smart-home systems could help create more energy-efficient and sustainable buildings. However, there have been privacy concerns when it comes to these systems monitoring peoples’ activity, and smart-home systems can require heavy amounts of data crunching to learn how to respond to a given environment.  A new smart system, dubbed Chameleon, is designed to address both of these issues. It was recently tested in two different environments over the course of a month, and could predict human activity with 87 to 99 percent accuracy after just one week of training. The results are described in a study published 6 April in IEEE Internet of Things Journal.  Andres Rico is a graduate research assistant at the MIT Media Lab’s City Science Group who was involved in the study. He and his colleagues built their system around carbon dioxide and passive infrared (PIR) sensors. “Carbon dioxide and PIR data inherently are not intrusive,” explains Rico, noting that systems based on cameras or other optical systems can raise privacy concerns.  Carbon dioxide and infrared sensing could be useful for estimating a variety of scenarios, such as the number of people in a room and how heavily they are breathing, which can indicate resting or active states. Each scenario has unique carbon dioxide and infrared signatures which can be analyzed using machine learning.  The Chameleon smart-home system uses both supervised and unsupervised machine-learning algorithms. As a result, the system already has some general knowledge on how to assess any environment, but it can also learn to distinguish the unique variables of its new environment too. This combination can reduce the time and costs associated with calibrating and maintaining the system, says Rico.  The new Chameleon wall-mounted smart system has an infrared and CO₂ sensor modules connected to a Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller. MIT Media Lab The MIT researchers put Chameleon to the test in two different environments: an office with a handful of employees and a classroom that had 15 to 20 occupants on any given day. All components—including the circuit board and carbon dioxide and PIR sensors—were combined onto a single unit and mounted on a wall.  Although the study ran for a month,  the results show that the smart-home system was able to classify the activities being done in the rooms with high accuracy after just one week of training. “The system delivers these results within rooms that are entirely different—this is very valuable for scaling these devices to more buildings and use cases,” says Rico.  He says his team hopes to incorporate Chameleon into more real-world spaces, helping to create smarter buildings. For example, it could help a single room be used for a wide variety of activities (for example, video meeting, exercising, sleeping, and having a meal with friends) and respond appropriately to each.  “These systems can also be integrated into digital urban-planning processes so as to inform communities on how they are using spaces in order to build consensus about policies to change, operate, and maintain offices, classrooms, parks, homes, etc.” says Rico.

 An almost Machiavellian plot pitted Fairchild against Texas Instruments In one corner stood the defending champion, Texas Instruments. In the other stood the challenger, Fairchild Semiconductor. The referee, judge, promoter, and only spectator was Polaroid. In contention was the contract for the electronics of Polaroid’s secret project—a pioneering product introduced in 1972 as the SX-70, a camera eventually purchased by millions of people. As the embodiment of truly automated instant photography, the SX-70 fulfilled a long-held dream of Edwin Land, founder of Polaroid Corp., Cambridge, Mass. Vital to this “point and shoot” capability was a new film—one that would develop while exposed to light and so eliminate the tear-away covers of previous Polaroid films. Also vital were sophisticated electronics to control all single lens reflex (SLR) camera functions, including flashbulb selection, exposure control, mirror positioning, start of print development, and ejection of print. These circuits were divided into three modules, one each for motor, exposure and logic, and flash control. At the final count, some 400 transistors were used.

Now scientists have created the first prototype of a device known as a quantum memristor, which might help bring together the best of both of those worlds—combining artificial intelligence with quantum computing for unprecedented capabilities. A memristor, or memory resistor, is a kind of building block for electronic circuits that scientists predicted roughly 50 years ago but created for the first time only a little more than a decade ago. These components are essentially electric switches that can remember whether they were toggled on or off after their power is turned off. As such, they resemble synapses—the links between neurons in the human brain—whose electrical conductivity strengthens or weakens depending on how much electrical charge has passed through them in the past. In theory, memristors can act like artificial neurons capable of both computing and storing data. As such, researchers have suggested that neuromorphic or brainlike computers built using memristors would perform well at running neural networks, which are machine-learning systems that use synthetic versions of synapses and neurons to mimic the process of learning in the human brain. “The memristor, unlike any other quantum component, has memory.”—Michele Spagnolo, University of Vienna Now scientists in Austria and Italy have developed a quantum version of the memristor that they suggest could lead to quantum neuromorphic computers. They detailed their findings online last month in the journal Nature Photonics. Quantum computers rely on how the universe becomes a fuzzy place at its very smallest levels. For example, atoms, photons, and other building blocks of the cosmos can exist in states of flux known as superpositions, meaning they can essentially be located in two or more places at once, or spin in two opposite directions at the same time. Whereas classical computers switch transistors either on or off to symbolize data as ones or zeroes, quantum computers use quantum bits—qubits—that can be in a state of superposition where they are both 1 and 0 simultaneously. The more qubits that are linked together in a quantum computer, the greater its computational power can grow, in an exponential fashion. Scientists are still researching the specific problems for which quantum computing might have an advantage over classical computing. Recently, they have begun exploring whether quantum computing might help boost machine learning. Previous research suggested developing a quantum memristor using photons to help support quantum machine learning. However, that prior work “would have been extremely challenging to realize, because it required to create a quantum superposition of a one-photon state with a zero-photon—that is, a vacuum—state,” says study lead author Michele Spagnolo, a doctoral student in quantum physics at the University of Vienna. In the new study, Spagnolo and his colleagues instead developed a quantum memristor that relies on a stream of photons existing in superpositions where each single photon can travel down two separate paths laser-written onto glass. One of the channels in this single-qubit integrated photonic circuit is used to measure the flow of these photons, and this data, through a complex electronic feedback scheme, controls the transmissions on the other path, resulting in the device behaving like a memristor. Normally, memristive behavior and quantum effects are not expected to coexist, Spagnolo notes. Memristors are devices that essentially work by measuring the data flowing within them, but quantum effects are infamously fragile when it comes to any outside interference such as measurements. The researchers note they overcame this apparent contradiction by engineering interactions within their device to be strong enough to enable memristivity but weak enough to preserve quantum behavior. Using computer simulations, the researchers suggest quantum memristors could lead to an exponential growth in performance in a machine-learning approach known as reservoir computing that excels at learning quickly. “Potentially, quantum reservoir computing may have a quantum advantage over classical reservoir computing,” Spagnolo says. The advantage of using a quantum memristor in quantum machine learning as opposed to conventional quantum circuits is “the fact that the memristor, unlike any other quantum component, has memory,” Spagnolo says. The next step in this work is to connect several memristors together, Spagnolo notes. Future research can also scale up by increasing the number of photons in each memristor and the number of states in which they can exist within each device, he adds. Charles Q.

        The First High-Yield, Sub-Penny Plastic Processor
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/plastic-microprocessor,2022-06-14,"It took a major redesign for cheap flexible chips to reach their promise Using PragmatIC’s manufacturing process to make a 4-bit microcontroller on plastic, engineers performed what they believe is the first yield study on plastic processors. For decades, hopeful techies have been promising a world where absolutely every object you encounter—bandages, bottles, bananas—will have some kind of smarts thanks to supercheap programmable plastic processors. If you’ve been wondering why that hasn’t happened yet, it’s that nobody has built working processors that can be made in the billions for less than a penny each. It hasn’t been for want of trying; in 2021 Arm reproduced its simplest 32-bit microcontroller, the M0, in plastic, but even this couldn’t hope to meet the mark. The problem, according to engineers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and at British flexible-electronics manufacture PragmatIC Semiconductor, is that even the simplest industry-standard microcontrollers are too complex to make on plastic in bulk. In research to be presented at the International Symposium on Computer Architecture later this month, the transatlantic team presents a simple yet fully functional plastic processor that could be made at sub-penny prices. The Illinois team designed 4-bit and 8-bit processors specifically to minimize size and maximize the percentage of working integrated circuits produced. Eighty-one percent of the 4-bit version worked, and that’s a good enough yield, says team leader Rakesh Kumar, to breach the one-penny barrier. “Flexible electronics has been niche for decades,” says Kumar. He adds that this yield study shows “that they may be ready for the mainstream.” The processors his team built were made using the flexible thin-film semiconductor indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO), which can be built on plastic and continues to work even when bent around a radius of millimeters. But while a reliable manufacturing process is a prerequisite, it was the design that made the difference. You might be wondering why silicon processors can’t do the job of supercheap flexible computing. Kumar’s analysis suggest it won’t work. Compared to plastic, silicon is expensive and inflexible, but if you make the chip small enough, the plastic can just bend around it. However, silicon fails at the task for two reasons: One is that although the area of circuitry could be made supersmall, you still need to leave a comparatively large amount of space around the edges so that the chip can be cut out of the wafer. In the case of a microcontroller as simple as the Flexicore, there would be more space around the edge than there is area containing circuitry. What’s more, you’ll need still more room to fit enough I/O pads so data and power can get to the chip. Suddenly, you’ve got a large area of costly blank silicon, pushing up expenses past the critical US $0.01 mark. Instead of adapting an existing microcontroller architecture to plastic, Kumar’s team started from scratch to create a design called Flexicore. “Yield goes down very quickly as you increase gate count,” says Kumar. Knowing that, they came up with a design meant to minimize the number of gates needed. Using 4-bit and 8-bit logic instead of 16-bit or 32-bit helped. As did separating the memory that stores instructions from the memory that stores data. But they also cut down on the number and complexity of the instructions the processor is capable of executing. The team further simplified, by designing the processor so it executes an instruction in a single clock cycle instead of the multistep pipelines of today’s CPUs. Then they designed logic that implements those instructions by reusing parts, further reducing the gate count. “In general, we were able to simplify the design of FlexiCores by tailoring them to the needs of flexible applications, which tend to be computationally simple,” says Nathaniel Bleier, Kumar’s student. All of this resulted in a 5.6-square-millimeter 4-bit FlexiCore made up of just 2,104 semiconductor devices (about the same as the number of transistors in an Intel 4004 from 1971) versus some 56,340 devices for PlasticARM. “It’s an order of magnitude less than the tiniest silicon microcontrollers in terms of gate count,” he says. The team also developed an 8-bit version of FlexiCore, but it did not yield as well. “This is exactly the kind of design innovation needed to support truly ubiquitous electronics,” says Scott White, CEO of PragmatIC Semiconductor. With PragmatIC, the Illinois team produced plastic-coated wafers full of 4-bit and 8-bit processors and tested them at a variety of voltages on multiple programs and bent them without mercy. The experiment seems basic, but according to Kumar, it’s groundbreaking. Most research processors built using nonsilicon technologies yield so poorly that results are reported from one or at best a few working chips. “This is the first work, to the best of our knowledge, where anyone reported data from multiple chips for any nonsilicon technology,” he says. Not satisfied with this success, Kumar’s team came up with a design tool to explore architectural optimizations for different applications. For example, the tool showed that power consumption could be reduced considerably by allowing the gate count to inch up a bit. The chip industry has been targeted toward “the metrics of power and performance and to some degree reliability,” observed Kumar. “We haven’t focused on cost, conformality, and thinness. Focusing on those allows us to build new computer architectures and target new applications.” Flexible electronics pioneer John A. Rogers, at Northwestern University, called the work “very impressive.” He looks forward to experimental studies of the effects of bending on circuit performance. AMD, Graphcore, and Intel show why the industry’s leading edge is going vertical A crop of high-performance processors is showing that the new direction for continuing Moore’s Law is all about up. Each generation of processor needs to perform better than the last, and, at its most basic, that means integrating more logic onto the silicon. But there are two problems: One is that our ability to shrink transistors and the logic and memory blocks they make up is slowing down. The other is that chips have reached their size limits. Photolithography tools can pattern only an area of about 850 square millimeters, which is about the size of a top-of-the-line Nvidia GPU.
 
	For a few years now, developers of systems-on-chips have begun to break up their ever-larger designs into smaller chiplets and link them together inside the same package to effectively increase the silicon area, among other advantages. In CPUs, these links have mostly been so-called 2.5D, where the chiplets are set beside each other and connected using short, dense interconnects. Momentum for this type of integration will likely only grow now that most of the major manufacturers have agreed on a 2.5D chiplet-to-chiplet communications standard.

        Quantum Computers Exponentially Faster at Untangling Insights
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-computing,2022-06-13,"Classical computers cannot overcome the “quantum advantage” in simulating chemistry and physics experiments Using Google’s Sycamore quantum processor, a new study reveals that quantum computers need exponentially fewer experiments than classical machines to reveal insights about viruses, black holes, and more. Quantum computers can theoretically achieve a quantum advantage where they can find the answers to problems no classical computer could solve even if given thousands of years or more. This advantage can grow exponentially when a quantum computer links together a greater number of qubits—the quantum-mechanically entangled bits that such a computer uses. One quantum-computing application that has drawn plenty of attention is code breaking. However, when Nobel laureate Richard Feynman first proposed the idea of quantum computers, he envisioned them modeling quantum systems such as molecules—for instance, undertaking chemistry and physics simulations that might yield insights into next-generation batteries or new drugs. “My primary aspiration is to build a quantum artificial superintelligence,” says study coauthor Robert Hsin-Yuan Huang, a theoretical quantum physicist and theoretical computer scientist at Caltech, in Pasadena, Calif. “We are very far from being able to achieve that goal. But I always feel that there are many questions we can explore now to bring us closer to that dream. Understanding how quantum technology could improve our ability to learn from the physical world is a very important first step towards this ambitious goal.” In the new study, researchers focused on how both classical and quantum computers might analyze data collected about quantum systems during experiments. In both conventional and quantum-enhanced experiments, sensors may collect multiple readings of a quantum system. However, conventional experiments can analyze such readings only one at a time, whereas a quantum-enhanced experiment can entangle these multiple readings and analyze them all at once. In experiments employing up to 40 qubits and 1,300 quantum gates in the 54-qubit Sycamore processor, the researchers found that quantum machines can learn from exponentially fewer experiments than those required in conventional experiments. “These results provide the first rigorous foundation showing that emerging quantum technology can significantly improve how humans can learn about nature in physics, chemistry, material science, and biology,” Huang says. The researchers focused on three different tasks—predicting the properties of a quantum system after scanning its properties; predicting the properties of a key component of a quantum system after analyzing its behavior; and modeling the behavior of a quantum system. Their findings suggest that no conventional experiments with classical computers can overcome the quantum advantage seen with quantum computers on such tasks. “This gives me hope that quantum computers will allow us to see and learn about parts of our universe that would otherwise be invisible,” says study coauthor Jarrod McClean, a theoretical quantum physicist and theoretical computer scientist at Google Quantum AI in Venice, Calif. Currently quantum computers are noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) platforms, meaning they are error-ridden and at most possess only a few dozen to a few hundred qubits. However, the researchers note their results suggest that even today’s NISQ processors can display a substantial quantum advantage when it comes to learning from experiments. “The physical experiments on Google’s Sycamore processor show that a huge quantum advantage can already be seen on noisy quantum machines,” Huang says. “This shows that we may be able to see how quantum technology can transform science sooner than we originally think.” The scientists detailed their findings 9 June in the journal Science.

        Regulators Rush to Become “Crypto-Friendly”
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/cryptocurrency-blockchain-regulation,2022-06-10,"Blockchain-conscious policies are proliferating worldwide—balancing innovation against protection Regulation might seem anathema to cryptocurrencies, whose entire raison d’être is to circumvent the power of governments and banks to control how people use their money. But as the technology pushes into the mainstream, there’s a growing sense that new rules are both necessary and even beneficial, leading to a boom in national experiments in crypto regulation. Some countries clearly see cryptocurrencies as a direct threat to the power of the state and have instituted outright bans, most famously in China, which had previously been a major hub for crypto activity. But others are attempting a careful balancing act, trying to manage the potential dangers without stifling innovation in a potentially lucrative new industry. There’s no established playbook for how to regulate such a new technology though, and Sergiu Hamza, CEO of crypto analyst firm Coincub, says the pace of experimentation has accelerated dramatically in the last year. His company provides a ranking of crypto-friendly countries which considers things like adoption levels and local talent, but also regulation and tax rules. “It changes so fast,” he says. “In the last month, we have compiled a list of 150 news articles on different regulation changes, with at least 10 countries radically changing their positions.” Many in the cryptocurrency industry welcome regulation, because it provides clarity for both users and service providers about where they stand in the eyes of the law.  What those regulations look like varies considerably from country to country, says Hamza. In general though, they typically deal with questions of taxation, how to recognize and regulate the activity of key crypto players like exchanges and coin issuers, and also whether to classify cryptocurrencies as money, investments, or something else entirely. One of the most pressing questions often concerns taxes, and some countries have implemented highly favorable regimes to tempt crypto users and firms to their shores. Hungary, for instance, has initiated a flat 15 percent tax on cryptocurrency gains at the time they’re converted into fiat, with no other income or capital gains taxes. And while die-hard crypto-anarchists might bristle at this kind of government oversight, Hamza says many in the industry welcome regulation of its core activities, because it provides clarity for both users and service providers about where they stand in the eyes of the law. Perhaps unsurprisingly, major financial hubs like Singapore and Switzerland and tax havens like Malta and the Bahamas have been ahead of the pack when it comes to passing more sophisticated crypto regulation. “Countries that are used to financial innovation and countries that are at the forefront of technology, obviously it’s easier for them to understand crypto and deal with it,” says Hamza. Malta for instance was one of the first countries to formally regulate cryptocurrencies when it passed a trio of laws in 2018 that defined what counts as a “Virtual Financial Asset” and set out rules for how they could be issued, traded, and exchanged. Singapore has also been proactive, running a regulatory sandbox for fintech companies since 2016 that relaxes legal requirements to enable experimentation. It also introduced the Payment Services Act in 2019, which regulated how cryptocurrencies could be issued and brought exchanges and other crypto firms under the oversight of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The country that topped Coincub’s rankings for crypto-friendliness was Germany. While its first-place finish was also due to high adoption and a burgeoning crypto industry, Germany has been making progressive regulatory moves, says Hamza. The country charges no tax on gains from crypto held for longer than a year, and a law close to being passed will allow investment funds called spezialfonds, which are not available to retail investors and therefore more lightly regulated, to invest up to 20 percent of their holdings in cryptocurrency. “Cryptos work best at the places where more traditional instruments are not working.”—Max Semenchuk, blockchain entrepreneur Hagen Weiss, senior expert adviser at the country’s financial supervisor BaFin, says the core of its strategy for regulating crypto is “same risk, same business, same rules”. The country hasn’t set out in law how different crypto products should be treated, instead regulators look at them on a case-by-case basis and treat them the same way they would treat a traditional asset with the same level of risk, but that is only possible thanks to close collaboration between regulators and the industry. “It is probably the No. 1 tool that should be used—engagement with the market,” says Weiss. “The main benefits are that if you are proactive and engage with the situation, you do two things. First, you will protect your citizens and their money, and secondly, you will harness the potential of that technology.” The attitude of regulators can often be just as important as the regulations themselves, says Hamza, which is why Coincub’s rankings include a measure of Institutional Outlook. This accounts for public statements about the authorities’ general attitude towards cryptocurrencies and how they intend to govern them going forward. That’s critical, says Hamza, given the rapid and sizable shifts that can happen. He gives the example of Portugal, which has long been seen as a crypto-friendly destination because trading and using cryptocurrencies have been tax-exempt since 2018. But the government recently announced it plans to reverse course, and although a recent bill designed to tax cryptocurrencies failed to make it through parliament, it seems likely that the country’s laissez-faire approach is coming to an end. How countries approach crypto regulation also varies considerably depending on what their motivations are. Most countries setting crypto-friendly rules are trying to boost their domestic crypto industry, but there can be other reasons too. There have been plenty of headlines about the use of cryptocurrencies in Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion—in particular the fund the government set up to allow people to donate cryptocurrencies toward its war effort. But a law recognizing cryptocurrencies as legal assets and introducing financial monitoring measures, which passed shortly after the start of the war, had been in the pipeline for years. Max Semenchuk, a blockchain entrepreneur who is currently acting as an adviser to Ukraine’s Ministry for Digital Transformation, says the country has had a progressive attitude to cryptocurrencies for some time and its goals are quite different from those of a financial hub like Switzerland. The country has had the highest level of adoption of cryptocurrency for some time, currently standing at about 12 percent of the population, and Semenchuk says the aim is primarily to support the use of the technology by individuals. “Cryptos work best at the places where more traditional instruments are not working,” he says. “There’s not so much trust for the banks. We have got some history of banks folding, and crisis and devaluation of currency.” The main use cases in Ukraine, he says, are for business-to-to business transactions, as a form of investment for everyday people, and a way to transfer money in to and out of the country. The technology also feeds into the government’s desire to push increasing digitalization of municipal services and the economy. “ ‘We should be the country of the smartphone’ is one of the big slogans,” says Semenchuk. However, experimentation inevitably involves some upsets, and regulations are likely to remain highly dynamic. Ukraine’s central bank recently banned cryptocurrency purchases in the local hryvnia currency—alongside deposits in e-wallets and foreign-exchange accounts—over concerns about money flowing out of the country during the war. And despite its generally light regulatory touch, Singapore banned crypto providers from advertising directly to retail customers at the start of the year. And in April it extended its oversight powers to include crypto companies headquartered in Singapore but providing services abroad. “The position is changing so fast right now that we can only talk about what’s happening this week or this month,” says Hamza.

        “PACMAN” Hack Breaks Apple M1’s Last Line of Defense
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/pacman-hack-can-break-apple-m1s-last-line-of-defense,2022-06-10,"How many dominos could fall if this centerpiece CPU’s weakness pans out? Apple’s M1 processor is a powerful, high-efficiency chip, though perhaps not as impervious to attacks as its initial safety record might suggest.   Apple’s M1 processor made a big splash on its November 2020 release, noteworthy for its eye-popping performance and miserly power consumption. But the value of its security may not be as obvious at first blush. A lack of serious attacks since its launch nearly two years ago indicates that its security systems, among them a last line of defense called pointer authentication codes, are working well. But its honeymoon period could possibly be coming to an end. At the International Symposium on Computer Architecture later this month, researchers led by MIT’s Mengjia Yan will present a mode of attack that so weakens the pointer authentication code (PAC) defense that the core of a computer’s operating system is made vulnerable. And because PACs may be incorporated in future processors built from the 64-bit Arm architecture, the vulnerability could  become more widespread. It’s possible that other processors are already using PACs, but the M1 was the only one available to Yan’s lab. “What we found is actually quite fundamental,” says Yan. “It’s a class of attack. Not one bug.” How PACMAN picks the lock goes to the heart of modern computing.  The vulnerability, called PACMAN, assumes that there is already a software bug in operation on the computer that can read and write to different memory addresses. It then exploits a detail of the M1 hardware architecture to give the bug the power to execute code and possibly take over the operating system. “We assume the bug is there and we make it into a more serious bug,” says Joseph Ravichandran a student of Yan’s who worked on the exploit with fellow students Weon Taek Na and Jay Lang. To understand how the attack works you have to get a handle on what pointer authentication is and how a detail of processor architecture called speculative execution works. Pointer authentication is a way to guard against software attacks that try to corrupt data that holds memory addresses, or pointers. For example, malicious code might execute a buffer overflow attack, writing more data than expected  into a part of memory, with the excess spilling over into a pointer’s address and overwriting it. That might then mean that instead of the computer’s software executing code stored at the original address, it is diverted to malware stored at the new one. Pointer authentication appends a cryptographic signature to the end of the pointer. If there’s any malicious manipulation of the pointer, the signature will no longer match up with it. PACs are used to guard the core of the system’s operating system, the kernel. If an attacker got so far as to manipulate a kernel pointer, the mismatch between the pointer and its authentication code would produce what’s called an “exception,” and the system would crash, ending the malware’s attack. Malware would have to be extremely lucky to guess the right code, about 1 in 65,000. PACMAN finds a way for malware to keep guessing over and over without any wrong guesses triggering a crash. How it does this goes to the heart of modern computing. For decades now, computers have been speeding up processing using what’s called speculative execution. In a typical program, which instruction should follow the next often depends on the outcome of the previous instruction (think if/then). Rather than wait around for the answer, modern CPUs will speculate—make an educated guess—about what comes next and start executing instructions along those lines. If the CPU guessed right, this speculative execution has saved a bunch of clock cycles. If it turns out to have guessed wrong, all the work is thrown out, and the processor begins along the correct sequence of instructions. Importantly, the mistakenly computed values are never visible to the software. There is no program you could write that would simply output the results of speculative execution. Initial solutions to PACMAN only tended to increase the processor’s overall vulnerability. However, over the past several years, researchers have discovered ways to exploit speculative execution to do things like sneak data out of CPUs. These are called side-channel attacks, because they acquire data by observing indirect signals, such as how much time it takes to access data. Spectre and Meltdown, are perhaps the best known of these side-channel attacks. Yan’s group came up with a way to trick the CPU into guessing pointer authentication codes in speculation so an exception never arises, and the OS doesn’t crash. Of course, the answer is still invisible to software. But a side-channel trick involving stuffing a particular buffer with data and using timing to uncover which part the successful speculation replaces, provides the answer. [A similar concept is explained in more detail in “How the Spectre and Meltdown Hacks Really Worked,” IEEE Spectrum, 28 February 2019.] With regard to PACMAN, Apple’s product team provided this response to Yan’s group: “We want to thank the researchers for their collaboration as this proof-of-concept advances our understanding of these techniques. Based on our analysis, as well as the details shared with us by the researchers, we have concluded this issue does not pose an immediate risk to our users and is insufficient to bypass device protections on its own.” Other researchers familiar with PACMAN say that how dangerous it really is remains to be seen. However, PACMAN “increases the number of things we have to worry about when designing new security solutions,” says Nael Abu-Ghazaleh, chair of computer engineering at University of California, Riverside, and an expert in architecture security, including speculative execution attacks. Processors makers have been adding new security solutions to their designs besides pointer authentication in recent years. He suspects that now that PACMAN has been revealed, other research will begin to find speculative attacks against these new solutions. Yan’s group explored some naive solutions to PACMAN, but they tended to increase the processor’s overall vulnerability. “It’s always an arms race,” says Keith Rebello, the former program manager of DARPA’s System Security Integrated Through Hardware and firmware (SSITH) program and currently a senior technical fellow at the Boeing Company. PACs are there “to make it much harder to exploit a system, and they have made it a lot harder. But is it the complete solution? No.” He’s hopeful that tools developed through SSITH, such as rapid re-encryption, could help. Abu-Ghazaleh credits Yan’s group with opening a door to a new aspect of processor security. “People used to think software attacks were standalone and separate from hardware attacks,” says Yan. “We are trying to look at the intersection between the two threat models. Many other mitigation mechanisms exist that are not well studied under this new compounding threat model, so we consider the PACMAN attack as a starting point.” This computer rendering depicts the pattern on a photonic chip that the author and his colleagues have devised for performing neural-network calculations using light. Think of the many tasks to which computers are being applied that in the not-so-distant past required human intuition. Computers routinely identify objects in images, transcribe speech, translate between languages, diagnose medical conditions, play complex games, and drive cars.

        Data Is Vulnerable to Quantum Computers That Don’t Exist Yet
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/post-quantum-cryptography,2022-06-09,"A new spin-off from Alphabet has a plan to transition to postquantum cryptography Future quantum computers may rapidly break modern cryptography. Now a new spin-off from Google’s parent company Alphabet warns that sensitive data is already vulnerable to quantum computers that don’t exist yet, courtesy of codebreaking attacks that steal that data now and could decrypt it in the future. Therefore, it has developed a road map to help businesses, governments and other organizations begin the shift to post-quantum cryptography now. The new startup, Sandbox AQ (which stands for AI and quantum), has already attracted clients including Mount Sinai Health System, telecommunications firm Softbank Mobile, communications technology company Vodafone Business, and Web developer Wix. It has also reeled in investors including the CIA’s venture capital arm In-Q-Tel and cybersecurity-focused investment firm Paladin Capital Group. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt is serving as the chairman of its board of directors. In addition, Sandbox AQ has already partnered with two of the world’s largest professional service firms, Ernst & Young and Deloitte, to help deploy post-quantum cryptography. “These firms have the scale to educate, engage, and upgrade post-quantum cryptography for their Global 1000 clients, which represent the world’s largest and most successful companies,” says David Joseph, a research scientist at Sandbox AQ in Palo Alto, Calif. “Doing this will multiply the impact of our quantum solutions and help companies protect their customers, data, networks, and other assets today, without having to wait until error-corrected quantum computers become available.” Quantum computers theoretically can quickly solve problems it might take classical computers untold eons to solve. For example, much of modern cryptography depends on the extreme difficulty that classical computers face with regard to mathematical problems such as factoring huge numbers, but quantum computers could in principle rapidly crack even highly secure RSA-2048 encryption. To stay ahead of quantum computers, scientists around the world have spent the past two decades designing post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms. These are based on new mathematical problems that both quantum and classical computers find difficult to solve. In January, the White House issued a memorandum on transitioning to quantum-resistant cryptography, underscoring that preparations for this transition should begin as soon as possible. However, after organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) help decide which PQC algorithms should become the new standards the world should adopt, there are billions of old and new devices that will need to get updated. Sandbox AQ notes that such efforts could take decades to implement. Although quantum computers are currently in their infancy, there are already attacks that can steal encrypted data with the intention to crack it once codebreaking quantum computers become a reality. Therefore, the Sandbox AQ argues that governments, businesses, and other major organizations must begin the shift toward PQC now. For example, in a store-now-decrypt-later attack, adversaries would capture precious encrypted information now, store it, and decrypt it when practical quantum computers exist. Stolen data could include medical records, national security documents, trade secrets, and more—any information that may still prove valuable even decades later. “We know for a fact that store-now-decrypt-later attacks are happening right now, and their frequency will only increase the closer we get to delivering a fault-tolerant quantum computer,” Joseph says. “Once encrypted data has been exfiltrated, there is no way to protect it from future decryption and exploitation.” Store-now-decrypt-later attacks do not need high-profile breaches to succeed. “They could be performed silently by first observing encrypted data on public networks, which would be very difficult to detect,” Joseph says. “Over the public Internet, encrypted data might be sent via many different nodes, and any one of these nodes could be compromised, copying and storing valuable data before forwarding it on to its intended final destination.” The main difficulty in executing store-now-decrypt-later attacks is figuring out which data to target, “as there will be an enormous volume of encrypted data and only a finite amount of quantum computing resources,” Joseph says. “We expect the first quantum-enabled adversaries will be nation-states, and it may not be public knowledge exactly when one of them gains access to a large, fault-tolerant device capable of breaking RSA-2048.” Another reason shifting to post-quantum cryptography may prove important is because of projects that are getting designed and planned now but may have life spans of decades, such as many cars, planes, trains, and ships in production now, or critical national infrastructure projects. The hardware needed to implement cryptography may essentially remain immutable for the lifetime of these products and projects, so the earlier they can get protected, the better, Joseph and his colleagues note. The inspiration to launch Sandbox AQ grew from discussions between security teams within Alphabet starting from 2016. “It became apparent that there was a huge wealth of experience across the now–Sandbox AQ team and the Googlers across Alphabet, but most of this expertise was focused on distinct, introspective efforts that directly benefited Google’s customers,” Joseph says. “However, when we spoke with decision-makers at external organizations, it became clear that what was ‘common knowledge’ in the security community was not well known at large.” Sandbox AQ’s efforts to explain the importance of PQC led the startup to draft a new road map for organizations to shift past traditional cryptography. The company detailed its road map on 11 May in the journal Nature. The first recommendation Sandbox AQ makes is to figure out where PQC transition is needed first. The workforce to perform these upgrades is highly specialized and usually scarce, and so needs to get deployed in ways that make the most of resources to protect systems best. This involves identifying the cryptographic schemes that are at highest risk, such as key exchange algorithms, the kind that often underlie secure messages and data transfers. Instead of replacing existing algorithms with relatively untested PQC alternatives, the road map notes that scientists have developed hybrid algorithms combining both traditional algorithms and post-quantum algorithms. Therefore, even if the PQC algorithm later proves flawed, at least the classical algorithm can still provide a measure of security. The road map notes that NIST’s PQC project is close to the end of its third round and standards for the algorithms selected are expected to be released no later than 2024. Sandbox AQ recommends that organizations may want to start experimenting now with the finalist and alternative candidates. The company also suggests considering stateful hash-based signature technology for applications such as software code signing, as NIST and other bodies have already standardized it. The most comprehensive repository of the software implementations of the NIST schemes is Liboqs of the Open Quantum Safe project. Other resources include BoringSSL, Tink, and SUPERCOP. Due to the current diversity of PQC alternatives, the need to change from one algorithm to another in case of a successful attack, and the desire for increasing connectedness between systems, the road map also recommends “crypto-agility,” or the ability to switch between cryptographic schemes. Sandbox AQ notes that standards bodies should make 6G wireless technologies, for example, inherently crypto-agile and PQC-compatible. Sandbox AQ also helps organizations shift to PQC by conducting three-phase security audits. “The first phase is discovery, where we assess and catalog the organization’s cryptographic infrastructure to understand where any potential vulnerabilities lie,” Joseph says. “We then conduct a performance analysis in order to provide a quantum readiness evaluation and risk-based PQC migration plan.” The next step “is the assessment phase, migrating selected candidates from IT infrastructure to demonstrate functional success and performance,” he says. “We catalog mitigation patterns that will become the standard for the full implementation.” Finally comes “the implementation phase, which includes the complete transition of an organization’s IT infrastructure, in order of priority,” Joseph says. “It enables cryptographic agility throughout the network and enables full sovereignty over cryptographic usage.” As dangerous as code breaking quantum computers may prove, history shows that cryptography transitions need a considerable amount of time. For example, elliptic curve cryptography was proposed in the 1980s, and despite the fact that it is far more efficient than RSA in terms of space and speed, it took more than two decades to finally gain widespread adoption. “By comparison, the transition to PQC will be larger and more complex,” Joseph says. “From this frame of reference, it became clear that awareness needs to be increased and the transition process needs to start now.” Charles Q.

        Photonic Quantum Computer Claims Speedup “Advantage”
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/photonic-quantum-computing,2022-06-09,"Quantum-powered cloud 7,800,000,000,000,000x as fast, for some problems, as a supercomputer In this graphical representation of a three-dimensional entangled state synthesized by the computer Borealis, each vertex represents a squeezed-state qubit, and each edge represents the connection (a.k.a. entanglement) between the vertices.  A new photonic quantum computer takes just 36 microseconds to perform a task that would take a conventional supercomputer more than 9,000 years to complete. The new device, named Borealis, is the first quantum computer from a startup to display such “quantum advantage” over regular computers. Borealis is also the first machine capable of quantum advantage to be made available to the public over the cloud. Quantum computers can theoretically achieve a quantum advantage that enables them to find the answers to problems no classical computers could ever solve. The more components known as qubits that a quantum computer has, the greater its computational power can grow, in an exponential fashion. Many companies, including giants such as Google, IBM, and Amazon as well as startups such as IonQ, rely on qubits based on superconducting circuits or trapped ions. One drawback with these approaches is that they both demand temperatures colder than those found in deep space, because heat can disrupt the qubits. The expensive, bulky cryogenic systems required to hold qubits at such frigid temperatures can also make it a major challenge to scale these platforms up to high numbers of qubits—or to smaller and more portable form factors. In contrast, quantum computers that depend on qubits based on photons can, in principle, operate at room temperature. They can also readily integrate into existing fiber-optic-based telecommunications systems, potentially helping connect quantum computers into powerful networks and even into a quantum Internet. Scientists have developed quantum computers demonstrating quantum advantage using both cryogenic and photonic approaches. In 2019, Google argued its 53-superconducting-qubit Sycamore processor could carry out a calculation in 200 seconds that the company estimated would take Summit, the world’s most powerful supercomputer at that time, 10,000 years. Then, last year, researchers in China contended that photonic quantum computer Jiuzhang 2.0 could solve a benchmark problem roughly 1024 as fast as classical supercomputers. A key drawback of Jiuzhang 2.0 was that it relied on a network of fixed mirrors and lenses. Therefore, it was not programmable, limiting its overall usefulness. Now, in a new study, quantum computing startup Xanadu, in Toronto, reveals its device, named Borealis, may be the first fully programmable photonic quantum computer to display quantum advantage. “Borealis is the first machine capable of quantum computational advantage made publicly available to anyone with an Internet connection,” says study senior author Jonathan Lavoie, systems integration team lead at Xanadu. In the Canadian company Xanadu’s photonic quantum computer Borealis, squeezed-state qubits [pink pulses] are generated from a nonlinear crystal and sent through a series of three loop-based interferometers, pictured above. Xanadu In Borealis, qubits consist of so-called “squeezed states” consisting of superpositions of multiple photons in a light pulse. Whereas traditional qubits can, because of the surreal nature of quantum physics, exist in a state known as superposition where they can symbolize both a 0 and 1 of data, squeezed states can exist in states of 0, 1, 2, 3, or more. Borealis can generate trains of up to 216 pulses of squeezed light. “It’s important to recognize that Borealis is not equivalent to a 216-qubit traditional device,” Lavoie says. “Since it uses squeezed-state qubits, it addresses a different class of quantum tasks than, say, a device based on superconducting circuit qubits or trapped ions.“ In experiments, the researchers tested Borealis on a task known as Gaussian boson sampling, in which a machine analyzes random patches of data. Gaussian boson sampling may have many practical applications, such as identifying which pairs of molecules are the best fits for each other. In prior work, Jiuzhang 2.0 detected up to 113 photons out of 144 pulses of squeezed light. In the new study, Borealis detected up to 219 photons in its squeezed-light pulse trains, with 125 on average. All in all, the scientists estimated Borealis could perform Gaussian boson sampling more than 7.8 quadrillion times as fast as Fugaku, the fastest conventional supercomputer in the world in 2021. One key advance seen in Borealis was the use of photon-number-resolving detectors. Prior machines used threshold detectors that are designed to distinguish only between “no photons detected” and “at least one photon detected.” The size of the computational problems a photonic quantum computer may tackle grows exponentially with the number of photons it can detect, so the photon-number-resolving detectors helped Borealis perform more than 50 million times as fast as previous photonic quantum computers, Lavoie says. Xanadu has made Borealis available for use for everyone over the cloud. “We are also working with partners to make it more broadly available,” Lavoie says. “We hope that its public availability will stimulate even more research around quantum advantage and Gaussian boson sampling in general.“ Xanadu’s future research “is squarely focused on achieving error correction and ultimately fault tolerance, to unlock the most valuable problems in quantum computing,” Lavoie says. “Many of the technologies and lessons learned in building Borealis will be incorporated into our architecture for [future models].”  The scientists detailed their findings in the 2 June issue of the journal Nature.

                                     ","Quantum-powered cloud 7,800,000,000,000,000x as fast, for some problems, as a supercomputer In this graphical representation of a three-dimensional entangled state synthesized by the computer Borealis, each vertex represents a squeezed-state qubit, and each edge represents the connection (a.k.a. entanglement) between the vertices. A new photonic quantum computer takes just 36 microseconds to perform a task that would take a conventional supercomputer more than 9,000 years to complete. The new device, named Borealis, is the first quantum computer from a startup to display such “quantum advantage” over regular computers. Borealis is also the first machine capable of quantum advantage to be made available to the public over the cloud. Quantum computers can theoretically achieve a quantum advantage that enables them to find the answers to problems no classical computers could ever solve. The more components known as qubits that a quantum computer has, the greater its computational power can grow, in an exponential fashion. Many companies, including giants such as Google, IBM, and Amazon as well as startups such as IonQ, rely on qubits based on superconducting circuits or trapped ions. One drawback with these approaches is that they both demand temperatures colder than those found in deep space, because heat can disrupt the qubits. The expensive, bulky cryogenic systems required to hold qubits at such frigid temperatures can also make it a major challenge to scale these platforms up to high numbers of qubits—or to smaller and more portable form factors. In contrast, quantum computers that depend on qubits based on photons can, in principle, operate at room temperature. They can also readily integrate into existing fiber-optic-based telecommunications systems, potentially helping connect quantum computers into powerful networks and even into a quantum Internet. Scientists have developed quantum computers demonstrating quantum advantage using both cryogenic and photonic approaches. In 2019, Google argued its 53-superconducting-qubit Sycamore processor could carry out a calculation in 200 seconds that the company estimated would take Summit, the world’s most powerful supercomputer at that time, 10,000 years.

        What Is Quantum Entanglement?
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/what-is-quantum-entanglement,2022-06-08,"Skip the heady and abstract physics lectures. Let’s talk about socks 
	When pushed to explain why quantum computers can outspeed classical computers, stories about quantum computing often invoke a mysterious property called “entanglement.” Qubits, the reader is assured, can somehow be quantum mechanically 
	entangled such that they depend on one another. If more detail is needed, the reader is told that entanglement links qubits no matter how far apart they are—so long as the qubits are “coherent.”
 
	For the reader, things are far from coherent. Sure, entanglement is an important aspect of quantum computing. But what exactly is it?
 
	In a few words, 
	entanglement is when multiple objects—such as a pair of electrons or photons—share a single quantum state. Like threads in a tangle of yarn, entangled objects cannot be described as independent entities.
 
	That explanation might be poetic, but it shouldn’t be satisfying. Things are not so simple or concrete. But with a little bit of high-school-level math (near the end of this story), our intuitions—based on a lifetime of classical physics—can be retrained and redirected just a bit.
 
	However, we should also make the following disclaimer: No brief explanation can be expected to convey a comprehensive understanding of quantum mechanics. Our goal is simply to illustrate the basic concepts behind entanglement, so the reader can gain a more thorough understanding of what’s actually going on in this foundational phenomenon behind quantum computing.
 
	Let’s begin with a slightly modified example from the celebrated Northern Irish physicist 
	John Stewart Bell:
 
	Alice and Bob know that Prof. Bertlmann always wears mismatched socks. If his left sock is pink, his right sock is certain to not be pink. (Our illustrations are loosely based on Bell’s own cartoons of his friend, Reinhold Bertlmann, which he drew for a 
	1980 article to explain entanglement.)
 Meet Professor Bertlmann, with his predictably and reliably mismatched socks.Mark Montgomery 
	Alice and Bob wish to test if Prof. Bertlmann’s choice in socks persists outside the classroom, so they decide to spy on him.
 
	Suppose Alice is standing one block away, and she sees that Prof. Bertlmann’s left sock is blue. Immediately, she knows that Bob—who’s keeping an eye on Bertlmann’s right sock—will see pink. This holds true even if Alice is light-years away from Bertlmann, following all the sartorial goings-on with a telescope. Once she measures the color of one sock, Alice instantaneously knows something about what Bob will measure about the other sock. This is because the pair of mismatched socks are what physicists (and overqualified wardrobe consultants) describe as being 
	correlated with one another.
 Alice sees that Prof. Bertlmann's right sock is blue; Bob can see that his left sock is pink. Mark Montgomery 
	There is no mystery to how this correlation arises: Every morning, Prof. Bertlmann intentionally mismatches his socks. If his left sock is blue, he will pull on a right sock that’s pink. These correlations have three classical characteristics: They are 
	real, local, and deterministic.
 Real: The socks have a definite color prior to Alice’s or Bob’s measurement.
 Deterministic: The color of the socks is not random. Given exactly the same initial conditions (for example, Tuesday, chance of rain, sore toe), Prof. Bertlmann will put on the mismatched socks the same way. Note: The specific colors worn on each foot may be difficult for Alice and Bob to predict, but the process is not strictly random. Local: The color of the socks depends only on nearby surroundings—that is, what Bob sees should not depend on Alice’s measurement.
 
	Let us now suppose Prof. Bertlmann wishes to teach his snooping students a thing or two about entanglement. The next morning, he puts on a mismatched pair of 
	quantum socks, whose colors are entangled.
 Prof. Bertlmann complicates the situation by introducing quantum socks—whose color is indeterminate until it’s been observed.  When Alice measures the left sock, the pair’s indeterminate state of color collapses, so that Alice sees either pink or blue.Mark Montgomery 
	Unlike his classical socks, Prof. Bertlmann’s entangled quantum socks are:
 Unreal: The socks have no definite color prior to measurement.
 Nondeterministic: The color of the socks is random. Measurements under the exact same initial conditions are unpredictable—for example, 50 percent of the time a sock will be pink, 50 percent of the time it will be blue.
 Nonlocal: The color of each sock is dependent on nonlocal surroundings—that is, what Bob sees depends on Alice’s measurement.
 
	In the quantum case, if Alice measures the color of one sock, her measurement 
	instantaneously updates the color of the other sock, which had previously been indefinite. (Note: Because the sock color is random, this does not, strictly speaking, transmit information—and therefore cannot be used for faster-than-light communication.)
 But, Alice objects, the socks are close together—couldn’t they send some signal to each other? Is the update really instantaneous? To further convince his students that there is something nonlocal happening, Prof. Bertlmann ships each of the socks to distant stars that are light-years apart from one another.  Now each of the professor's fabled quantum socks have been sent to different star systems, many light-years apart.   As before, when Alice observes the left sock, the pair's indeterminate state of color collapses. This measurement updates the color of the other sock instantaneously. For simplicity, we’ve shown only Alice measuring, but the results do not change if Bob measures too.Mark Montgomery Then he asks Alice and Bob to perform the same experiment.
 
	Again, what Bob sees depends on Alice’s measurement, even though there is no way for the socks to communicate. This result should be shocking. As Prof. Bertlmann puts it:
	 “How come they always choose different colors when they are looked at? How does the second sock know what the first has done?” 
	§
 A brief historical detour: Anxiety about entanglement originates from the famous 
	1935 EPR paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen (collectively known as EPR, from their initials). EPR recognized that quantum mechanics specified a world that was nondeterministic and nonlocal, and argued that these properties implied that quantum mechanics is incomplete as a theory. Einstein was particularly concerned about the lack of locality. He famously lamented the instantaneous measurement update between entangled particles as “spukhafte Fernwirkung” (“spooky action at a distance”) because he could not reconcile it with the “ideas of physics.” From Einstein’s letters to Max Born: 
	To preserve these reasonable assumptions—and rescue physics from the seemingly irreconcilable weirdness that quantum mechanics introduced—physicists began playing with “hidden-variable theories.”
 
	According to hidden-variable theory, in Alice and Bob’s experiment the quantum socks are secretly predetermined (by a “hidden” variable) to be one color or another, and it only 
	seems as though Alice’s measurement of the first sock instantaneously updates the color of the other sock. Hidden-variable theories, it was thought, could reproduce all the odd results quantum mechanics predicted without sacrificing local realism.
 Here is where we return to the topic of this article—because quantum entanglement lies at the heart of questions about hidden-variable theory.
 
	If hidden-variable theories are correct, entanglement is just an illusion of nonlocality; Bertlmann’s quantum socks would not in that case actually have a strange connection irrespective of distance. But if hidden-variable theories are wrong, entanglement really does link the socks no matter how far apart they are.
 
	Without any way of experimentally differentiating between 
	either theory, physicists relegated the conundrum to the realm of philosophy—until Bell, the Northern Irish physicist referenced earlier, found a solution.
 
	§
 Back to the present day, where the skeptical students Alice and Bob are unimpressed by Prof. Bertlmann’s supposedly entangled socks. Again, from their perspective, there is 
	no experimental difference between “spooky” socks and hidden-variable socks, which only appear to update each other upon measurement but whose color (according to hidden-variable theory) would actually be preordained.
 
	To enlighten his mistrustful mentees about the true nature of entanglement, Prof. Bertlmann sets up a new experiment.
 
	In this experiment, Alice and Bob fly off in spaceships. A source shoots out entangled pairs of quantum socks toward them. Alice and Bob each have special detectors with two settings. Alice’s detector can be in setting A or setting a; Bob’s detector can be set to either setting B or setting b. (To pick a setting, they each flip a coin after the socks are sent so there is no way the socks know the settings ahead of time.)
 To avoid any possible local effects, Alice and Bob fly light-years apart. They want this isolation so that they can tell if the sock color is predetermined or really updates upon measurement. When Alice and Bob have different settings (a and B, or A and b), the socks sometimes match and sometimes mismatch. When Alice and Bob share the same settings (A and B, or a and b), the socks always match. How could predetermined socks manage this correlation, if the random coin flip happened after the socks were sent?Mark Montgomery 
	Here is a sample output from Alice and Bob:
	 
	As you can see, the colors Alice and Bob measure are random. Let’s now add the detector settings, which are also random.

	The table shows that when Alice and Bob use different settings, the socks sometimes match and sometimes mismatch. But if Alice and Bob share a setting (both uppercase or both lowercase), they always match. It’s as if, despite the fact that Alice and Bob flipped coins after the socks were sent, the socks could somehow tell each other when to match across the vast distance. This is very strange—as if the sock color were predetermined!
 
	After Alice and Bob have recorded all their data, they come back to Earth, where Prof. Bertlmann explains that the strange coincidence is not quite enough to reveal the true nature of entanglement. What they need is to measure how correlated the socks are, so Alice and Bob create a new table where pinks are -1 and blues are +1.

	“There is a very simple proof—that you can check on your own—which states that the absolute value of AB - Ab + aB + ab cannot be greater than 2 if the hidden-variable theory of sock color were true,” Prof. Bertlmann explains.
 
	Counting, Alice and Bob tally up their measurements and find the averages for AB, Ab, aB, and ab:
  
	Then they plug the numbers into the formula and find that the (positive) sum exceeds 2!
  
	 Puzzled, they ask Prof. Bertlmann what it means. He responds:
  While no socks have been entangled in the real world (yet), there have been numerous experiments confirming that quantum correlations exceed Bell’s inequality, as above. The first experiments entangled electrons and photons, but in the decades since, scientists have even managed to entangle tiny, nanoscale objects, such as a pair of submicroscopic drums.

	So, what is entanglement? In our first definition, we said that “entanglement is when multiple objects share a single quantum state.” We can update that definition with what we’ve learned: Entanglement is the 
	amount by which multiple objects share a quantum state. By checking the correlations of our measurements, we can quantify how much entanglement there is between objects. The state of entangled objects cannot be described independently. Prof. Bertlmann’s quantum socks, light-years apart, are not reducible to a left sock color and a right sock color. They remain a pair of indeterminate color until they are disentangled by a measurement.
 
	In a quantum computer, qubits are separated by millimeters, not light-years. But the principle still holds, so an entangled pair really is one quantum object—at least until Alice or Bob takes a measurement.

                                     ","Skip the heady and abstract physics lectures. Let’s talk about socks When pushed to explain why quantum computers can outspeed classical computers, stories about quantum computing often invoke a mysterious property called “entanglement.” Qubits, the reader is assured, can somehow be quantum mechanically entangled such that they depend on one another. If more detail is needed, the reader is told that entanglement links qubits no matter how far apart they are—so long as the qubits are “coherent.” For the reader, things are far from coherent. Sure, entanglement is an important aspect of quantum computing. But what exactly is it? In a few words, entanglement is when multiple objects—such as a pair of electrons or photons—share a single quantum state. Like threads in a tangle of yarn, entangled objects cannot be described as independent entities. That explanation might be poetic, but it shouldn’t be satisfying. Things are not so simple or concrete. But with a little bit of high-school-level math (near the end of this story), our intuitions—based on a lifetime of classical physics—can be retrained and redirected just a bit. However, we should also make the following disclaimer: No brief explanation can be expected to convey a comprehensive understanding of quantum mechanics. Our goal is simply to illustrate the basic concepts behind entanglement, so the reader can gain a more thorough understanding of what’s actually going on in this foundational phenomenon behind quantum computing. Let’s begin with a slightly modified example from the celebrated Northern Irish physicist John Stewart Bell: Alice and Bob know that Prof. Bertlmann always wears mismatched socks. If his left sock is pink, his right sock is certain to not be pink. (Our illustrations are loosely based on Bell’s own cartoons of his friend, Reinhold Bertlmann, which he drew for a 1980 article to explain entanglement.) Meet Professor Bertlmann, with his predictably and reliably mismatched socks.Mark Montgomery Alice and Bob wish to test if Prof. Bertlmann’s choice in socks persists outside the classroom, so they decide to spy on him. Suppose Alice is standing one block away, and she sees that Prof. Bertlmann’s left sock is blue. Immediately, she knows that Bob—who’s keeping an eye on Bertlmann’s right sock—will see pink. This holds true even if Alice is light-years away from Bertlmann, following all the sartorial goings-on with a telescope. Once she measures the color of one sock, Alice instantaneously knows something about what Bob will measure about the other sock. This is because the pair of mismatched socks are what physicists (and overqualified wardrobe consultants) describe as being correlated with one another. Alice sees that Prof. Bertlmann's right sock is blue; Bob can see that his left sock is pink. Mark Montgomery There is no mystery to how this correlation arises: Every morning, Prof. Bertlmann intentionally mismatches his socks. If his left sock is blue, he will pull on a right sock that’s pink. These correlations have three classical characteristics: They are real, local, and deterministic. Real: The socks have a definite color prior to Alice’s or Bob’s measurement. Deterministic: The color of the socks is not random. Given exactly the same initial conditions (for example, Tuesday, chance of rain, sore toe), Prof. Bertlmann will put on the mismatched socks the same way. Note: The specific colors worn on each foot may be difficult for Alice and Bob to predict, but the process is not strictly random. Local: The color of the socks depends only on nearby surroundings—that is, what Bob sees should not depend on Alice’s measurement. Let us now suppose Prof. Bertlmann wishes to teach his snooping students a thing or two about entanglement. The next morning, he puts on a mismatched pair of quantum socks, whose colors are entangled. Prof. Bertlmann complicates the situation by introducing quantum socks—whose color is indeterminate until it’s been observed. When Alice measures the left sock, the pair’s indeterminate state of color collapses, so that Alice sees either pink or blue.Mark Montgomery Unlike his classical socks, Prof. Bertlmann’s entangled quantum socks are: Unreal: The socks have no definite color prior to measurement. Nondeterministic: The color of the socks is random. Measurements under the exact same initial conditions are unpredictable—for example, 50 percent of the time a sock will be pink, 50 percent of the time it will be blue. Nonlocal: The color of each sock is dependent on nonlocal surroundings—that is, what Bob sees depends on Alice’s measurement. In the quantum case, if Alice measures the color of one sock, her measurement instantaneously updates the color of the other sock, which had previously been indefinite. (Note: Because the sock color is random, this does not, strictly speaking, transmit information—and therefore cannot be used for faster-than-light communication.) But, Alice objects, the socks are close together—couldn’t they send some signal to each other? Is the update really instantaneous? To further convince his students that there is something nonlocal happening, Prof. Bertlmann ships each of the socks to distant stars that are light-years apart from one another. Now each of the professor's fabled quantum socks have been sent to different star systems, many light-years apart. As before, when Alice observes the left sock, the pair's indeterminate state of color collapses. This measurement updates the color of the other sock instantaneously. For simplicity, we’ve shown only Alice measuring, but the results do not change if Bob measures too.Mark Montgomery Then he asks Alice and Bob to perform the same experiment. Again, what Bob sees depends on Alice’s measurement, even though there is no way for the socks to communicate. This result should be shocking. As Prof. Bertlmann puts it: “How come they always choose different colors when they are looked at? How does the second sock know what the first has done?” § A brief historical detour: Anxiety about entanglement originates from the famous 1935 EPR paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen (collectively known as EPR, from their initials). EPR recognized that quantum mechanics specified a world that was nondeterministic and nonlocal, and argued that these properties implied that quantum mechanics is incomplete as a theory. Einstein was particularly concerned about the lack of locality. He famously lamented the instantaneous measurement update between entangled particles as “spukhafte Fernwirkung” (“spooky action at a distance”) because he could not reconcile it with the “ideas of physics.” From Einstein’s letters to Max Born: To preserve these reasonable assumptions—and rescue physics from the seemingly irreconcilable weirdness that quantum mechanics introduced—physicists began playing with “hidden-variable theories.” According to hidden-variable theory, in Alice and Bob’s experiment the quantum socks are secretly predetermined (by a “hidden” variable) to be one color or another, and it only seems as though Alice’s measurement of the first sock instantaneously updates the color of the other sock. Hidden-variable theories, it was thought, could reproduce all the odd results quantum mechanics predicted without sacrificing local realism. Here is where we return to the topic of this article—because quantum entanglement lies at the heart of questions about hidden-variable theory. If hidden-variable theories are correct, entanglement is just an illusion of nonlocality; Bertlmann’s quantum socks would not in that case actually have a strange connection irrespective of distance. But if hidden-variable theories are wrong, entanglement really does link the socks no matter how far apart they are. Without any way of experimentally differentiating between either theory, physicists relegated the conundrum to the realm of philosophy—until Bell, the Northern Irish physicist referenced earlier, found a solution. § Back to the present day, where the skeptical students Alice and Bob are unimpressed by Prof. Bertlmann’s supposedly entangled socks. Again, from their perspective, there is no experimental difference between “spooky” socks and hidden-variable socks, which only appear to update each other upon measurement but whose color (according to hidden-variable theory) would actually be preordained. To enlighten his mistrustful mentees about the true nature of entanglement, Prof. Bertlmann sets up a new experiment. In this experiment, Alice and Bob fly off in spaceships. A source shoots out entangled pairs of quantum socks toward them. Alice and Bob each have special detectors with two settings. Alice’s detector can be in setting A or setting a; Bob’s detector can be set to either setting B or setting b. (To pick a setting, they each flip a coin after the socks are sent so there is no way the socks know the settings ahead of time.) To avoid any possible local effects, Alice and Bob fly light-years apart. They want this isolation so that they can tell if the sock color is predetermined or really updates upon measurement. When Alice and Bob have different settings (a and B, or A and b), the socks sometimes match and sometimes mismatch. When Alice and Bob share the same settings (A and B, or a and b), the socks always match. How could predetermined socks manage this correlation, if the random coin flip happened after the socks were sent?Mark Montgomery Here is a sample output from Alice and Bob: As you can see, the colors Alice and Bob measure are random. Let’s now add the detector settings, which are also random. Setting Alice Setting Bob A P b B A B B B a B b B A B B B a B B P a B b B A P B P A P b B a P B P A B B B a B B P a P b P a B b B A P b B A B B B a B B B A P b P a P B P The table shows that when Alice and Bob use different settings, the socks sometimes match and sometimes mismatch. But if Alice and Bob share a setting (both uppercase or both lowercase), they always match. It’s as if, despite the fact that Alice and Bob flipped coins after the socks were sent, the socks could somehow tell each other when to match across the vast distance. This is very strange—as if the sock color were predetermined! After Alice and Bob have recorded all their data, they come back to Earth, where Prof. Bertlmann explains that the strange coincidence is not quite enough to reveal the true nature of entanglement. What they need is to measure how correlated the socks are, so Alice and Bob create a new table where pinks are -1 and blues are +1. Setting Alice Setting Bob Combined Setting Sum A -1 b +1 Ab 0 A +1 B +1 AB 2 a +1 b +1 ab 2 A +1 B +1 AB 2 a +1 B -1 aB 0 a +1 b +1 ab 2 A -1 B -1 AB -2 A -1 b +1 Ab 0 a -1 B -1 aB -2 A +1 B +1 AB 2 a +1 B -1 aB 0 a -1 b -1 ab -2 a +1 b +1 ab 2 A -1 b +1 Ab 0 A +1 B +1 AB 2 a +1 B +1 aB 2 A -1 b -1 Ab -2 a -1 B -1 aB -2 “There is a very simple proof—that you can check on your own—which states that the absolute value of AB - Ab + aB + ab cannot be greater than 2 if the hidden-variable theory of sock color were true,” Prof. Bertlmann explains. Counting, Alice and Bob tally up their measurements and find the averages for AB, Ab, aB, and ab: Then they plug the numbers into the formula and find that the (positive) sum exceeds 2!

        From the Archives: Xerox Parc’s Engineers on How They Invented the Future
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/xerox-parc,2022-06-04,"And how Xerox lost it An undated exterior view of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) is shown in Palo Alto, California. In late 1969, C. Peter McColough, chairman of Xerox Corp., told the New York Society of Security Analysts that Xerox was determined to develop “the architecture of information” to solve the problems that had been created by the “knowledge explosion.” Legend has it that McColough then turned to Jack E. Goldman, senior vice president of research and development, and said, “All right, go start a lab that will find out what I just meant.” This article was first published as “Inside the PARC: the ‘information architects’.” It appeared in the October 1985 issue of IEEE Spectrum. A PDF version is available on IEEE Xplore. The diagrams and photographs appeared in the original print version. Goldman tells it differently. In 1969 Xerox had just bought Scientific Data Systems (SDS), a mainframe computer manufacturer. “When Xerox bought SDS,” he recalled, “I walked promptly into the office of Peter McColough and said, ‘Look, now that we’re in this digital computer business, we better damned well have a research laboratory!’ ” In any case, the result was the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in California, one of the most unusual corporate research organizations of our time. PARC is one of three research centers within Xerox; the other two are in Webster, N.Y., and Toronto, Ont., Canada. It employs approximately 350 researchers, managers, and support staff (by comparison, Bell Laboratories before the AT&T breakup employed roughly 25,000). PARC, now in its 15th year, originated or nurtured technologies that led to these developments, among others: In the mid-1970s, close to half of the top 100 computer scientists in the world were working at PARC, and the laboratory boasted similar strength in other fields, including solid-state physics and optics. Some researchers say PARC was a product of the 1960s and that decade’s philosophy of power to the people, of improving the quality of life. When the center opened in 1970, it was unlike other major industrial research laboratories; its work wasn’t tied, even loosely, to its corporate parent’s current product lines. And unlike university research laboratories, PARC had one unifying vision: it would develop “the architecture of information.” IEEE Spectrum Research projects at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, represented on this family tree by heart-encircled carvings surrounded by the initials of some of their key developers, had their roots in many places, including projects funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (the ARPAnet), the University of Utah (Flex), and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Sketchpad). The ideas developed at PARC found their way into a number of commercial products, companies, and publications, shown here as leafy branches. Some of these real-world offspring, like the Apple Lisa computer and the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer, took many of their root concepts from PARC; others, like the Ada computer language and the Intel 1103 dynamic RAM chip, are less closely related. As for the future impact of PARC research—the sky’s the limit. The originator of that phrase is unclear. McColough has credited his speechwriter. The speechwriter later said that neither he nor McColough had a specific definition of the phrase. So almost everyone who joined PARC in its formative years had a different idea of what the center’s charter was. This had its advantages. Since projects were not assigned from above, the researchers formed their own groups; support for a project depended on how many people its instigator could get to work on it. “The phrase was ‘Tom Sawyering,’ ” recalled James G. Mitchell, who joined PARC from the defunct Berkeley Computer Corp. in 1971 and is now vice president of research at the Acorn Research Centre in Palo Alto. “Someone would decide that a certain thing was really important to do. They would start working on it, give some structure to it, and then try to convince other people to come whitewash this fence with them.” When Goldman set up PARC, one of his first decisions was to ask George E. Pake, a longtime friend, to run it. Pake was executive vice chancellor, provost, and professor of physics at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo. One of the first decisions Pake in turn made was to hire, among others, Robert Taylor, then at the University of Utah, to help him recruit engineers and scientists for the Computer Science and Systems Science Laboratories. Taylor had been director of the information-processing techniques office at ARPA (the U.S. military’s Advanced Research Projects Agency), where he and others had funded the heyday of computer research in the mid- and late 1960s. PARC started with a small nucleus—perhaps fewer than 20 people. Nine came from the Berkeley Computer Corp., a small mainframe computer company that Taylor had tried to convince Xerox to buy as a way of starting up PARC. (Many of the people at BCC were responsible for the design of the SDS 940, the computer on the strength of which Xerox bought Scientific Data Systems in 1968.) The 20 PARC employees were housed in a small, rented building, “with rented chairs, rented desks, a telephone with four buttons on it, and no receptionist,” recalled David Thornburg, who joined PARC’s General Science Laboratory fresh out of graduate school in 1971. The group thought it should have a computer of its own. “It’s a little hard to do language research and compiler research without having a machine,” said Mitchell. The computer they wanted was a PDP-10 from Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC). “There was a rivalry in Datamation [magazine] advertisements between Xerox’s SDS and DEC,” recalled Alan Kay, who came to PARC as a researcher from Stanford University’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in late 1970. “When we wanted a PDP-10, Xerox envisioned a photographer lining up a shot of DEC boxes going into the PARC labs, so they said, ‘How about a Sigma 7?’ “We decided it would take three years to do a good operating system for a Sigma 7, while we could build an entire PDP-10 in just one year.”  The result was MAXC (Multiple Access Xerox Computer), which emulated the PDP-10 but used semiconductor dynamic RAMs instead of core. So much care was lavished on MAXC’s hardware and software that it held the all-time record for continuous availability as a node on the ARPAnet. MAXC was crucial to a number of developments. The Intel Corp., which had made the 1,103 dynamic memory chips used in the MAXC design, reaped one of the first benefits. “Most of the 1,103 memory chips you bought from Intel at the time didn’t work,” recalled Kay. So PARC researcher Chuck Thacker built a chip-tester to screen chips for MAXC. A later version of that tester, based on an Alto personal computer, also developed at PARC, ended up being used by Intel itself on its production line. And MAXC gave PARC experience in building computers that would later stand the center in good stead. “There were three capabilities we needed that we could not get if we bought a PDP-10,” recalled an early PARC lab manager. “We needed to develop a vendor community—local people who would do design layouts, printed-circuit boards, and so forth—and the only way to get that is to drive it with a project. We also needed semiconductor memory, which PDP-10s did not have. And we thought we needed to learn more about microprogrammable machines, although it turned out we didn’t use those features.” Bit map

 MAXC set a pattern for PARC: building its own hardware. That committed its researchers to visions that must be turned into reality—at least on a small scale. “One of the blood oaths that was taken by the original founders was that we would never do a system that wasn’t engineered for 100 users,” said Kay. “That meant that if it was a time-sharing system, you had to run 100 people on it; if it was a programming language, 100 people had to program in it without having their hands constantly held. If it was a personal computer, you had to be able to build 100.” This policy of building working systems is not the only way of doing research; Mitchell recalled that it was a bone of contention at PARC. “Systems research requires building systems,” he said. “Otherwise you don’t know whether the ideas you have are any good, or how difficult they are to implement. But there are people who think that when you are building things you are not doing research.” Since MAXC, the center has built prototypes of dozens of hardware and software systems—prototypes that sometimes numbered in the thousands of units. Alan Kay, whose “Smalltalk” group created overlapping windows, is perhaps PARC’s most famous alumnus. After spending 10 years at PARC, he became chief scientist at Atari Inc. and is now a fellow at Apple Computer Inc. The first personal computer developed in the United States is commonly thought to be the MITS Altair, which sold as a hobbyist’s kit in 1976. At nearly the same time the Apple I became available, also in kit form. But by the end of that year there were also 200 Alto personal computers in daily use—the first of them having been built in 1973. While researchers in PARC’s Computer Science Laboratory were completing the MAXC and beginning to use it, their counterparts in the Systems Science Laboratory were putting together a distributed­ computer system using Nova 800 processors and a high-speed character generator.  In September 1972, researchers Butler Lampson and Chuck Thacker of PARC’s Computer Science Laboratory went to Alan Kay in the Systems Science Laboratory and asked, “Do you have any money?” Kay told them that he had about US $250,000 earmarked for more Nova 800s and character-generation hardware. “How would you like us to build you a computer?” Lampson asked Kay. “I’d like it a lot,” Kay replied. And on Nov. 22, 1972, Thacker and Ed McCreight began building what was to become the Alto. A Xerox executive reportedly angered Thacker by insisting that it would take 18 months to develop a major hardware system. When Thacker argued that he could do it in three months, a bet was placed. It took a little longer than three months, but not much. On April 1, 1973, Thornburg recalled, “I walked into the basement where the prototype Alto was sitting, with its umbilical cord attached to a rack full of Novas, and saw Ed McCreight sitting back in a chair with the little words, ‘Alto lives’ in the upper left corner of the display screen.” Kay said the Alto turned out to be “a vector sum of what Lampson wanted, what Thacker wanted, and what I wanted. Lampson wanted a $500 PDP-10,” he recalled. “Thacker wanted a 10-times-faster Nova 800, and I wanted a machine that you could carry around and children could use.” The reason the Alto could be built so quickly was its simplicity. The processor, recalled Kay, “was hardly more than a clock”—only 160 chips in 1973’s primitive integrated circuit technology. The architecture goes back to the TX-2, built with 32 program counters at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Lincoln Laboratories in the late 1950s. The Alto, which had 16 program counters, would fetch its next instruction from whichever counter had the highest priority at any given moment. Executing multiple tasks incurred no overhead. While the machine was painting the screen display, the dynamic memory was being refreshed every 2 milliseconds, the keyboard was being monitored, and information was being transferred to and from the disk. The task of lowest priority was running the user’s program. In 1973 every researcher at PARC wanted an Alto personal computer, but there weren’t enough to go around. To speed things up, researchers dropped into the Alto laboratory whenever they had a few free moments to help with computer assembly. The prototype was a success, and more Altos were built. Research on user interfaces, computer languages, and graphics began in earnest. Lampson, Thacker, and other instigators of the project got the first models. Many PARC researchers pitched in to speed up the production schedules, but there never seemed to be enough Altos. “There was a lab where the Altos were getting built, with circuit boards lying around, and anyone could go in and work on them,” recalled Daniel H.H. Ingalls, now a principal engineer at Apple Computer Inc., Cupertino, Calif. Ron Rider, who is still with Xerox, “had an Alto when Altos were impossible to get,” recalled Bert Sutherland, who joined PARC in 1975 as manager of the Systems Science Laboratory. “When I asked him how he got one, he told me that he went around to the various laboratories, collected parts that people owed him, and put it together himself.” By today’s standards the Alto was not a particularly powerful computer. But if several Altos are linked, along with file servers and printers, the result looks suspiciously like the office of the future. The idea of a local computer network had been discussed before PARC was founded—in 1966, at Stanford University. Larry Tesler, now manager of object-oriented systems at Apple, who had graduated from Stanford, was still hanging around the campus when the university was considering buying an IBM 360 time-sharing system. “One of the guys and I proposed that instead they buy 100 PDP-1s and link them together in a network,” Tesler said. “Some of the advisors thought that was a great idea; a consultant from Yale, Alan Perlis, told them that was what they ought to do, but the IBM-oriented people at Stanford thought it would be safer to buy the time-sharing system. They missed the opportunity to invent local networking.” So PARC ended up with another first. At the same time that the Alto was being built, Thacker conceived of the Ethernet, a coaxial cable that would link machines in the simplest possible fashion. It was based in part on the Alohanet, a packet radio network developed at the University of Hawaii in the late 1960s. “Thacker made the remark that coaxial cable is nothing but captive ether,” said Kay. “So that part of it was already set before Robert Metcalfe and David Boggs came on board—that it would be packet-switching and that it would be a collision-type network. But then Metcalfe and Boggs sweated for a year to figure out how to do the damn thing.” (Metcalfe later founded 3Com Corp., in Mountain View, Calif.; Boggs is now with DEC Western Research, in Los Altos, Calif. The two of them hold the basic patents on the Ethernet.) “I’ve always thought the fact that [David] Boggs was a ham radio operator was important.... [He] knew that you could communicate reliably through an unreliable medium. I’ve often wondered what would have happened if he hadn’t had that background.”—Bert Sutherland “I’ve always thought the fact that Boggs was a ham radio operator was important,” Sutherland said. “It had a great impact on the way the Ethernet was designed, because the Ethernet fundamentally doesn’t work reliably. It’s like citizens’ band radio, or any of the other kinds of radio communication, which are fundamentally not reliable in the way that we think of the telephone. Because you know it basically doesn’t work, you do all the defensive programming—the ‘say again, you were garbled’ protocols that were worked out for radio communication. And that makes the resulting network function extremely reliably.” “Boggs was a ham and knew that you could communicate reliably through an unreliable medium. I’ve often wondered what would have happened if he hadn’t had that background,” Sutherland added. Once the Ethernet was built, using it was fairly simple: A computer that wanted to send a message would wait and see whether the cable was clear. If it was, the machine would send the information in a packet prefaced with the address of its recipient. If two messages collided, the machines that sent them would each wait for a random interval before trying again. One innovative use for the network had nothing to do with people sending messages to one another; it involved communication solely between machines. Because the dynamic memory chips were so unreliable in those days, the Alto also ran a memory check when it wasn’t doing anything else. Its response to finding a bad chip was remarkable: “It would send a message telling which Alto was bad, which slot had the bad board, and which row and column had the bad chips,” Thornburg said. “The reason I found out about this was that one day the repairman showed up and said, ‘Any time you’re ready to power down, I need to fix your Alto,’ and I didn’t even know anything was wrong.” While the Ethernet was being developed, so was another crucial element in the office of the future: the laser printer. After all, what use was a screen that could show documents in multiple type styles and a network that could transmit them from place to place without some means of printing them efficiently? The idea for the laser printer came to PARC from Xerox’s Webster, N.Y., research laboratory—along with its proponent, Gary Starkweather. He had the idea of using a laser to paint information, in digital form, onto the drum or belt of a copying machine, then-research vice president Goldman recalled. Starkweather reported to the vice president of the Business Products Group for Advanced Development, George White. “George White came to me,” said Goldman, “and said, ‘Look, Jack, I got a terrific guy named Gary Starkweather doing some exciting things on translating visual information to print by a laser, using a Xerox machine, of course. What an ideal concept that would be for Xerox. But I don’t think he’s going to thrive in Rochester; nobody’s going to listen to him, they’re not going to do anything that far advanced. Why don’t you take him out to your new lab in Palo Alto?’ ” Newly appointed PARC manager Pake jumped at the opportunity. Starkweather and a few other researchers from Rochester were transferred to Palo Alto and started PARC’s Optical Science Laboratory. The first laser printer, EARS (Ethernet-Alto-Research character generator-Scanning laser output terminal), built by Starkweather and Ron Rider, began printing documents that were generated by Altos and sent to it via Ethernet in 1973. EARS wasn’t perfect, Thornburg said. It had a dynamic character generator that would create new patterns for characters and graphics as they came in. If a page had no uppercase Qs in it, the character generator would economize on internal memory by not generating a pattern for a capital “Q.” But if a page contained a very complex picture, the character generator would run out of space for patterns; “there were certain levels of complexity in drawings that couldn’t be printed,” Thornburg recalled. Even with these drawbacks, the laser printer was still an enormous advance over the line printers, teletypes, and facsimile printers that were available at the time, and Goldman pushed to have it commercialized as quickly as possible. But Xerox resisted. In fact, a sore point throughout PARC’s history has been the parent organization’s seeming inability to exploit the developments that researchers made. In 1972, when Starkweather built his first prototype, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, in an effort to spur the technology, put out a request for bids for five laser printers. But Goldman was unable to convince the executive to whom Xerox’s Electro-Optical Systems division reported (whose background was accounting and finance) to allow a bid. The reason: Xerox might have lost $150 000 over the life of the contract if the laser printers needed repair as often as the copiers on which they were based, even though initial evidence showed that printing caused far less wear and tear than copying. In 1974 the laser printer first became available outside PARC when a small group of PARC researchers under John Ellenby—who built the Alto II, a production-line version of the Alto, and who is now vice president of development at Grid Systems Corp., Mountain View, Calif.—began buying used copiers from Xerox’s copier division and installing laser heads in them. The resulting printers, known as Dovers, were distributed within Xerox and to universities. Sutherland estimated that several dozen were built. “They stripped out all the optics and turned them back to the copier division for credit,” he recalled. Even today, he said, he receives laser-printed documents from universities in which he can recognize the Dover typefaces. Also in 1974, the Product Review Committee at Xerox head­quarters in Rochester, N.Y., was finally coming to a decision about what kind of computer printer the company should manufacture. “A bunch of horse’s asses who don’t know anything about technology were making the decision, and it looked to me, sitting a week before the election, that it was going toward CRT technology,” said Goldman. (Another group at Xerox had developed a printing system whereby text displayed on a special cathode ray tube would be focused on a copier drum and printed.) “It was Monday night. I commandeered a plane,” Goldman recalled. “I took the planning vice president and the marketing vice president by the ear, and I said, ‘You two guys are coming with me. Clear your Tuesday calendars. You are coming with me to PARC tonight. We’ll be back for the 8:30 meeting on Wednesday morning.’ We left around 7:00 p.m., got to California at 1:00, which is only 10:00 their time, and the guys at PARC, bless their souls, did a beautiful presentation showing what the laser printer could do.” “If you’re dealing with marketing or planning people, make them kick the tires. All the charts and all the slides aren’t worth a damn,” Goldman said. From a purely economic standpoint, Xerox’s investment in PARC for its first decade was returned with interest by the profits from the laser printer.  The committee opted to go with laser technology, but there were delays. “They wouldn’t let us get them out on 7000s,” Goldman said, referring to the old-model printer that Ellenby’s group had used as a base. “Instead they insisted on going with new 9000 Series, which didn’t come out until 1977.” From a purely economic standpoint, Xerox’s investment in PARC for its first decade was returned with interest by the profits from the laser printer. This is perhaps ironic, since one vision of the office of the future was that it would be paperless. “I think PARC has generated more paper than any other office by far, because at the press of a button you can print 30 copies of any report,” observed Douglas Fairbairn, a former PARC technician and now vice president for user-designed technology at VLSI Technology Inc. “If the report is 30 pages long, that’s 1000 pages, but it still takes only a few minutes. Then you say, ‘I guess I wanted that picture on the other page.’ That’s another 1000 pages.” By the mid-1970s the Altos in the offices of most PARC re­searchers had been customized to their tastes. Richard Shoup’s Alto had a color display. Taylor’s Alto had a speaker—which played “The Eyes of Texas Are Upon You” whenever he received an electronic mail message. And, as many people have found in the 10 years since the Alto became widespread at PARC, personal computers can be used for enjoyment as well as work. The PARC researchers were among the first to discover this. “At night, whenever I was in Palo Alto,” Goldman said, “I’d go over to the laboratory and watch Alan Kay invent a game. This was long before electronic games, and these kids were inventing these things all the time until midnight, 1:00 a.m.” “Xerox had the first electronic raffle nationwide. At Xerox, I received my first electronic junk mailing, first electronic job acceptance, and first electronic obituary.”—Bert Sutherland “l enjoyed observing a number of firsts,” Sutherland said. “Xerox had the first electronic raffle nationwide. At Xerox, I received my first electronic junk mailing, first electronic job acceptance, and first electronic obituary.” When the Xerox 914 copiers came out in the early 1960s, “I was a copy freak,” said Lynn Conway who joined PARC from Memorex Corp. in 1973 and is now associate dean and professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “I liked to make things and give them out, like maps—all kinds of things. And in the Xerox environment in ’76, all of a sudden you could create things and make lots of them.” Dozens of clubs and interest groups were started that met on the network. Whatever a PARC employee’s hobby or interest, he or she could find someone with whom to share that interest electronically. Much serious work got done electronically as well: reports, articles, sometimes entire design projects were done through the network. One side effect of all this electronic communication was a disregard for appearances and other external trappings of status. “People at PARC have a tendency to have very strong personalities, and sometimes in design sessions those personalities came over a little more strongly than the technical content,” said John Warnock, who joined PARC in 1978 from the Evans & Sutherland Corp., where he worked on high-speed graphics systems. Working via electronic mail eliminated the personality problems during design sessions. Electronic interaction was particularly useful for soft­ware researchers, who could send code back and forth. Warnock, who is now president of Adobe Systems Inc., Palo Alto, Calif., described the design of lnterpress, a printing protocol: “One of the designers was in Pittsburgh, one of them was in Philadelphia, there were three of us in this area, and a couple in El Segundo [Calif.]. The design was done almost completely over the mail system, remotely; there were only two occasions when we all got together in the same room.” Electronic mail was also invaluable for keeping track of group projects. “One of the abilities that is really useful is to save a sequence of messages on a particular subject so that you can refer to it,” said Warren Teitelman, who joined PARC in 1972 from BBN Inc. and is currently manager of programming environments at Sun Microsystems in Mountain View. “Or if somebody comes into a discussion late and they don’t have the context, you can bring them up to date by sending them all the messages,” Teitelman added. But electronic mail sometimes got out of hand at PARC. Once, after Teitelman had been out of touch for a week, he logged onto the system and found 600 messages in his mailbox. Antialiasing—removing jagged edges from diagonal lines and curves—is a standard technique in computer graphics today. These pictures, produced by Superpaint at PARC in 1972, were among the first demonstrations of antialiasing. 
	As anyone who has sat through a business meeting knows, the office of today includes graphics as well as text. In 1970, Shoup, who is now chairman of Aurora Systems Inc., started working at PARC on new ways to create and manipulate images digitally in the office of the future. His research started the field of television graphics and won Emmy awards for both him and Xerox.
 
	“It quickly became clear that if we wanted to do a raster scan system, we ought to do it compatible with television standards so that we could easily obtain monitors and cameras and videotape recorders,” Shoup recalled. In early 1972 he built some simple hardware to generate antialiased lines, and by early 1973 the system, called Superpaint, was completed.
 
	It was the first complete paint system with an 8-bit frame buffer anywhere, recalled Alvy Ray Smith, who worked with Superpaint at PARC and is soon to be vice president and chief technical officer of Pixar Inc., San Rafael, Calif.; it was also the first system to use several graphics aids: color lookup tables for simple animation, a digitizing tablet for input, a palette for mixing colors directly on the screen. The system also had a real-time video scanner so images of real objects could be digitized and then manipulated.
 
	“The very first thing I did on the system was some antialiased lines and circles,” Shoup said, “because I’d written a paper on that subject and hadn’t finished the examples. But when I submitted the paper and had it accepted, the machine that was going to be used to do the examples wasn’t built yet.”
 
	By mid-1974, Superpaint had been augmented by additional software that allowed it to perform all kinds of tricks, and Smith, who had just completed doctoral work in a branch of mathematics known as cellular automata theory, was hired to help put the machine through its paces. He used Superpaint to make a videotape called “Vidbits” that was later shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Six months later his initial contract with PARC expired and was not renewed. While disappointed, Smith was not surprised, as he had found that not everyone there shared his enthusiasm for painting with a computer.
 
	“The color graphics lab was a long narrow room with seven doors into it,” he recalled. “You had to go through it to get to a lot of other places. Most people, when they walked through, would look at the screen and stop—even the most trite stuff had never been seen before. Cycling color maps had never been seen before. But there were some people who would go through and wouldn’t stop. I couldn’t figure out how people could walk through that room and never stop and look.”
 
	A reason aside from others’ indifference to video graphics may have contributed to Smith’s departure. One of the first times Superpaint was seen by a wide audience was in a public television show, “Supervisions,” produced by station KCET in Los Angeles. “It was just used a couple of times for little color cycling effects,” Shoup recalled. But Xerox was not amused by the unauthorized use of the system in a program.
 
	“Bob Taylor sat with Alvy [Smith] one entire afternoon while Alvy pushed the erase button on the videotape recorder, eliminating the Xerox logo from every copy of that tape,” Shoup continued. (This was one of the tapes viewed by the committee that awarded Xerox its Emmy.)
 
	It was the first system to use...color lookup tables for simple animation, a digitizing tablet for input, [and] a palette for mixing colors directly on the screen.
 
	Shoup stayed at PARC, supported by Kay’s research group, while Smith moved on, armed with a National Education Association grant to do computer art. He found support for his work at the New York Institute of Technology, where he helped develop Paint, which became the basis of Ampex Video Art (AVA), and N.Y. Tech’s Images, two graphics systems still in use today.
 
	While Shoup was alone in pursuing Superpaint at PARC, Smith wasn’t the only Superpaint addict wandering the country in search of a frame buffer. David Miller, now known as David Em, and David Difrancesco were the first artists to paint with pixels. When Em lost access to Superpaint, he set out on a year-long quest for a frame buffer that finally brought him to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
 
	Finally, in 1979, Shoup left PARC to start his own company to manufacture and market a paint system, the Aurora 100. He ac­knowledges that he made no technological leaps in designing the Aurora, which is simply a commercialized second-generation version of his first-generation system at PARC.
 
	“The machine we’re building at Aurora for our next generation is directly related to things we were thinking about seven or eight years ago at PARC,” Shoup said.
 
	The Aurora 100 is now used by corporations to develop in­ house training films and presentation graphics. Today, tens of thousands of artists are painting with pixels. The 1985 Siggraph art show in San Francisco alone received 4000 entries.
 Most people who know that a mouse is a computer peripheral think it was invented by Apple. The cognoscenti will correct them by saying that it was developed at Xerox PARC. But the mouse in fact preceded PARC. “I saw a demonstration of a mouse being used as a pointing device in 1966,” Tesler recalled. “Doug Engelbart [of SRI International Inc. in Menlo Park, Calif.] invented it.” At PARC, Tesler set out to prove that the mouse was a bad idea. “I really didn’t believe in it,” he said. “I thought cursor keys were much better. “We literally took people off the streets who had never seen a computer. In three or four minutes they were happily editing away, using the cursor keys. At that point I was going to show them the mouse and prove they could select text faster than with the cursor keys. Then I was going to show that they didn’t like it. “It backfired. I would have them spend an hour working with the cursor keys, which got them really used to the keys. Then I would teach them about the mouse. They would say, ‘That’s interesting but I don’t think I need it.’ Then they would play with it a bit, and after two minutes they never touched the cursor keys again.” “While I didn’t mind using a mouse for text manipulation, I thought it was totally inappropriate for drawing. People stopped drawing with rocks in Paleolithic times.”—David Thornburg After Tesler’s experiment, most PARC researchers accepted the mouse as a proper peripheral for the Alto. One holdout was Thornburg. “I didn’t like the mouse,” he said. “It was the least reliable component of the Alto. I remember going into the repair room at PARC-where there was a shoebox to hold good mice and a 5O-gallon drum for bad mice. And it was expensive—too expensive for the mass market. “While I didn’t mind using a mouse for text manipulation, I thought it was totally inappropriate for drawing. People stopped drawing with rocks in Paleolithic times, and there’s a reason for that: rocks aren’t appropriate drawing implements; people moved on to sticks.” Thornburg, a metallurgist who had been doing materials re­search at PARC, began work on alternative pointing devices. He came up with a touch tablet in 1977 and attached it to an Alto. Most people who looked at it said, “That’s nice, but it’s not a mouse,” Thornburg recalls. His touch tablet did eventually find its way into a product: the Koalapad, a home-computer peripheral costing less than $100. “It was clear that Xerox didn’t want to do anything with it,” Thornburg said. “They didn’t even file for patent protection, so I told them that I’d like to have it. After a lot of horsing around, they said OK.” Thornburg left Xerox in 1981, worked at Atari for a while, then started a company—now Koala Technologies Inc.—with another ex-PARC employee to manufacture and market the Koalapad. Meanwhile, though Tesler accepted the need for a mouse as a pointing device, he wasn’t satisfied with the way SRI’s mouse worked. “You had a five-key keyset for your left hand and a mouse with three buttons for your right hand. You would hit one or two keys with the left hand, then point at something with the mouse with the right hand, and then you had more buttons on the mouse for confirming your commands. It took six to eight keystrokes to do a command, but you could have both hands going at once. Experts could go very fast.” The SRI system was heavily moded. In a system with modes, the user first indicates what he wants to do—delete, for example. This puts the system in the delete mode. The computer then waits for the user to indicate what he wants deleted. If the user changes his mind and tries to do something else, he can’t unless he first cancels the delete command. In a modeless system, the user first points to the part of the dis­play he wants to change, then indicates what should be done to it. He can point at things all day, constantly changing his mind, and never have to follow up with a command. To make things even more complicated for the average user (but more efficient for programmers), the meaning of each key varied, depending on the mode the system was in. For example, “J” meant scroll and “I” meant insert. If the user tried to “insert,” then to “scroll” without canceling the first command, he would end up inserting the letter “J” in the text. Larry Tesler set out to test the interface on a nonprogrammer.... Apparently nobody had done that before. Most programmers at PARC liked the SRI system and began adapting it in their projects. “There was a lot of religion around that this was the perfect user interface,” said Tesler. “Anytime anybody would suggest changing it, they were greeted with glares.”  Being programmers, they had no trouble with the fact that the keypad responded to combinations of keys pressed simultaneously that represented the alphabet in binary notation. Tesler set out to test the interface on a nonprogrammer. He taught a newly hired secretary how to work the machine and observed her learning process. “Apparently nobody had done that before,” he said. “She had a lot of trouble with the mouse and the keyset.” Tesler argued for a simpler user interface. “Just about the only person who agreed with me was Alan Kay,” he said. Kay supported Tesler’s attempt to write a modeless text editor on the Alto. Although most popular computers today use modeless soft­ware, with the Macintosh being probably the best example, Tesler’s experiments didn’t settle the issue. “MacWrite, Microsoft Word, and the Xerox Star all started out as projects that were heavily moded,” Tesler said, “because programmers couldn’t believe that a user interface could be flexible and useful and extensible unless it had a lot of modes. The proof that this wasn’t so didn’t come by persuasion, it came through customers complaining that they liked a dinky modeless editor with no features better than the one that had all the features they couldn’t figure out how to use.” The same kinds of simplification that made for the modeless editor were also applied to programming languages and environments at PARC. Seeking a language that children could use, Kay could regularly be seen testing his work with kindergarten and elementary-school pupils. What Kay aimed for was the Dynabook: a simple, portable personal computer that would cater to a person’s information needs and provide an outlet for creativity-writing, drawing, and music composition. Smalltalk was to be the language of the Dynabook. It was based on the concepts of classes pioneered in the programming language Simula, and on the idea of interacting objects communicating by means of messages requesting actions, rather than by programs performing operations directly on data. The first version of Smalltalk was written as the result of a chance conversation between Kay, Ingalls, and Ted Kaehler, another PARC researcher. Ingalls and Kaehler were thinking about writing a language, and Kay said, “You can do one on just one page.” What Kay aimed for was the Dynabook: a simple, portable personal computer. He explained, “If you look at a Lisp interpreter written in itself, the kernel of these things is incredibly small. Smalltalk could be even smaller than Lisp.” The problem with this approach, Kay recalled, is that “Smalltalk is doubly recursive: you’re in the function before you ever do anything with the arguments.” In Smalltalk-72, the first version of the language, control was passed to the object as soon as possible. Thus writing a concise definition of Smalltalk-in Small­ talk-was very difficult. “It took about two weeks to write 10 lines of code,” Kay said, “and it was very hard to see whether those 10 lines of code would work.” Kay spent the two weeks thinking from 4:00 to 8:00 a.m. each day and then discussing his ideas with Ingalls. When Kay was done, Ingalls coded the first Smalltalk in Basic on the Nova 800, because that was the only language available at the time with decent debugging facilities. “Smalltalk was of a scale that you could go out and have a pitcher of beer or two and come back, and then two people would egg each other on and do an entire system in an afternoon.”—Alan Kay Because the language was so small and simple, developing programs and even entire systems was also quite fast. “Smalltalk was of a scale that you could go out and have a pitcher of beer or two and come back, and then two people would egg each other on and do an entire system in an afternoon,” Kay said. From one of those afternoon sessions came overlapping windows. The concept of windows had originated in Sketchpad, an interactive graphics program developed by Ivan Sutherland at MIT in the early 1960s; the Evans & Sutherland Corp. had implemented multiple windows on a graphics machine in the mid-1960s. But the first multiple overlapping windows were implemented on the Alto by PARC’s Diana Merry in 1973. “All of us thought that the Alto display was incredibly small,” said Kay, “and it’s clear that you’ve got to have overlapping windows if you don’t have a large display.” After windows came the concept of Bitblt—block transfers of data from one portion of memory to another, with no restrictions about alignment on word boundaries. Thacker, the main designer of the Alto computer, had implemented a function called CharacterOp to write characters to the Alto’s bit-mapped screen, and Ingalls extended that work to make a general graphic utility. Bitblt made overlapping windows much simpler, and it also made possible all kinds of graphics and animation tricks. “I gave a demo in early 1975 to all of PARC of the Smalltalk system using Bitblt for menus and overlapping windows and things,” Ingalls recalled. “A bunch of people came to me after­wards, saying ‘How do you do all these things? Can I get the code for Bitblt?’ and within two months those things were being used throughout PARC.” Flashy and impressive as it was, Smalltalk-72 “was a dead end,” Tesler said. “It was ambiguous. You could read a piece of code and not be able to tell which were the nouns and which were the verbs. You couldn’t make it fast, and it couldn’t be compiled.” The first compiled version of Smalltalk, written in 1976, marked the end of the emphasis on a language that children could use. The language was now “a mature programming environment,” Ingalls said. “We got interested in exporting it and making it widely available.” “It’s terrible that Smalltalk-80 can’t be used by children, since that’s who Smalltalk was intended for. It fell back into data-structure-type programming instead of simulation-type programming.”—Alan Kay The next major revision of Smalltalk was Smalltalk-80. Kay was no longer on the scene to argue that any language should be simple enough for a child to use. Smalltalk-80, says Tesler, went too far in the opposite direction from the earliest versions of Smalltalk: “It went to such an extreme to make it compilable, uniform, and readable, that it actually became hard to read, and you definitely wouldn’t want to teach it to children.” Kay, looking at Smalltalk-80, said, “It’s terrible that it can’t be used by children, since that’s who Smalltalk was intended for. It fell back into data-structure-type programming instead of simulation-type programming.” While Kay’s group was developing a language for children of all ages, a group of artificial-intelligence researchers within PARC were improving Lisp. Lisp was brought to PARC by Warren Teitelman and Daniel G. Bobrow from Bolt, Beranek, and Newman in Cambridge, Mass., where it was being developed as a service to the ARPA community. At PARC, it was renamed Interlisp, a window system called VLISP was added, and a powerful set of programmers’ tools was developed. In PARC’s Computer Science Laboratory, researchers were developing a powerful language for systems programming. After going through several iterations, the language emerged as Mesa—a modular language, which allowed several programmers to work on a large project at the same time. The key to this is the concept of an interface—what a module in a program does, rather than how it does it. Each programmer knows what the other modules are chartered to do and can call on them to perform their particular functions. Another dominant feature was Mesa’s strong type-checking, which prevented programmers from using integer variables where they needed real numbers, or real numbers where they needed character strings—and prevented bugs from spreading from one module of a program to another. These concepts have since been widely adopted as the basis of modular programming languages. “A lot of the ideas in Ada [the standard programming language of the U.S. Department of Defense] and Modula-2 came out of the programming language research done at PARC,” said Chuck Geschke, now executive vice president of Adobe Systems Inc. Modula-2, in fact, was written by computer scientist Niklaus Wirth after he spent a sabbatical at PARC. While PARC may have had more than its share of successes, like any organization it couldn’t escape some failures. The one most frequently cited by former PARC researchers is Polos. Polos was an alternate approach to distributed computing. While Thacker and McCreight were designing the Alto, another group at PARC was working with a cluster of 12 Data General Novas, attempting to distribute functions among the machines so that one machine would handle editing, one would handle input and output, another would handle filing. “With Altos,” Sutherland said, “everything each person needed was put in each machine on a small scale. Polos was an attempt to slice the pie in a different way-to split up offices functionally.” By the time Polos was working, the Alto computers were proliferating throughout PARC, so Polos was shut down. But it had an afterlife: Sutherland distributed the 12 Novas among other Xerox divisions, where they served as the first remote gateways onto PARC’s Alto network, and the Polos displays were used as terminals within PARC until they were junked in 1977. Another major PARC project that failed was a combination optical character reader and facsimile machine. The idea was to develop a system that could take printed pages of mixed text and graphics, recognize the text as such and transmit the characters in their ASCII code, then send the rest of the material using the less-efficient facsimile coding method. “It was fabulously complicated and fairly crazy,” said Charles Simonyi, now manager of application development at Microsoft Corp. “On this project they had this incredible piece of hardware that was the equivalent of a 10,000-line Fortran program.” Un­fortunately, the equivalent of tens of thousands of lines of Fortran in those days meant tens of thousands of individual integrated circuits. “While we made substantial progress at the algorithmic and architecture level,” said Conway, who worked on the OCR project, “it became clear that with the circuit technology at that time it wouldn’t be anywhere near an economically viable thing.” The project was dropped in 1975. Essentially, the PARC researchers worked in an ivory tower for the first five years; while projects were in their infancy, there was little time for much else. But by 1976, with an Alto on every desk and electronic mail a way of life at the center, re­ searchers yearned to see their creations used by friends and neighbors. At that point, Kay recalled, about 200 Altos were in use at PARC and other Xerox divisions; PARC proposed that Xerox market a mass-production version of the Alto: the Alto III. “On Aug. 18, 1976, Xerox turned down the Alto III,” Kay said. So the researchers, rather than turning their project over to a manufacturing division, continued working with the Alto. “That was the reason for our downfall,” said Kay. “We didn’t get rid of the Altos. Xerox management had been told early on that Altos at PARC were like Kleenex; they would be used up in three years and we would need a new set of things 10 times faster. But when this fateful period came along, there was no capital. “We had a meeting at Pajaro Dunes [Calif.] called ‘Let’s burn our disk packs.’ We could sense the second derivative of progress going negative for us,” Kay related. “I really should have gone and grenaded everybody’s disks.” Instead of starting entirely new research thrusts, the PARC employees focused on getting the fruits of their past research projects out the door as products. Every few years the Xerox Corp. has a meeting of all its managers from divisions around the world to discuss where the company may be going. At the 1977 meeting, held in Boca Raton, Fla., the big event was a demonstration by PARC researchers of the systems they had built. The PARC workers assigned to the Boca Raton presentation put their hearts, souls, and many Xerox dollars into the effort. Sets were designed and built, rehearsals were held on a Holly­ wood sound stage, and Altos and Dovers were shipped between Hollywood and Palo Alto with abandon. It took an entire day to set up the exhibit in an auditorium in Boca Raton, and a special air-conditioning truck had to be rented from the local airport to keep the machines cool. But for much of the Xerox corporate staff, this was the first encounter with the “eggheads” from PARC. “PARC was a very strange place to the rest of the company... It was thought of as weird computer people who had beards, who didn’t bathe or wear shoes, who spent long hours deep into the night staring at their terminals...and who basically were antisocial egg­heads. Frankly, some of us fed that impression.”—Richard Shoup “PARC was a very strange place to the rest of the company,” Shoup said. “It was not only California, but it was nerds. It was thought of as weird computer people who had beards, who didn’t bathe or wear shoes, who spent long hours deep into the night staring at their terminals, who had no relationships with any other human beings, and who basically were antisocial egg­heads. Frankly, some of us fed that impression, as if we were above the rest of the company.” There was some difficulty in getting the rest of Xerox to take PARC researchers and their work seriously. “The presentation went over very well, and the battle was won, but the patient died,” Goldman said. Not only had Xerox executives seen the Alto, the Ethernet, and the laser printer, they had even been shown a Japanese-language word processor. “But the company couldn’t bring them to market!” Goldman said. (By 1983, the company did market a Japanese version of its Star computer.) One reason that Xerox had such trouble bringing PARC’s advances to market was that, until 1976, there was no development organization to take research prototypes from PARC and turn them into products. “At the beginning, the way in which the technology would be transferred was not explicit,” Teitelman said. “We took something of a detached view and assumed that someone was going to pick it up. It wasn’t until later on that this issue got really focused.” The Notetaker, a portable personal computer built at PARC in 1978, is rumored to have been the inspiration for the Osborne I. Even with a development organization, it was an uphill battle to get Xerox executives to accept a product. One example was the Notetaker computer, conceived by Adele Goldberg, a researcher in the Smalltalk group who is currently president of the Associa­tion for Computing Machinery and who is still at PARC. “Poor Adele,” Tesler said. “The rest of us got involved and kept redefining the project.” The Notetaker ended up as an 8086-based computer that could fit under an airplane seat. It was battery-powered, ran Smalltalk, and had a touch-sensitive screen designed by Thornburg. “We had a custom monitor, we had error-corrected memory, a lot of custom engineering that we would normally only do for a real product,” said Fairbairn, the Notetaker’s chief hardware designer. “The last year before I left PARC,” Tesler said, “I spent flying around the country talking to Xerox executives, carrying Note­taker with me. It was the first portable computer run in an air­port. Xerox executives made all sorts of promises: we’ll buy 20,000, just talk to this executive in Virginia, then talk to this executive in Connecticut. The company was so spread out, they never got the meeting together. After a year I was ready to give up.” While Xerox may not have been ready to run with a portable computer, others were. The Osborne I was introduced in 1981, about nine months after Adam Osborne reportedly toured PARC, where pictures of the Notetaker were prominently displayed. While some of PARC’s pioneers were getting restless by the mid-1970s, others were just beginning to find uses for the marvelous tools of the office of the future. One was Lynn Conway, who used the Alto, networks, and laser printers to develop a new method of designing integrated circuits and disseminate the method to hundreds of engineers at several dozen institutions around the country. When Bert Sutherland came in as manager of the Systems Science Laboratory in 1975, he brought Carver Mead, a professor at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, to PARC “to wander in and create some havoc.” Mead was an expert in semi­conductor design who had invented the MESFET in the late 1960s. Sutherland had worked on the application of computer graphics to integrated-circuit layout, Conway recalled, so it was natural for him to think about applying an advanced personal computer like the Alto to the problem of IC design. Conway herself was drawn to integrated-circuit design by the frustration of the OCR-Fax project, in which she had conceived an elegant architecture that could only be realized as racks and racks of equipment. But those racks might become a few chips if only they could be designed by someone who knew what they should do and how they should fit together. “Carver Mead came up and gave a one-week course at PARC on integrated-circuit design,” Fairbairn recalled. “Lynn Conway and I were the ones that really got excited about it and really wanted to do something.” “Then a whole bunch of things really clicked,” said Conway. “While Carver and I were cross-educating each other on what was going on in computing and in devices, he was able to explain some of the basic MOS design methods that had been evolving within Intel. And we began to see ways to generalize the struc­tures that [those designers] had generated.” Instead of working only on computer tools for design, Conway explained, she and Mead worked to make the design methods simpler and to build tools for the refined methods. “Between mid-’75 and mid-’77, things went from a fragmentary little thing—one of a number of projects Bert wanted to get going—to the point where we had it all in hand, with examples, and it was time to write.” In a little less than two years, Carver Mead and Lynn Conway had developed the concepts of scalable design rules, repetitive structures, and the rest of what is now known as structured VLSI design In a little less than two years, Mead and Conway had developed the concepts of scalable design rules, repetitive structures, and the rest of what is now known as structured VLSI design—to the point where they could teach it in a single semester. Today structured VLSI design is taught at more than 100 universities, and thousands of different chips have been built with it. But in the summer of 1977, the Mead-Conway technique was untested—in fact belittled. How could they get it accepted? “The amazing thing about the PARC environment in 1976-77 was the feeling of power; all of a sudden you could create things and make lots of them. Not just one sheet, but whole books,” said Conway. And that is exactly what she and her cohorts did. “We just self-published the thing [Introduction to VLSI Systems],” said Conway, “and put it in a form that if you didn’t look twice, you might think this was a completely sound, proven thing.” It looked like a book, and Addison-Wesley agreed to publish it as a book. Conway insisted it couldn’t have happened without the Altos. “Knowledge would have gotten out in bits and pieces, always muddied and clouded-we couldn’t have generated such a pure form and generated it so quickly.” The one tool Conway used most in the final stages of the VLSI project was networks: not only the Ethernet within PARC, but the ARPAnet that connected PARC to dozens of research sites across the country. “The one thing I am clear of in retrospect,” said Conway, “is the sense of having powerful invisible weapons that people couldn’t understand we had. The environment at PARC gave us the power to outfox and outmaneuver people who would think we were crazy or try to stop us; otherwise we would never have had the nerve to go out with it the way we did.” In 1979, three years after Alan Kay had wanted to throw away the Altos “like Kleenex,” the Dorado, a machine 10 times more powerful, finally saw the light of day. “It was supposed to be built by one of the development organizations because they were going to use it in some of their products,” recalled Severo Ornstein, one of the designers of the Dorado and now chairman of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility in Palo Alto. “But they decided not to do that, so if our lab was going to have it, we were going to have to build it ourselves. We went through a long agonizing period in which none of us who were going to have to do the work really wanted to do it.” “Taylor was running the lab by that time,” Ornstein said. “The whole thing was handled extremely dexterously. He never twisted anyone’s arm really directly; he presided over it and kept order in the process, but he really allowed the lab to figure out that that was what it had to do. It was really a good thing, too, because it was very hard to bring the Dorado to life. A lot of blood was shed.” At first, Ornstein recalled, the designers made a false start by using a new circuit-board technology—so-called multiwire technology, in which individual wires are bonded to a board to make connections. But the Dorado boards were too complex for multiwire technology. When the first Dorado ran, there was a question in many people’s minds whether there would ever be a second. “There Butler Lampson’s faith was important,” Ornstein said. “He was the only one who believed that it could be produced in quantity. In fact, even after the Dorado was redesigned using printed-circuit boards instead of multiwire and Dorados began to be built in quantity, they were still rare. “We never had enough budget to populate the whole community with Dorados,” recalled one former PARC manager. “They dribbled out each year, so that in 1984 still not everybody had a Dorado.” Those who did were envied. “I had a Dorado of my very own,” said John Warnock. “Chuck Geschke was a manager; he didn’t get one.” “In the early days...I got to take my Alto home. But the evolution of machines at Xerox went in the opposite direction from making it easy to take the stuff home.”—Dan Ingalls “I got a crusty old Alto and a sheet of paper,” Geschke said. The advent of the Dorado allowed researchers whose projects were too big for the Alto to make use of bit-mapped displays and all the other advantages of personal computers. “We had tried to put Lisp on the Alto, and it was a disaster,” recalled Teitelman. “When we got the Dorado, we spent eight or nine months dis­ cussing what we would want to see in a programming environ­ment that would combine the best of Mesa, Lisp, and Small­ talk.” The result was Cedar, now commonly acknowledged to be one of the best programming environments anywhere. “Cedar put some of the good features of Lisp into Mesa, like garbage collection and run-time type-checking,” said Mitchell of Acorn. Garbage collection is a process by which memory space that is no longer being used by a program can be reclaimed; run­ time type-checking allows a program to determine the types of its arguments—whether integers, character strings, or floating-point numbers—and choose the operations it performs on them accordingly. Interlisp, the language Teitelman had nurtured for 15 years, also was transported to the Dorado, where it was the basis for a research effort that has now grown into the Intelligent Systems Laboratory at PARC. PARC’s Smalltalk group, who had gotten used to their Altos and then built the Notetaker, another small computer, had some trouble dealing with the Dorados. “In the early days, we had Smalltalk running on an Alto, and I got to take my Alto home,” recalled Ingalls. “But the evolution of machines at Xerox went in the opposite direction from making it easy to take the stuff home. The next machine, the Dolphin, was less transportable, and the Dorado is out of the question—it’s a fire-breathing dragon.” 
	The Dorado was the last major project to be completed by PARC in the 1970s—and the last one nurtured by many of the researchers who had made PARC famous and who in tum had been made famous by the work they did at PARC. For these researchers, it was time to move on.
 
	Alan Kay took a sabbatical beginning in March 1980 and never returned to PARC. Doug Fairbairn, Larry Tesler, and John Ellenby also left that year. In 1981 the exodus continued, with researchers including David Thornburg, Charles Simonyi, and Bert Sutherland packing their knapsacks. By June of 1984, John Warnock, Chuck Geschke, Lynn Conway, Dan Ingalls, Warren Teitelman, and Jim Mitchell had moved on. Bob Taylor had also left, taking a group of researchers with him that included Chuck Thacker and Butler Lampson.
 
	Why the sudden rush for the doors?
 
	There are probably as many reasons as there are people who left PARC. But several common threads emerge—natural career progression, frustration, the playing-out of PARC’s original charter, and a feeling among those who departed that it was time to make room for new blood. PARC hired many of its earliest employees right out of graduate school; they were roughly the same age as one another, and their careers matured along with PARC.
 
	“If you look at a championship football or basketball team,” said Teitelman, “they have somebody sitting on the bench who could start on another team. Those people usually ask to be traded.”
 
	“I saw personal computers happening without us. Xerox no longer seemed like where it was going to happen.”
	—Larry Tesler
 
	But some of those who left PARC recalled that a disillusionment had set in. They hadn’t been frustrated with the progression of their careers; rather, they had been frustrated with the rate of progression of their products into the real world.
 
	“We really wanted to have an impact on the world,” Mitchell said. “That was one reason we built things, that we made real things; we wanted to have a chance of making an impact.”
 
	And the world was finally ready for the PARC researchers, who until the late 1970s had few other places to go to continue the projects they were interested in. But by the early 1980s, other companies were making similar research investments-and bringing the products of that research to the commercial market­place.
 
	“We got very frustrated by seeing things like the Lisa come out,” said Mitchell, “when there were better research prototypes of such systems inside PARC.”
 
	“I saw personal computers happening without us,” said Tesler. “Xerox no longer seemed like where it was going to happen.” Tesler recalls trying to disabuse his colleagues of the notion that only PARC could build personal computers, after he met some Apple engineers.
 
	“Bob Taylor was the guy that kept insisting, ‘We have all the smart people.’ I told him, ‘There are other smart people. There are some at Apple, and I’ll bet there are some at other places, too.’ ”
 
	“‘Hire them,’ he said. I said, ‘We can’t get them all-there are hundreds of them out there, they are all over the place!’ At that moment I decided to leave.” 
	The exodus may have begun in 1980 also because it signified a new decade. Ten years were over, and the researchers had done what they felt they had signed on to do. But, some felt, Xerox had not kept up its end of the bargain-to take their research and develop it into the “office of the future.”
 
	Some look unkindly on this “failure” of Xerox’s. Others are more philosophical.
 
	“One of the worst things that Xerox ever did was to describe something as the office of the future, because if something is the office of the future, you never finish it,” Thornburg said. “There’s never anything to ship, because once it works, it’s the office of today. And who wants to work in the office of today?” The departures may have proved beneficial for PARC’s long­ term growth. Because few researchers left during the 1970s, there was not a great deal of room for hiring new people with new ideas.
 
	“There is something about high technology, an excitement about being right out at the absolute edge and shoving as hard as we can because we can see where the digital revolution is going to go. I can’t imagine it not being exciting somewhere.”
	
	—Alvy Ray Smith
 
	“No biological organism can live in its own waste products,” Kay said. “If you have a closed system, it doesn’t matter how smart a being you have in there, it will eventually suffocate.”
 
	The exodus not only made room for new blood and new ideas within PARC but also turned out to be an efficient method of transferring PARC’s ideas to the outside world, where they have rapidly turned into products.
 
	Meanwhile, back at the lab, new research visions for PARC’s second decade have been seeded. Early efforts in VLSI have expanded, for example, to encompass a full range of fabrication and design facilities. William Spencer, now director of PARC, was the Integrated Circuits Laboratory’s first manager. The laboratory now does experimental fabrication for other areas of PARC and Xerox and is building the processor chips for the Dragon, PARC’s newest personal computer. Collaboration with several universities has led to a kit for integrating new chips into working computer systems.
 
	PARC has also found additional ways of getting products on the market: researchers in the General Science Laboratory in 1984 founded a new company, Spectra Diode Laboratories, with Xerox and Spectra-Physics Inc. funding, to commercialize PARC research on semiconductor lasers.
 
	Perhaps the strongest push in progress at PARC is in artificial intelligence, where the company is marketing Dandelion and Dorado computers that run Interlisp, along with PARC-devel­oped AI tools, including Loops, a software system that lets knowledge-engineers combine rule-based expert systems with object-oriented programming and other useful styles of knowledge representation. Loops, which was developed by three PARC researchers—formed AI Systems Business Unit, a marketing and development organization at PARC.
 
	PARC’s scattered AI groups have been consolidated into the Intelligent Systems Laboratory, which is doing research into qualitative reasoning, knowledge representation, and other topics. One interesting outgrowth of the early “office of the future” research is the Co-Lab, an experimental conference room that uses projection screens, the Ethernet, and half a dozen Dorados to help people work together and make decisions about complex projects.
 
	The next decade of advances in computer science may come from PARC—from “my grown-up baby,” as Goldman puts it. Or they may come from somewhere else. But the “architects of information” who made PARC famous have no doubt that they will come.
 
	“There is something about high technology, an excitement about being right out at the absolute edge and shoving as hard as we can because we can see where the digital revolution is going to go,” said Pixar’s Smith. “It has got to happen. I can’t imagine it not being exciting somewhere.”
	 One statement of PARC’s charter was “to build the office of the future,” and at least one group of researchers chose to take this command literally. They built prototypes of future offices that people could work in to evaluate their quality. Two of their most dramatic creations were the Egg—a large, leathery ellipsoid with a computer and a stereo inside—and the Wheel, shown here. The Wheel, designed by Bill Bowman, an industrial designer, incorporated an adjustable Volvo seat, two adjustable monitors, and a sculptured teak desk-top and keyboard. It was mobile; the researchers envisioned that groups of Wheels could be easily rearranged as projects and working groups changed. “One day they rolled this thing out into the pasture behind PARC, with the horses eating grass around it, and had one of the secretaries sit inside and communicate to someone’s wife in Palo Alto while we took pictures,” Alvy Ray Smith recalled. Asked to describe their vision of the charter for the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center and of their role at PARC, the following group of early employees gave diverse responses: “If Xerox was going to be an interesting company in the 80’s and ’90s, it was going to have to move out beyond copiers to a broader context of dealing with information that knowledge-workers used. The office in the ’60s and ’70s used analog technology. It seemed that digital technology could be developed to allow people to work with knowledge.”—Robert Taylor, at PARC during 1970-83 and now director of Digital Equipment Corp.’s Systems Research Center. “Xerox offered 10 years of blank-check funding. They never promised to make the stuff into products; that wasn’t the charter.”—Alan Kay, 1970-81, now a research fellow at Apple Computer Inc. “PARC had three roles: to be a resource to the rest of the company, consulting and advising and assisting; to be viewed as an absolutely first-class research facility by the rest of the world; and to have some discernible impact on Xerox Corp.’s product line five years hence.”—Richard G. Shoup, 1970-79, now chairman of Aurora Systems. “What office workers are really in the business of doing is not copying pieces of paper; it’s copying information. PARC was going to make other ways of manipulating and handling that information.” —Jim Mitchell, 1971-84, now director of Acorn Computer Co.’s Palo Alto research facility. “Xerox offered 10 years of blank-check funding. They never promised to make the stuff into products; that wasn’t the charter.”—Alan Kay “Alan Kay said we were going to do a 10-year project, and I thought that at the end of 1980 we would have a Dynabook.” —Larry Tesler, 1973-80, now manager of object-oriented systems at Apple Computer Inc. “I was fresh out of graduate school. I knew I would be working with amorphous semiconductors, and that was exciting. —David Thornburg, 1971-81, now cofounder of Koala Technologies Inc. “There seemed to be a sort of open agenda as to what we did. Each of us had his own vision of what was possible.” —Dan Ingalls, 1971-84, now a principal engineer at Apple Computer Inc. “The only particular thing I remember is I figured that if Alan Kay works there, I bet I don’t have to wear a tie. I was right.”—Doug Fairbairn, 1972-80, now vice president for user-designed technology at VLSI Technologies Inc. “I wanted to make sure I wasn’t going to be put to work making copiers; they argued that the issues of software development and productivity were going to be Important to them.”—Warren Teitelman, 1972-84, now manager of programming environments at Sun Microsystems. “We would be doing good computer science in an environment in which it would eventually find its way into office products.”—Chuck Geschke, 1972-82, now executive vice president at Adobe Systems Inc. “I came to work on some special-purpose system architecture, to explore how to create custom digital hardware-software systems.”—Lynn Conway, 1973-83, now professor of electrical engineering and computer science and associate dean of engineering at the University of Michigan, after a recent stint as a manager of computer research at DARPA. “Xerox PARC had this aura of being a very far-out place. It was corporate, but it was very unusual for anything corporate to have the apparent foresight to bring some of the best people in the world together and let them do anything they wanted.” —Alvy Ray Smith, 1973-74, now director of graphics research in Lucasfilm Ltd.’s computer graphics department; soon to be vice president and chief technical officer of Pixar Inc., a spin-off of Lucasfilm. “I really didn’t have a good understanding—I don’t think anybody had. It was more a question of who we would be working with.”—Charles Simonyi, 1974-81, now manager of application development at Microsoft Corp. “It isn’t PARC’s job to develop products. PARC’s job is to develop the ideas on which we can produce a product scenario.”—John Ellenby, 1974-80, now president of Grid Systems Corp. “The charter was to explore various forms of office systems, to try things out, to develop software and systems that would be useful in offices. It made perfectly good sense to me.”—Severo Ornstein, 1974-83, now national chairman of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility. “I was hired to manage the Systems Science Lab, basically centered around using computers. Alan [Kay) was probably one of the drawing attractions.”—Bert Sutherland, 1975-81, now a founder of Sutherland, Sproull & Associates, Inc. “Very few people were hired with a specific project in mind. If you’re a researcher, it’s up to you to be a self-motivator.”—John Warnock, 1978-82, now president of Adobe Systems Inc. Almost everything developed at Xerox PARC had a special name. The Alto, of course, was named for Palo Alto, but the computers that succeeded it were a strange collection beginning with “D”—Dolphin, Dorado, Dandelion, Dragon, and Dandetiger (an upgrade of the Dandelion). The unofficial name of the recently announced Xerox 1185 workstation, Xerox’s new artificial-intelligence programming machine, was the Daisy. All of these personal computers—with their distinctive large bit-mapped screens, three-button mice, and keyboards with several unlabeled keys—are referred to as D-machines. The version of Interlisp, an artificial-intelligence language, that runs on the D-machines is known as Interlisp-D, to distinguish it from Interlisp-10, which runs on PDP-10 mainframes. EARS—the name of the first laser printer—stood for Ethernet-Alto-Research character generator-Scanning laser output terminal. Dover, Pimlico, Puffin, and Penguin are the names of its early successors: Dover was the first “production” laser printer, of which several dozen were made with depreciated Xerox 7000s bought from the copier division; Pimlico and Puffin were the first two color laser printers; and Penguin was a high-resolution black-and-white printer that replaced the Dover. The distributed-computing image at PARC, in which a network was viewed as a collection of independent agents and servers acting in concert, also led to imaginative names for individual machines. In 1983, the Knowledge Systems Area in PARC, for example, had Dolphins named Galileo, Darwin, Da Vinci, and Archimedes; Dorados named Ahwahnee, Plaza, and Waldorf; and an Alto, acting as a file server, named Ivy. The names were not merely clever but were also functional; for example, a user could “chat” with Ivy to learn statistics on disk space, the status of a particular file, or other information.  “If you wanted something to last forever, you called it interim.”—Jim Mitchell In software probably the simplest progression is Smalltalk-71, Smalltalk-72, Smalltalk-76 (completed in 1977), Smalltalk-78 (completed in 1979), and Smalltalk-80(completed in 1982). In the Computer Science Laboratory, SPL (systems programming language) from the Berkeley Computer Corp. begat MPL (modular programming language), which begat Mesa, which begat Mesa-Cedar, a complete programming environment for Mesa running on D-machines. (Mesa-Cedar was later renamed Cedar to avoid confusion.) Giving software botanical names like Cedar (after items in the Sunset Garden Book) was a popular practice; Laurel was one of the first electronic-mail programs at PARC, and Juniper was an early (though unsuccessful) distributed file system. The file system in use today with some PARC hardware is IFS—the interim file system. “It got to be a joke,” said Jim Mitchell, now vice president of research at the Acorn Research Center in Palo Alto, Calif. “If you wanted something to last forever, you called it interim.”  Employees rolled into PARC at all hours of the day and night. Some, like Alan Kay, did their best work from 4:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. Others tended to work late into the night to take full advantage of the computing resources, but the switch to personal computers instead of shared mainframes changed that. “The Alto didn’t run faster at night,” Warren Teitelman recalled. For some, work styles cycled. “You got up when you were rested, came in when you were ready, and worked until whenever,” Teitelman said. Bicycles were a common means of transportation. Recalled Richard Shoup: “I would ride up to the lab and down the sidewalk and right in through the front door. Still on my bike, I would ride down the hall, park outside my office, work for the day, then get on the bicycle and ride down the hall and out the front door.” Even getting a group together for lunch meant a bike trip. “One of the deals, “said Kay, “was that if you wanted to drink beer at lunch you had to bike there and back to keep from gaining weight.” Entering PARC today is much like entering any large corporation or research center: a desk where visitors sign in, identification badges for employees, and a requirement that visitors be escorted at all times. Cameras are forbidden. PARC has had a fluctuating reputation for openness. On the one hand, relatively few articles were published by its researchers in its first five years; on the other hand, the Apple Lisa was conceived in 1979 when Steve Jobs, Apple’s chairman, toured PARC and saw his first bit-mapped display. In the earliest days, recalled David Thornburg—a former PARC researcher who is now chief scientist of Koala Technologies Corp., Santa Clara, Calif.—PARC carried the open-door policy to extremes. Jack Goldman, Xerox’s vice president for research, had in fact decided to build the research center within bicycling distance of Stanford University to ensure cross-fertilization with the academic world. “People were coming in and out all the time from the artificial-intelligence lab at Stanford and from other places,” Thornburg said. “There wasn’t as much of a concern for security-we saw ourselves as a university environment where we didn’t have to teach courses.” Thornburg recalled one incident that exemplifies that open attitude. In the late spring of 1971, Goldman held a staff meeting at PARC during which he stressed the need for a way of communicating the center’s research results to Xerox at large. Thornburg remembered that Goldman told the staff, “We need to have some kind of reporting-six-monthly reports or monthly reports—so the rest of the company has a way of finding out what’s going on.” “So this one fellow,” Thornburg related, “who was sitting back in his chair raised his hand and said, ‘Well, if you ask me, Jack, what I think we should do is build a computer-based query system where we write our reports and tag the different levels of the report in terms of their depth, so somebody who just wants a summary review will get a condensed document, and someone who wants an in-depth review will get the whole document.’ ” While Goldman praised this innovative suggestion, Thornburg said, PARC researcher Bob Bauer, who was sitting next to Thornburg, suppressed laughter. The meeting broke up, and Bauer “shot out of the room into the hallway and was just laughing hysterically,” Thornburg said, continuing: “I went over to him and asked, ‘Bob, what’s so funny?’ And he said, ‘You know that guy who just gave the suggestion to Goldman?’ ” “ ‘Yes?’ ” “ ‘He doesn’t work here,’ Bauer said. ‘He’s from the Stanford Al lab, and he was over here talking with some people, and they said, Gee, we’ve got to go to a staff meeting, do you want to come along?’ ” “I don’t think Goldman ever knew that guy didn’t work for Xerox,” Thornburg said. The word went out quietly through PARC that openness had its limits, but it wasn’t yet clear where those limits were. A much more explosive incident, in terms of PARC’s reputation and its relations with the parent company, came with a 1973 article in Rolling Stone magazine that was written by Stewart Brand. Brand, creator of The Whole Earth Catalog, a bible for the 1960s, had visited PARC, as well as several other research centers, to see what its visionaries were doing. He found Alan Kay, working on the Dynabook for “us kids”; Peter Deutsch, who wrote one of the first Lisp interpreters at age 15 and had “served on every major front in computer science” while working for ARPA; and Bob Taylor, the “chief marble collector” from ARPA, who put the group together. Taylor, according to Brand, was directing his researchers on the premise that the benefits of large, centralized computers “are less than claimed.” “And that is the general bent of research at [PARC]—soft, away from hugeness and centrality, toward the small and the personal, toward putting maximum computing power in the hands of every individual who wants it,” Brand wrote. “When the article, ‘Fanatic life and symbolic death among the computer bums,’ was published [in Rolling Stone], it really upset Xerox,” recalled Alvy Ray Smith, now vice president and chief technical officer of Pixar Inc., San Rafael, Calif. “All these wild, hairy people out there in a research lab got written up—how embarrassing! I’ve recently learned that when you go out and try to raise giant money in the financial world, you don’t come across as a long hair. Xerox could not afford to have people think they were flakes.” “Jack Goldman, and I forget who else, came out to PARC right after the article was published,” Thornburg recalled. “We were all on the edges of our seats thinking the lab was going to be closed down.” “It was made crystal-clear to use that this was not all right. If it happened again, the lab was going to be shut down. That was a very sobering experience. That was about the time we began having badges and all that sort of stuff—which after all is what companies do.” When David Em, the artist, first visited PARC in 1975, such trappings of corporate security were the norm. “It was a strange environment for an artist,” he recalled. “There was a guard gate, you needed a pass, there were all sorts of access codes on the terminals.” Even today, though, PARC is not nearly as watchful as many corporate research facilities. Many students and faculty members from Stanford are consultants at PARC, carrying ideas freely back and forth, and visitors still occasionally wander the halls by themselves. And some of the regular employees—having trouble figuring out whether to clip their badges to the collars of their T-shirts or to the belt loops of their shorts—just keep them in a handy pocket.

 In 1997, Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen created a sensation among venture capitalists and entrepreneurs with his book The Innovator's Dilemma. The lesson that most people remember from it is that a well-run business can’t afford to switch to a new approach—one that ultimately will replace its current business model—until it is too late. One of the most famous examples of this conundrum involved photography. The large, very profitable companies that made film for cameras knew in the mid-1990s that digital photography would be the future, but there was never really a good time for them to make the switch. At almost any point they would have lost money. So what happened, of course, was that they were displaced by new companies making digital cameras. (Yes, Fujifilm did survive, but the transition was not pretty, and it involved an improbable series of events, machinations, and radical changes.)            ","And how Xerox lost it An undated exterior view of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) is shown in Palo Alto, California. In late 1969, C. Peter McColough, chairman of Xerox Corp., told the New York Society of Security Analysts that Xerox was determined to develop “the architecture of information” to solve the problems that had been created by the “knowledge explosion.” Legend has it that McColough then turned to Jack E. Goldman, senior vice president of research and development, and said, “All right, go start a lab that will find out what I just meant.” This article was first published as “Inside the PARC: the ‘information architects’.” It appeared in the October 1985 issue of IEEE Spectrum. A PDF version is available on IEEE Xplore. The diagrams and photographs appeared in the original print version. Goldman tells it differently. In 1969 Xerox had just bought Scientific Data Systems (SDS), a mainframe computer manufacturer. “When Xerox bought SDS,” he recalled, “I walked promptly into the office of Peter McColough and said, ‘Look, now that we’re in this digital computer business, we better damned well have a research laboratory!’ ” In any case, the result was the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in California, one of the most unusual corporate research organizations of our time. PARC is one of three research centers within Xerox; the other two are in Webster, N.Y., and Toronto, Ont., Canada. It employs approximately 350 researchers, managers, and support staff (by comparison, Bell Laboratories before the AT&T breakup employed roughly 25,000). PARC, now in its 15th year, originated or nurtured technologies that led to these developments, among others: In the mid-1970s, close to half of the top 100 computer scientists in the world were working at PARC, and the laboratory boasted similar strength in other fields, including solid-state physics and optics. Some researchers say PARC was a product of the 1960s and that decade’s philosophy of power to the people, of improving the quality of life. When the center opened in 1970, it was unlike other major industrial research laboratories; its work wasn’t tied, even loosely, to its corporate parent’s current product lines. And unlike university research laboratories, PARC had one unifying vision: it would develop “the architecture of information.” IEEE Spectrum Research projects at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, represented on this family tree by heart-encircled carvings surrounded by the initials of some of their key developers, had their roots in many places, including projects funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (the ARPAnet), the University of Utah (Flex), and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Sketchpad). The ideas developed at PARC found their way into a number of commercial products, companies, and publications, shown here as leafy branches. Some of these real-world offspring, like the Apple Lisa computer and the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer, took many of their root concepts from PARC; others, like the Ada computer language and the Intel 1103 dynamic RAM chip, are less closely related. As for the future impact of PARC research—the sky’s the limit. The originator of that phrase is unclear. McColough has credited his speechwriter. The speechwriter later said that neither he nor McColough had a specific definition of the phrase. So almost everyone who joined PARC in its formative years had a different idea of what the center’s charter was. This had its advantages. Since projects were not assigned from above, the researchers formed their own groups; support for a project depended on how many people its instigator could get to work on it. “The phrase was ‘Tom Sawyering,’ ” recalled James G. Mitchell, who joined PARC from the defunct Berkeley Computer Corp. in 1971 and is now vice president of research at the Acorn Research Centre in Palo Alto. “Someone would decide that a certain thing was really important to do. They would start working on it, give some structure to it, and then try to convince other people to come whitewash this fence with them.” When Goldman set up PARC, one of his first decisions was to ask George E. Pake, a longtime friend, to run it. Pake was executive vice chancellor, provost, and professor of physics at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo. One of the first decisions Pake in turn made was to hire, among others, Robert Taylor, then at the University of Utah, to help him recruit engineers and scientists for the Computer Science and Systems Science Laboratories. Taylor had been director of the information-processing techniques office at ARPA (the U.S. military’s Advanced Research Projects Agency), where he and others had funded the heyday of computer research in the mid- and late 1960s. PARC started with a small nucleus—perhaps fewer than 20 people. Nine came from the Berkeley Computer Corp., a small mainframe computer company that Taylor had tried to convince Xerox to buy as a way of starting up PARC. (Many of the people at BCC were responsible for the design of the SDS 940, the computer on the strength of which Xerox bought Scientific Data Systems in 1968.) The 20 PARC employees were housed in a small, rented building, “with rented chairs, rented desks, a telephone with four buttons on it, and no receptionist,” recalled David Thornburg, who joined PARC’s General Science Laboratory fresh out of graduate school in 1971. The group thought it should have a computer of its own. “It’s a little hard to do language research and compiler research without having a machine,” said Mitchell. The computer they wanted was a PDP-10 from Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC). “There was a rivalry in Datamation [magazine] advertisements between Xerox’s SDS and DEC,” recalled Alan Kay, who came to PARC as a researcher from Stanford University’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in late 1970. “When we wanted a PDP-10, Xerox envisioned a photographer lining up a shot of DEC boxes going into the PARC labs, so they said, ‘How about a Sigma 7?’ “We decided it would take three years to do a good operating system for a Sigma 7, while we could build an entire PDP-10 in just one year.” The result was MAXC (Multiple Access Xerox Computer), which emulated the PDP-10 but used semiconductor dynamic RAMs instead of core. So much care was lavished on MAXC’s hardware and software that it held the all-time record for continuous availability as a node on the ARPAnet. MAXC was crucial to a number of developments. The Intel Corp., which had made the 1,103 dynamic memory chips used in the MAXC design, reaped one of the first benefits. “Most of the 1,103 memory chips you bought from Intel at the time didn’t work,” recalled Kay. So PARC researcher Chuck Thacker built a chip-tester to screen chips for MAXC. A later version of that tester, based on an Alto personal computer, also developed at PARC, ended up being used by Intel itself on its production line. And MAXC gave PARC experience in building computers that would later stand the center in good stead. “There were three capabilities we needed that we could not get if we bought a PDP-10,” recalled an early PARC lab manager. “We needed to develop a vendor community—local people who would do design layouts, printed-circuit boards, and so forth—and the only way to get that is to drive it with a project. We also needed semiconductor memory, which PDP-10s did not have. And we thought we needed to learn more about microprogrammable machines, although it turned out we didn’t use those features.” Bit map A method for creating computer displays by assigning an individual memory location to each point on the screen. Distributed computing A technique whereby many computers are linked in a network and cooperate in performing tasks; individual computers and their users may send messages to each other, transfer information, and initiate actions at remote machines. Electronic mail An extension to computer file systems that allows users to send messages to each other and to be signaled when a message is received, but to read messages only at their convenience. Frame buffer A memory capable of storing all the information for a single video frame; the contents of a frame buffer can be controlled by special software to produce or modify images. Local area network A high-speed network that connects computers, printers, and other peripherals in an office or building. Object-oriented programming A programming technique in which individual objects exchange messages to carry out tasks; this contrasts with more typical programming styles, in which programs carry out transformations on passive data structures. MAXC set a pattern for PARC: building its own hardware. That committed its researchers to visions that must be turned into reality—at least on a small scale. “One of the blood oaths that was taken by the original founders was that we would never do a system that wasn’t engineered for 100 users,” said Kay. “That meant that if it was a time-sharing system, you had to run 100 people on it; if it was a programming language, 100 people had to program in it without having their hands constantly held. If it was a personal computer, you had to be able to build 100.” This policy of building working systems is not the only way of doing research; Mitchell recalled that it was a bone of contention at PARC. “Systems research requires building systems,” he said. “Otherwise you don’t know whether the ideas you have are any good, or how difficult they are to implement. But there are people who think that when you are building things you are not doing research.” Since MAXC, the center has built prototypes of dozens of hardware and software systems—prototypes that sometimes numbered in the thousands of units. Alan Kay, whose “Smalltalk” group created overlapping windows, is perhaps PARC’s most famous alumnus. After spending 10 years at PARC, he became chief scientist at Atari Inc. and is now a fellow at Apple Computer Inc. The first personal computer developed in the United States is commonly thought to be the MITS Altair, which sold as a hobbyist’s kit in 1976. At nearly the same time the Apple I became available, also in kit form. But by the end of that year there were also 200 Alto personal computers in daily use—the first of them having been built in 1973. While researchers in PARC’s Computer Science Laboratory were completing the MAXC and beginning to use it, their counterparts in the Systems Science Laboratory were putting together a distributed­ computer system using Nova 800 processors and a high-speed character generator. In September 1972, researchers Butler Lampson and Chuck Thacker of PARC’s Computer Science Laboratory went to Alan Kay in the Systems Science Laboratory and asked, “Do you have any money?” Kay told them that he had about US $250,000 earmarked for more Nova 800s and character-generation hardware. “How would you like us to build you a computer?” Lampson asked Kay. “I’d like it a lot,” Kay replied. And on Nov. 22, 1972, Thacker and Ed McCreight began building what was to become the Alto. A Xerox executive reportedly angered Thacker by insisting that it would take 18 months to develop a major hardware system. When Thacker argued that he could do it in three months, a bet was placed. It took a little longer than three months, but not much. On April 1, 1973, Thornburg recalled, “I walked into the basement where the prototype Alto was sitting, with its umbilical cord attached to a rack full of Novas, and saw Ed McCreight sitting back in a chair with the little words, ‘Alto lives’ in the upper left corner of the display screen.” Kay said the Alto turned out to be “a vector sum of what Lampson wanted, what Thacker wanted, and what I wanted. Lampson wanted a $500 PDP-10,” he recalled. “Thacker wanted a 10-times-faster Nova 800, and I wanted a machine that you could carry around and children could use.” The reason the Alto could be built so quickly was its simplicity. The processor, recalled Kay, “was hardly more than a clock”—only 160 chips in 1973’s primitive integrated circuit technology. The architecture goes back to the TX-2, built with 32 program counters at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Lincoln Laboratories in the late 1950s. The Alto, which had 16 program counters, would fetch its next instruction from whichever counter had the highest priority at any given moment. Executing multiple tasks incurred no overhead. While the machine was painting the screen display, the dynamic memory was being refreshed every 2 milliseconds, the keyboard was being monitored, and information was being transferred to and from the disk. The task of lowest priority was running the user’s program. In 1973 every researcher at PARC wanted an Alto personal computer, but there weren’t enough to go around. To speed things up, researchers dropped into the Alto laboratory whenever they had a few free moments to help with computer assembly. The prototype was a success, and more Altos were built. Research on user interfaces, computer languages, and graphics began in earnest. Lampson, Thacker, and other instigators of the project got the first models. Many PARC researchers pitched in to speed up the production schedules, but there never seemed to be enough Altos. “There was a lab where the Altos were getting built, with circuit boards lying around, and anyone could go in and work on them,” recalled Daniel H.H. Ingalls, now a principal engineer at Apple Computer Inc., Cupertino, Calif. Ron Rider, who is still with Xerox, “had an Alto when Altos were impossible to get,” recalled Bert Sutherland, who joined PARC in 1975 as manager of the Systems Science Laboratory. “When I asked him how he got one, he told me that he went around to the various laboratories, collected parts that people owed him, and put it together himself.” By today’s standards the Alto was not a particularly powerful computer. But if several Altos are linked, along with file servers and printers, the result looks suspiciously like the office of the future. The idea of a local computer network had been discussed before PARC was founded—in 1966, at Stanford University. Larry Tesler, now manager of object-oriented systems at Apple, who had graduated from Stanford, was still hanging around the campus when the university was considering buying an IBM 360 time-sharing system. “One of the guys and I proposed that instead they buy 100 PDP-1s and link them together in a network,” Tesler said. “Some of the advisors thought that was a great idea; a consultant from Yale, Alan Perlis, told them that was what they ought to do, but the IBM-oriented people at Stanford thought it would be safer to buy the time-sharing system. They missed the opportunity to invent local networking.” So PARC ended up with another first. At the same time that the Alto was being built, Thacker conceived of the Ethernet, a coaxial cable that would link machines in the simplest possible fashion. It was based in part on the Alohanet, a packet radio network developed at the University of Hawaii in the late 1960s. “Thacker made the remark that coaxial cable is nothing but captive ether,” said Kay. “So that part of it was already set before Robert Metcalfe and David Boggs came on board—that it would be packet-switching and that it would be a collision-type network. But then Metcalfe and Boggs sweated for a year to figure out how to do the damn thing.” (Metcalfe later founded 3Com Corp., in Mountain View, Calif.; Boggs is now with DEC Western Research, in Los Altos, Calif. The two of them hold the basic patents on the Ethernet.) “I’ve always thought the fact that [David] Boggs was a ham radio operator was important.... [He] knew that you could communicate reliably through an unreliable medium. I’ve often wondered what would have happened if he hadn’t had that background.”—Bert Sutherland “I’ve always thought the fact that Boggs was a ham radio operator was important,” Sutherland said. “It had a great impact on the way the Ethernet was designed, because the Ethernet fundamentally doesn’t work reliably. It’s like citizens’ band radio, or any of the other kinds of radio communication, which are fundamentally not reliable in the way that we think of the telephone. Because you know it basically doesn’t work, you do all the defensive programming—the ‘say again, you were garbled’ protocols that were worked out for radio communication. And that makes the resulting network function extremely reliably.” “Boggs was a ham and knew that you could communicate reliably through an unreliable medium. I’ve often wondered what would have happened if he hadn’t had that background,” Sutherland added. Once the Ethernet was built, using it was fairly simple: A computer that wanted to send a message would wait and see whether the cable was clear. If it was, the machine would send the information in a packet prefaced with the address of its recipient. If two messages collided, the machines that sent them would each wait for a random interval before trying again. One innovative use for the network had nothing to do with people sending messages to one another; it involved communication solely between machines. Because the dynamic memory chips were so unreliable in those days, the Alto also ran a memory check when it wasn’t doing anything else. Its response to finding a bad chip was remarkable: “It would send a message telling which Alto was bad, which slot had the bad board, and which row and column had the bad chips,” Thornburg said. “The reason I found out about this was that one day the repairman showed up and said, ‘Any time you’re ready to power down, I need to fix your Alto,’ and I didn’t even know anything was wrong.” While the Ethernet was being developed, so was another crucial element in the office of the future: the laser printer. After all, what use was a screen that could show documents in multiple type styles and a network that could transmit them from place to place without some means of printing them efficiently? The idea for the laser printer came to PARC from Xerox’s Webster, N.Y., research laboratory—along with its proponent, Gary Starkweather. He had the idea of using a laser to paint information, in digital form, onto the drum or belt of a copying machine, then-research vice president Goldman recalled. Starkweather reported to the vice president of the Business Products Group for Advanced Development, George White. “George White came to me,” said Goldman, “and said, ‘Look, Jack, I got a terrific guy named Gary Starkweather doing some exciting things on translating visual information to print by a laser, using a Xerox machine, of course. What an ideal concept that would be for Xerox. But I don’t think he’s going to thrive in Rochester; nobody’s going to listen to him, they’re not going to do anything that far advanced. Why don’t you take him out to your new lab in Palo Alto?’ ” Newly appointed PARC manager Pake jumped at the opportunity. Starkweather and a few other researchers from Rochester were transferred to Palo Alto and started PARC’s Optical Science Laboratory. The first laser printer, EARS (Ethernet-Alto-Research character generator-Scanning laser output terminal), built by Starkweather and Ron Rider, began printing documents that were generated by Altos and sent to it via Ethernet in 1973. EARS wasn’t perfect, Thornburg said. It had a dynamic character generator that would create new patterns for characters and graphics as they came in. If a page had no uppercase Qs in it, the character generator would economize on internal memory by not generating a pattern for a capital “Q.” But if a page contained a very complex picture, the character generator would run out of space for patterns; “there were certain levels of complexity in drawings that couldn’t be printed,” Thornburg recalled. Even with these drawbacks, the laser printer was still an enormous advance over the line printers, teletypes, and facsimile printers that were available at the time, and Goldman pushed to have it commercialized as quickly as possible. But Xerox resisted. In fact, a sore point throughout PARC’s history has been the parent organization’s seeming inability to exploit the developments that researchers made. In 1972, when Starkweather built his first prototype, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, in an effort to spur the technology, put out a request for bids for five laser printers. But Goldman was unable to convince the executive to whom Xerox’s Electro-Optical Systems division reported (whose background was accounting and finance) to allow a bid. The reason: Xerox might have lost $150 000 over the life of the contract if the laser printers needed repair as often as the copiers on which they were based, even though initial evidence showed that printing caused far less wear and tear than copying. In 1974 the laser printer first became available outside PARC when a small group of PARC researchers under John Ellenby—who built the Alto II, a production-line version of the Alto, and who is now vice president of development at Grid Systems Corp., Mountain View, Calif.—began buying used copiers from Xerox’s copier division and installing laser heads in them. The resulting printers, known as Dovers, were distributed within Xerox and to universities. Sutherland estimated that several dozen were built. “They stripped out all the optics and turned them back to the copier division for credit,” he recalled. Even today, he said, he receives laser-printed documents from universities in which he can recognize the Dover typefaces. Also in 1974, the Product Review Committee at Xerox head­quarters in Rochester, N.Y., was finally coming to a decision about what kind of computer printer the company should manufacture. “A bunch of horse’s asses who don’t know anything about technology were making the decision, and it looked to me, sitting a week before the election, that it was going toward CRT technology,” said Goldman. (Another group at Xerox had developed a printing system whereby text displayed on a special cathode ray tube would be focused on a copier drum and printed.) “It was Monday night. I commandeered a plane,” Goldman recalled. “I took the planning vice president and the marketing vice president by the ear, and I said, ‘You two guys are coming with me. Clear your Tuesday calendars. You are coming with me to PARC tonight. We’ll be back for the 8:30 meeting on Wednesday morning.’ We left around 7:00 p.m., got to California at 1:00, which is only 10:00 their time, and the guys at PARC, bless their souls, did a beautiful presentation showing what the laser printer could do.” “If you’re dealing with marketing or planning people, make them kick the tires. All the charts and all the slides aren’t worth a damn,” Goldman said. From a purely economic standpoint, Xerox’s investment in PARC for its first decade was returned with interest by the profits from the laser printer. The committee opted to go with laser technology, but there were delays. “They wouldn’t let us get them out on 7000s,” Goldman said, referring to the old-model printer that Ellenby’s group had used as a base. “Instead they insisted on going with new 9000 Series, which didn’t come out until 1977.” From a purely economic standpoint, Xerox’s investment in PARC for its first decade was returned with interest by the profits from the laser printer. This is perhaps ironic, since one vision of the office of the future was that it would be paperless. “I think PARC has generated more paper than any other office by far, because at the press of a button you can print 30 copies of any report,” observed Douglas Fairbairn, a former PARC technician and now vice president for user-designed technology at VLSI Technology Inc. “If the report is 30 pages long, that’s 1000 pages, but it still takes only a few minutes. Then you say, ‘I guess I wanted that picture on the other page.’ That’s another 1000 pages.” By the mid-1970s the Altos in the offices of most PARC re­searchers had been customized to their tastes. Richard Shoup’s Alto had a color display. Taylor’s Alto had a speaker—which played “The Eyes of Texas Are Upon You” whenever he received an electronic mail message. And, as many people have found in the 10 years since the Alto became widespread at PARC, personal computers can be used for enjoyment as well as work. The PARC researchers were among the first to discover this. “At night, whenever I was in Palo Alto,” Goldman said, “I’d go over to the laboratory and watch Alan Kay invent a game. This was long before electronic games, and these kids were inventing these things all the time until midnight, 1:00 a.m.” “Xerox had the first electronic raffle nationwide. At Xerox, I received my first electronic junk mailing, first electronic job acceptance, and first electronic obituary.”—Bert Sutherland “l enjoyed observing a number of firsts,” Sutherland said. “Xerox had the first electronic raffle nationwide. At Xerox, I received my first electronic junk mailing, first electronic job acceptance, and first electronic obituary.” When the Xerox 914 copiers came out in the early 1960s, “I was a copy freak,” said Lynn Conway who joined PARC from Memorex Corp. in 1973 and is now associate dean and professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “I liked to make things and give them out, like maps—all kinds of things. And in the Xerox environment in ’76, all of a sudden you could create things and make lots of them.” Dozens of clubs and interest groups were started that met on the network. Whatever a PARC employee’s hobby or interest, he or she could find someone with whom to share that interest electronically. Much serious work got done electronically as well: reports, articles, sometimes entire design projects were done through the network. One side effect of all this electronic communication was a disregard for appearances and other external trappings of status. “People at PARC have a tendency to have very strong personalities, and sometimes in design sessions those personalities came over a little more strongly than the technical content,” said John Warnock, who joined PARC in 1978 from the Evans & Sutherland Corp., where he worked on high-speed graphics systems. Working via electronic mail eliminated the personality problems during design sessions. Electronic interaction was particularly useful for soft­ware researchers, who could send code back and forth. Warnock, who is now president of Adobe Systems Inc., Palo Alto, Calif., described the design of lnterpress, a printing protocol: “One of the designers was in Pittsburgh, one of them was in Philadelphia, there were three of us in this area, and a couple in El Segundo [Calif.]. The design was done almost completely over the mail system, remotely; there were only two occasions when we all got together in the same room.” Electronic mail was also invaluable for keeping track of group projects. “One of the abilities that is really useful is to save a sequence of messages on a particular subject so that you can refer to it,” said Warren Teitelman, who joined PARC in 1972 from BBN Inc. and is currently manager of programming environments at Sun Microsystems in Mountain View. “Or if somebody comes into a discussion late and they don’t have the context, you can bring them up to date by sending them all the messages,” Teitelman added. But electronic mail sometimes got out of hand at PARC. Once, after Teitelman had been out of touch for a week, he logged onto the system and found 600 messages in his mailbox. Antialiasing—removing jagged edges from diagonal lines and curves—is a standard technique in computer graphics today. These pictures, produced by Superpaint at PARC in 1972, were among the first demonstrations of antialiasing. As anyone who has sat through a business meeting knows, the office of today includes graphics as well as text. In 1970, Shoup, who is now chairman of Aurora Systems Inc., started working at PARC on new ways to create and manipulate images digitally in the office of the future. His research started the field of television graphics and won Emmy awards for both him and Xerox. “It quickly became clear that if we wanted to do a raster scan system, we ought to do it compatible with television standards so that we could easily obtain monitors and cameras and videotape recorders,” Shoup recalled. In early 1972 he built some simple hardware to generate antialiased lines, and by early 1973 the system, called Superpaint, was completed. It was the first complete paint system with an 8-bit frame buffer anywhere, recalled Alvy Ray Smith, who worked with Superpaint at PARC and is soon to be vice president and chief technical officer of Pixar Inc., San Rafael, Calif.; it was also the first system to use several graphics aids: color lookup tables for simple animation, a digitizing tablet for input, a palette for mixing colors directly on the screen. The system also had a real-time video scanner so images of real objects could be digitized and then manipulated. “The very first thing I did on the system was some antialiased lines and circles,” Shoup said, “because I’d written a paper on that subject and hadn’t finished the examples. But when I submitted the paper and had it accepted, the machine that was going to be used to do the examples wasn’t built yet.” By mid-1974, Superpaint had been augmented by additional software that allowed it to perform all kinds of tricks, and Smith, who had just completed doctoral work in a branch of mathematics known as cellular automata theory, was hired to help put the machine through its paces. He used Superpaint to make a videotape called “Vidbits” that was later shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Six months later his initial contract with PARC expired and was not renewed. While disappointed, Smith was not surprised, as he had found that not everyone there shared his enthusiasm for painting with a computer. “The color graphics lab was a long narrow room with seven doors into it,” he recalled. “You had to go through it to get to a lot of other places. Most people, when they walked through, would look at the screen and stop—even the most trite stuff had never been seen before. Cycling color maps had never been seen before. But there were some people who would go through and wouldn’t stop. I couldn’t figure out how people could walk through that room and never stop and look.” A reason aside from others’ indifference to video graphics may have contributed to Smith’s departure. One of the first times Superpaint was seen by a wide audience was in a public television show, “Supervisions,” produced by station KCET in Los Angeles. “It was just used a couple of times for little color cycling effects,” Shoup recalled. But Xerox was not amused by the unauthorized use of the system in a program. “Bob Taylor sat with Alvy [Smith] one entire afternoon while Alvy pushed the erase button on the videotape recorder, eliminating the Xerox logo from every copy of that tape,” Shoup continued. (This was one of the tapes viewed by the committee that awarded Xerox its Emmy.) It was the first system to use...color lookup tables for simple animation, a digitizing tablet for input, [and] a palette for mixing colors directly on the screen. Shoup stayed at PARC, supported by Kay’s research group, while Smith moved on, armed with a National Education Association grant to do computer art. He found support for his work at the New York Institute of Technology, where he helped develop Paint, which became the basis of Ampex Video Art (AVA), and N.Y. Tech’s Images, two graphics systems still in use today. While Shoup was alone in pursuing Superpaint at PARC, Smith wasn’t the only Superpaint addict wandering the country in search of a frame buffer. David Miller, now known as David Em, and David Difrancesco were the first artists to paint with pixels. When Em lost access to Superpaint, he set out on a year-long quest for a frame buffer that finally brought him to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Finally, in 1979, Shoup left PARC to start his own company to manufacture and market a paint system, the Aurora 100. He ac­knowledges that he made no technological leaps in designing the Aurora, which is simply a commercialized second-generation version of his first-generation system at PARC. “The machine we’re building at Aurora for our next generation is directly related to things we were thinking about seven or eight years ago at PARC,” Shoup said. The Aurora 100 is now used by corporations to develop in­ house training films and presentation graphics. Today, tens of thousands of artists are painting with pixels. The 1985 Siggraph art show in San Francisco alone received 4000 entries. Most people who know that a mouse is a computer peripheral think it was invented by Apple. The cognoscenti will correct them by saying that it was developed at Xerox PARC. But the mouse in fact preceded PARC. “I saw a demonstration of a mouse being used as a pointing device in 1966,” Tesler recalled. “Doug Engelbart [of SRI International Inc. in Menlo Park, Calif.] invented it.” At PARC, Tesler set out to prove that the mouse was a bad idea. “I really didn’t believe in it,” he said. “I thought cursor keys were much better. “We literally took people off the streets who had never seen a computer. In three or four minutes they were happily editing away, using the cursor keys. At that point I was going to show them the mouse and prove they could select text faster than with the cursor keys. Then I was going to show that they didn’t like it. “It backfired. I would have them spend an hour working with the cursor keys, which got them really used to the keys. Then I would teach them about the mouse. They would say, ‘That’s interesting but I don’t think I need it.’ Then they would play with it a bit, and after two minutes they never touched the cursor keys again.” “While I didn’t mind using a mouse for text manipulation, I thought it was totally inappropriate for drawing. People stopped drawing with rocks in Paleolithic times.”—David Thornburg After Tesler’s experiment, most PARC researchers accepted the mouse as a proper peripheral for the Alto. One holdout was Thornburg. “I didn’t like the mouse,” he said. “It was the least reliable component of the Alto. I remember going into the repair room at PARC-where there was a shoebox to hold good mice and a 5O-gallon drum for bad mice. And it was expensive—too expensive for the mass market. “While I didn’t mind using a mouse for text manipulation, I thought it was totally inappropriate for drawing. People stopped drawing with rocks in Paleolithic times, and there’s a reason for that: rocks aren’t appropriate drawing implements; people moved on to sticks.” Thornburg, a metallurgist who had been doing materials re­search at PARC, began work on alternative pointing devices. He came up with a touch tablet in 1977 and attached it to an Alto. Most people who looked at it said, “That’s nice, but it’s not a mouse,” Thornburg recalls. His touch tablet did eventually find its way into a product: the Koalapad, a home-computer peripheral costing less than $100. “It was clear that Xerox didn’t want to do anything with it,” Thornburg said. “They didn’t even file for patent protection, so I told them that I’d like to have it. After a lot of horsing around, they said OK.” Thornburg left Xerox in 1981, worked at Atari for a while, then started a company—now Koala Technologies Inc.—with another ex-PARC employee to manufacture and market the Koalapad. Meanwhile, though Tesler accepted the need for a mouse as a pointing device, he wasn’t satisfied with the way SRI’s mouse worked. “You had a five-key keyset for your left hand and a mouse with three buttons for your right hand. You would hit one or two keys with the left hand, then point at something with the mouse with the right hand, and then you had more buttons on the mouse for confirming your commands. It took six to eight keystrokes to do a command, but you could have both hands going at once. Experts could go very fast.” The SRI system was heavily moded. In a system with modes, the user first indicates what he wants to do—delete, for example. This puts the system in the delete mode. The computer then waits for the user to indicate what he wants deleted. If the user changes his mind and tries to do something else, he can’t unless he first cancels the delete command. In a modeless system, the user first points to the part of the dis­play he wants to change, then indicates what should be done to it. He can point at things all day, constantly changing his mind, and never have to follow up with a command. To make things even more complicated for the average user (but more efficient for programmers), the meaning of each key varied, depending on the mode the system was in. For example, “J” meant scroll and “I” meant insert. If the user tried to “insert,” then to “scroll” without canceling the first command, he would end up inserting the letter “J” in the text. Larry Tesler set out to test the interface on a nonprogrammer.... Apparently nobody had done that before. Most programmers at PARC liked the SRI system and began adapting it in their projects. “There was a lot of religion around that this was the perfect user interface,” said Tesler. “Anytime anybody would suggest changing it, they were greeted with glares.” Being programmers, they had no trouble with the fact that the keypad responded to combinations of keys pressed simultaneously that represented the alphabet in binary notation. Tesler set out to test the interface on a nonprogrammer. He taught a newly hired secretary how to work the machine and observed her learning process. “Apparently nobody had done that before,” he said. “She had a lot of trouble with the mouse and the keyset.” Tesler argued for a simpler user interface. “Just about the only person who agreed with me was Alan Kay,” he said. Kay supported Tesler’s attempt to write a modeless text editor on the Alto. Although most popular computers today use modeless soft­ware, with the Macintosh being probably the best example, Tesler’s experiments didn’t settle the issue. “MacWrite, Microsoft Word, and the Xerox Star all started out as projects that were heavily moded,” Tesler said, “because programmers couldn’t believe that a user interface could be flexible and useful and extensible unless it had a lot of modes. The proof that this wasn’t so didn’t come by persuasion, it came through customers complaining that they liked a dinky modeless editor with no features better than the one that had all the features they couldn’t figure out how to use.” The same kinds of simplification that made for the modeless editor were also applied to programming languages and environments at PARC. Seeking a language that children could use, Kay could regularly be seen testing his work with kindergarten and elementary-school pupils. What Kay aimed for was the Dynabook: a simple, portable personal computer that would cater to a person’s information needs and provide an outlet for creativity-writing, drawing, and music composition. Smalltalk was to be the language of the Dynabook. It was based on the concepts of classes pioneered in the programming language Simula, and on the idea of interacting objects communicating by means of messages requesting actions, rather than by programs performing operations directly on data. The first version of Smalltalk was written as the result of a chance conversation between Kay, Ingalls, and Ted Kaehler, another PARC researcher. Ingalls and Kaehler were thinking about writing a language, and Kay said, “You can do one on just one page.” What Kay aimed for was the Dynabook: a simple, portable personal computer. He explained, “If you look at a Lisp interpreter written in itself, the kernel of these things is incredibly small. Smalltalk could be even smaller than Lisp.” The problem with this approach, Kay recalled, is that “Smalltalk is doubly recursive: you’re in the function before you ever do anything with the arguments.” In Smalltalk-72, the first version of the language, control was passed to the object as soon as possible. Thus writing a concise definition of Smalltalk-in Small­ talk-was very difficult. “It took about two weeks to write 10 lines of code,” Kay said, “and it was very hard to see whether those 10 lines of code would work.” Kay spent the two weeks thinking from 4:00 to 8:00 a.m. each day and then discussing his ideas with Ingalls. When Kay was done, Ingalls coded the first Smalltalk in Basic on the Nova 800, because that was the only language available at the time with decent debugging facilities. “Smalltalk was of a scale that you could go out and have a pitcher of beer or two and come back, and then two people would egg each other on and do an entire system in an afternoon.”—Alan Kay Because the language was so small and simple, developing programs and even entire systems was also quite fast. “Smalltalk was of a scale that you could go out and have a pitcher of beer or two and come back, and then two people would egg each other on and do an entire system in an afternoon,” Kay said. From one of those afternoon sessions came overlapping windows. The concept of windows had originated in Sketchpad, an interactive graphics program developed by Ivan Sutherland at MIT in the early 1960s; the Evans & Sutherland Corp. had implemented multiple windows on a graphics machine in the mid-1960s. But the first multiple overlapping windows were implemented on the Alto by PARC’s Diana Merry in 1973. “All of us thought that the Alto display was incredibly small,” said Kay, “and it’s clear that you’ve got to have overlapping windows if you don’t have a large display.” After windows came the concept of Bitblt—block transfers of data from one portion of memory to another, with no restrictions about alignment on word boundaries. Thacker, the main designer of the Alto computer, had implemented a function called CharacterOp to write characters to the Alto’s bit-mapped screen, and Ingalls extended that work to make a general graphic utility. Bitblt made overlapping windows much simpler, and it also made possible all kinds of graphics and animation tricks. “I gave a demo in early 1975 to all of PARC of the Smalltalk system using Bitblt for menus and overlapping windows and things,” Ingalls recalled. “A bunch of people came to me after­wards, saying ‘How do you do all these things? Can I get the code for Bitblt?’ and within two months those things were being used throughout PARC.” Flashy and impressive as it was, Smalltalk-72 “was a dead end,” Tesler said. “It was ambiguous. You could read a piece of code and not be able to tell which were the nouns and which were the verbs. You couldn’t make it fast, and it couldn’t be compiled.” The first compiled version of Smalltalk, written in 1976, marked the end of the emphasis on a language that children could use. The language was now “a mature programming environment,” Ingalls said. “We got interested in exporting it and making it widely available.” “It’s terrible that Smalltalk-80 can’t be used by children, since that’s who Smalltalk was intended for. It fell back into data-structure-type programming instead of simulation-type programming.”—Alan Kay The next major revision of Smalltalk was Smalltalk-80. Kay was no longer on the scene to argue that any language should be simple enough for a child to use. Smalltalk-80, says Tesler, went too far in the opposite direction from the earliest versions of Smalltalk: “It went to such an extreme to make it compilable, uniform, and readable, that it actually became hard to read, and you definitely wouldn’t want to teach it to children.” Kay, looking at Smalltalk-80, said, “It’s terrible that it can’t be used by children, since that’s who Smalltalk was intended for. It fell back into data-structure-type programming instead of simulation-type programming.” While Kay’s group was developing a language for children of all ages, a group of artificial-intelligence researchers within PARC were improving Lisp. Lisp was brought to PARC by Warren Teitelman and Daniel G. Bobrow from Bolt, Beranek, and Newman in Cambridge, Mass., where it was being developed as a service to the ARPA community. At PARC, it was renamed Interlisp, a window system called VLISP was added, and a powerful set of programmers’ tools was developed. In PARC’s Computer Science Laboratory, researchers were developing a powerful language for systems programming. After going through several iterations, the language emerged as Mesa—a modular language, which allowed several programmers to work on a large project at the same time. The key to this is the concept of an interface—what a module in a program does, rather than how it does it. Each programmer knows what the other modules are chartered to do and can call on them to perform their particular functions. Another dominant feature was Mesa’s strong type-checking, which prevented programmers from using integer variables where they needed real numbers, or real numbers where they needed character strings—and prevented bugs from spreading from one module of a program to another. These concepts have since been widely adopted as the basis of modular programming languages. “A lot of the ideas in Ada [the standard programming language of the U.S. Department of Defense] and Modula-2 came out of the programming language research done at PARC,” said Chuck Geschke, now executive vice president of Adobe Systems Inc. Modula-2, in fact, was written by computer scientist Niklaus Wirth after he spent a sabbatical at PARC. While PARC may have had more than its share of successes, like any organization it couldn’t escape some failures. The one most frequently cited by former PARC researchers is Polos. Polos was an alternate approach to distributed computing. While Thacker and McCreight were designing the Alto, another group at PARC was working with a cluster of 12 Data General Novas, attempting to distribute functions among the machines so that one machine would handle editing, one would handle input and output, another would handle filing. “With Altos,” Sutherland said, “everything each person needed was put in each machine on a small scale. Polos was an attempt to slice the pie in a different way-to split up offices functionally.” By the time Polos was working, the Alto computers were proliferating throughout PARC, so Polos was shut down. But it had an afterlife: Sutherland distributed the 12 Novas among other Xerox divisions, where they served as the first remote gateways onto PARC’s Alto network, and the Polos displays were used as terminals within PARC until they were junked in 1977. Another major PARC project that failed was a combination optical character reader and facsimile machine. The idea was to develop a system that could take printed pages of mixed text and graphics, recognize the text as such and transmit the characters in their ASCII code, then send the rest of the material using the less-efficient facsimile coding method. “It was fabulously complicated and fairly crazy,” said Charles Simonyi, now manager of application development at Microsoft Corp. “On this project they had this incredible piece of hardware that was the equivalent of a 10,000-line Fortran program.” Un­fortunately, the equivalent of tens of thousands of lines of Fortran in those days meant tens of thousands of individual integrated circuits. “While we made substantial progress at the algorithmic and architecture level,” said Conway, who worked on the OCR project, “it became clear that with the circuit technology at that time it wouldn’t be anywhere near an economically viable thing.” The project was dropped in 1975. Essentially, the PARC researchers worked in an ivory tower for the first five years; while projects were in their infancy, there was little time for much else. But by 1976, with an Alto on every desk and electronic mail a way of life at the center, re­ searchers yearned to see their creations used by friends and neighbors. At that point, Kay recalled, about 200 Altos were in use at PARC and other Xerox divisions; PARC proposed that Xerox market a mass-production version of the Alto: the Alto III. “On Aug. 18, 1976, Xerox turned down the Alto III,” Kay said. So the researchers, rather than turning their project over to a manufacturing division, continued working with the Alto. “That was the reason for our downfall,” said Kay. “We didn’t get rid of the Altos. Xerox management had been told early on that Altos at PARC were like Kleenex; they would be used up in three years and we would need a new set of things 10 times faster. But when this fateful period came along, there was no capital. “We had a meeting at Pajaro Dunes [Calif.] called ‘Let’s burn our disk packs.’ We could sense the second derivative of progress going negative for us,” Kay related. “I really should have gone and grenaded everybody’s disks.” Instead of starting entirely new research thrusts, the PARC employees focused on getting the fruits of their past research projects out the door as products. Every few years the Xerox Corp. has a meeting of all its managers from divisions around the world to discuss where the company may be going. At the 1977 meeting, held in Boca Raton, Fla., the big event was a demonstration by PARC researchers of the systems they had built. The PARC workers assigned to the Boca Raton presentation put their hearts, souls, and many Xerox dollars into the effort. Sets were designed and built, rehearsals were held on a Holly­ wood sound stage, and Altos and Dovers were shipped between Hollywood and Palo Alto with abandon. It took an entire day to set up the exhibit in an auditorium in Boca Raton, and a special air-conditioning truck had to be rented from the local airport to keep the machines cool. But for much of the Xerox corporate staff, this was the first encounter with the “eggheads” from PARC. “PARC was a very strange place to the rest of the company... It was thought of as weird computer people who had beards, who didn’t bathe or wear shoes, who spent long hours deep into the night staring at their terminals...and who basically were antisocial egg­heads. Frankly, some of us fed that impression.”—Richard Shoup “PARC was a very strange place to the rest of the company,” Shoup said. “It was not only California, but it was nerds. It was thought of as weird computer people who had beards, who didn’t bathe or wear shoes, who spent long hours deep into the night staring at their terminals, who had no relationships with any other human beings, and who basically were antisocial egg­heads. Frankly, some of us fed that impression, as if we were above the rest of the company.” There was some difficulty in getting the rest of Xerox to take PARC researchers and their work seriously. “The presentation went over very well, and the battle was won, but the patient died,” Goldman said. Not only had Xerox executives seen the Alto, the Ethernet, and the laser printer, they had even been shown a Japanese-language word processor. “But the company couldn’t bring them to market!” Goldman said. (By 1983, the company did market a Japanese version of its Star computer.) One reason that Xerox had such trouble bringing PARC’s advances to market was that, until 1976, there was no development organization to take research prototypes from PARC and turn them into products. “At the beginning, the way in which the technology would be transferred was not explicit,” Teitelman said. “We took something of a detached view and assumed that someone was going to pick it up. It wasn’t until later on that this issue got really focused.” The Notetaker, a portable personal computer built at PARC in 1978, is rumored to have been the inspiration for the Osborne I. Even with a development organization, it was an uphill battle to get Xerox executives to accept a product. One example was the Notetaker computer, conceived by Adele Goldberg, a researcher in the Smalltalk group who is currently president of the Associa­tion for Computing Machinery and who is still at PARC. “Poor Adele,” Tesler said. “The rest of us got involved and kept redefining the project.” The Notetaker ended up as an 8086-based computer that could fit under an airplane seat. It was battery-powered, ran Smalltalk, and had a touch-sensitive screen designed by Thornburg. “We had a custom monitor, we had error-corrected memory, a lot of custom engineering that we would normally only do for a real product,” said Fairbairn, the Notetaker’s chief hardware designer. “The last year before I left PARC,” Tesler said, “I spent flying around the country talking to Xerox executives, carrying Note­taker with me. It was the first portable computer run in an air­port. Xerox executives made all sorts of promises: we’ll buy 20,000, just talk to this executive in Virginia, then talk to this executive in Connecticut. The company was so spread out, they never got the meeting together. After a year I was ready to give up.” While Xerox may not have been ready to run with a portable computer, others were. The Osborne I was introduced in 1981, about nine months after Adam Osborne reportedly toured PARC, where pictures of the Notetaker were prominently displayed. While some of PARC’s pioneers were getting restless by the mid-1970s, others were just beginning to find uses for the marvelous tools of the office of the future. One was Lynn Conway, who used the Alto, networks, and laser printers to develop a new method of designing integrated circuits and disseminate the method to hundreds of engineers at several dozen institutions around the country. When Bert Sutherland came in as manager of the Systems Science Laboratory in 1975, he brought Carver Mead, a professor at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, to PARC “to wander in and create some havoc.” Mead was an expert in semi­conductor design who had invented the MESFET in the late 1960s. Sutherland had worked on the application of computer graphics to integrated-circuit layout, Conway recalled, so it was natural for him to think about applying an advanced personal computer like the Alto to the problem of IC design. Conway herself was drawn to integrated-circuit design by the frustration of the OCR-Fax project, in which she had conceived an elegant architecture that could only be realized as racks and racks of equipment. But those racks might become a few chips if only they could be designed by someone who knew what they should do and how they should fit together. “Carver Mead came up and gave a one-week course at PARC on integrated-circuit design,” Fairbairn recalled. “Lynn Conway and I were the ones that really got excited about it and really wanted to do something.” “Then a whole bunch of things really clicked,” said Conway. “While Carver and I were cross-educating each other on what was going on in computing and in devices, he was able to explain some of the basic MOS design methods that had been evolving within Intel. And we began to see ways to generalize the struc­tures that [those designers] had generated.” Instead of working only on computer tools for design, Conway explained, she and Mead worked to make the design methods simpler and to build tools for the refined methods. “Between mid-’75 and mid-’77, things went from a fragmentary little thing—one of a number of projects Bert wanted to get going—to the point where we had it all in hand, with examples, and it was time to write.” In a little less than two years, Carver Mead and Lynn Conway had developed the concepts of scalable design rules, repetitive structures, and the rest of what is now known as structured VLSI design In a little less than two years, Mead and Conway had developed the concepts of scalable design rules, repetitive structures, and the rest of what is now known as structured VLSI design—to the point where they could teach it in a single semester. Today structured VLSI design is taught at more than 100 universities, and thousands of different chips have been built with it. But in the summer of 1977, the Mead-Conway technique was untested—in fact belittled. How could they get it accepted? “The amazing thing about the PARC environment in 1976-77 was the feeling of power; all of a sudden you could create things and make lots of them. Not just one sheet, but whole books,” said Conway. And that is exactly what she and her cohorts did. “We just self-published the thing [Introduction to VLSI Systems],” said Conway, “and put it in a form that if you didn’t look twice, you might think this was a completely sound, proven thing.” It looked like a book, and Addison-Wesley agreed to publish it as a book. Conway insisted it couldn’t have happened without the Altos. “Knowledge would have gotten out in bits and pieces, always muddied and clouded-we couldn’t have generated such a pure form and generated it so quickly.” The one tool Conway used most in the final stages of the VLSI project was networks: not only the Ethernet within PARC, but the ARPAnet that connected PARC to dozens of research sites across the country. “The one thing I am clear of in retrospect,” said Conway, “is the sense of having powerful invisible weapons that people couldn’t understand we had. The environment at PARC gave us the power to outfox and outmaneuver people who would think we were crazy or try to stop us; otherwise we would never have had the nerve to go out with it the way we did.” In 1979, three years after Alan Kay had wanted to throw away the Altos “like Kleenex,” the Dorado, a machine 10 times more powerful, finally saw the light of day. “It was supposed to be built by one of the development organizations because they were going to use it in some of their products,” recalled Severo Ornstein, one of the designers of the Dorado and now chairman of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility in Palo Alto. “But they decided not to do that, so if our lab was going to have it, we were going to have to build it ourselves. We went through a long agonizing period in which none of us who were going to have to do the work really wanted to do it.” “Taylor was running the lab by that time,” Ornstein said. “The whole thing was handled extremely dexterously. He never twisted anyone’s arm really directly; he presided over it and kept order in the process, but he really allowed the lab to figure out that that was what it had to do. It was really a good thing, too, because it was very hard to bring the Dorado to life. A lot of blood was shed.” At first, Ornstein recalled, the designers made a false start by using a new circuit-board technology—so-called multiwire technology, in which individual wires are bonded to a board to make connections. But the Dorado boards were too complex for multiwire technology. When the first Dorado ran, there was a question in many people’s minds whether there would ever be a second. “There Butler Lampson’s faith was important,” Ornstein said. “He was the only one who believed that it could be produced in quantity. In fact, even after the Dorado was redesigned using printed-circuit boards instead of multiwire and Dorados began to be built in quantity, they were still rare. “We never had enough budget to populate the whole community with Dorados,” recalled one former PARC manager. “They dribbled out each year, so that in 1984 still not everybody had a Dorado.” Those who did were envied. “I had a Dorado of my very own,” said John Warnock. “Chuck Geschke was a manager; he didn’t get one.” “In the early days...I got to take my Alto home. But the evolution of machines at Xerox went in the opposite direction from making it easy to take the stuff home.”—Dan Ingalls “I got a crusty old Alto and a sheet of paper,” Geschke said. The advent of the Dorado allowed researchers whose projects were too big for the Alto to make use of bit-mapped displays and all the other advantages of personal computers. “We had tried to put Lisp on the Alto, and it was a disaster,” recalled Teitelman. “When we got the Dorado, we spent eight or nine months dis­ cussing what we would want to see in a programming environ­ment that would combine the best of Mesa, Lisp, and Small­ talk.” The result was Cedar, now commonly acknowledged to be one of the best programming environments anywhere. “Cedar put some of the good features of Lisp into Mesa, like garbage collection and run-time type-checking,” said Mitchell of Acorn. Garbage collection is a process by which memory space that is no longer being used by a program can be reclaimed; run­ time type-checking allows a program to determine the types of its arguments—whether integers, character strings, or floating-point numbers—and choose the operations it performs on them accordingly. Interlisp, the language Teitelman had nurtured for 15 years, also was transported to the Dorado, where it was the basis for a research effort that has now grown into the Intelligent Systems Laboratory at PARC. PARC’s Smalltalk group, who had gotten used to their Altos and then built the Notetaker, another small computer, had some trouble dealing with the Dorados. “In the early days, we had Smalltalk running on an Alto, and I got to take my Alto home,” recalled Ingalls. “But the evolution of machines at Xerox went in the opposite direction from making it easy to take the stuff home. The next machine, the Dolphin, was less transportable, and the Dorado is out of the question—it’s a fire-breathing dragon.” The Dorado was the last major project to be completed by PARC in the 1970s—and the last one nurtured by many of the researchers who had made PARC famous and who in tum had been made famous by the work they did at PARC. For these researchers, it was time to move on. Alan Kay took a sabbatical beginning in March 1980 and never returned to PARC. Doug Fairbairn, Larry Tesler, and John Ellenby also left that year. In 1981 the exodus continued, with researchers including David Thornburg, Charles Simonyi, and Bert Sutherland packing their knapsacks. By June of 1984, John Warnock, Chuck Geschke, Lynn Conway, Dan Ingalls, Warren Teitelman, and Jim Mitchell had moved on. Bob Taylor had also left, taking a group of researchers with him that included Chuck Thacker and Butler Lampson. Why the sudden rush for the doors? There are probably as many reasons as there are people who left PARC. But several common threads emerge—natural career progression, frustration, the playing-out of PARC’s original charter, and a feeling among those who departed that it was time to make room for new blood. PARC hired many of its earliest employees right out of graduate school; they were roughly the same age as one another, and their careers matured along with PARC. “If you look at a championship football or basketball team,” said Teitelman, “they have somebody sitting on the bench who could start on another team. Those people usually ask to be traded.” “I saw personal computers happening without us. Xerox no longer seemed like where it was going to happen.” —Larry Tesler But some of those who left PARC recalled that a disillusionment had set in. They hadn’t been frustrated with the progression of their careers; rather, they had been frustrated with the rate of progression of their products into the real world. “We really wanted to have an impact on the world,” Mitchell said. “That was one reason we built things, that we made real things; we wanted to have a chance of making an impact.” And the world was finally ready for the PARC researchers, who until the late 1970s had few other places to go to continue the projects they were interested in. But by the early 1980s, other companies were making similar research investments-and bringing the products of that research to the commercial market­place. “We got very frustrated by seeing things like the Lisa come out,” said Mitchell, “when there were better research prototypes of such systems inside PARC.” “I saw personal computers happening without us,” said Tesler. “Xerox no longer seemed like where it was going to happen.” Tesler recalls trying to disabuse his colleagues of the notion that only PARC could build personal computers, after he met some Apple engineers. “Bob Taylor was the guy that kept insisting, ‘We have all the smart people.’ I told him, ‘There are other smart people. There are some at Apple, and I’ll bet there are some at other places, too.’ ” “‘Hire them,’ he said. I said, ‘We can’t get them all-there are hundreds of them out there, they are all over the place!’ At that moment I decided to leave.” The exodus may have begun in 1980 also because it signified a new decade. Ten years were over, and the researchers had done what they felt they had signed on to do. But, some felt, Xerox had not kept up its end of the bargain-to take their research and develop it into the “office of the future.” Some look unkindly on this “failure” of Xerox’s. Others are more philosophical. “One of the worst things that Xerox ever did was to describe something as the office of the future, because if something is the office of the future, you never finish it,” Thornburg said. “There’s never anything to ship, because once it works, it’s the office of today. And who wants to work in the office of today?” The departures may have proved beneficial for PARC’s long­ term growth. Because few researchers left during the 1970s, there was not a great deal of room for hiring new people with new ideas. “There is something about high technology, an excitement about being right out at the absolute edge and shoving as hard as we can because we can see where the digital revolution is going to go. I can’t imagine it not being exciting somewhere.” —Alvy Ray Smith “No biological organism can live in its own waste products,” Kay said. “If you have a closed system, it doesn’t matter how smart a being you have in there, it will eventually suffocate.” The exodus not only made room for new blood and new ideas within PARC but also turned out to be an efficient method of transferring PARC’s ideas to the outside world, where they have rapidly turned into products. Meanwhile, back at the lab, new research visions for PARC’s second decade have been seeded. Early efforts in VLSI have expanded, for example, to encompass a full range of fabrication and design facilities. William Spencer, now director of PARC, was the Integrated Circuits Laboratory’s first manager. The laboratory now does experimental fabrication for other areas of PARC and Xerox and is building the processor chips for the Dragon, PARC’s newest personal computer. Collaboration with several universities has led to a kit for integrating new chips into working computer systems. PARC has also found additional ways of getting products on the market: researchers in the General Science Laboratory in 1984 founded a new company, Spectra Diode Laboratories, with Xerox and Spectra-Physics Inc. funding, to commercialize PARC research on semiconductor lasers. Perhaps the strongest push in progress at PARC is in artificial intelligence, where the company is marketing Dandelion and Dorado computers that run Interlisp, along with PARC-devel­oped AI tools, including Loops, a software system that lets knowledge-engineers combine rule-based expert systems with object-oriented programming and other useful styles of knowledge representation. Loops, which was developed by three PARC researchers—formed AI Systems Business Unit, a marketing and development organization at PARC. PARC’s scattered AI groups have been consolidated into the Intelligent Systems Laboratory, which is doing research into qualitative reasoning, knowledge representation, and other topics. One interesting outgrowth of the early “office of the future” research is the Co-Lab, an experimental conference room that uses projection screens, the Ethernet, and half a dozen Dorados to help people work together and make decisions about complex projects. The next decade of advances in computer science may come from PARC—from “my grown-up baby,” as Goldman puts it. Or they may come from somewhere else. But the “architects of information” who made PARC famous have no doubt that they will come. “There is something about high technology, an excitement about being right out at the absolute edge and shoving as hard as we can because we can see where the digital revolution is going to go,” said Pixar’s Smith. “It has got to happen. I can’t imagine it not being exciting somewhere.” One statement of PARC’s charter was “to build the office of the future,” and at least one group of researchers chose to take this command literally. They built prototypes of future offices that people could work in to evaluate their quality. Two of their most dramatic creations were the Egg—a large, leathery ellipsoid with a computer and a stereo inside—and the Wheel, shown here. The Wheel, designed by Bill Bowman, an industrial designer, incorporated an adjustable Volvo seat, two adjustable monitors, and a sculptured teak desk-top and keyboard. It was mobile; the researchers envisioned that groups of Wheels could be easily rearranged as projects and working groups changed. “One day they rolled this thing out into the pasture behind PARC, with the horses eating grass around it, and had one of the secretaries sit inside and communicate to someone’s wife in Palo Alto while we took pictures,” Alvy Ray Smith recalled. Asked to describe their vision of the charter for the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center and of their role at PARC, the following group of early employees gave diverse responses: “If Xerox was going to be an interesting company in the 80’s and ’90s, it was going to have to move out beyond copiers to a broader context of dealing with information that knowledge-workers used. The office in the ’60s and ’70s used analog technology. It seemed that digital technology could be developed to allow people to work with knowledge.”—Robert Taylor, at PARC during 1970-83 and now director of Digital Equipment Corp.’s Systems Research Center. “Xerox offered 10 years of blank-check funding. They never promised to make the stuff into products; that wasn’t the charter.”—Alan Kay, 1970-81, now a research fellow at Apple Computer Inc. “PARC had three roles: to be a resource to the rest of the company, consulting and advising and assisting; to be viewed as an absolutely first-class research facility by the rest of the world; and to have some discernible impact on Xerox Corp.’s product line five years hence.”—Richard G. Shoup, 1970-79, now chairman of Aurora Systems. “What office workers are really in the business of doing is not copying pieces of paper; it’s copying information. PARC was going to make other ways of manipulating and handling that information.” —Jim Mitchell, 1971-84, now director of Acorn Computer Co.’s Palo Alto research facility. “Xerox offered 10 years of blank-check funding. They never promised to make the stuff into products; that wasn’t the charter.”—Alan Kay “Alan Kay said we were going to do a 10-year project, and I thought that at the end of 1980 we would have a Dynabook.” —Larry Tesler, 1973-80, now manager of object-oriented systems at Apple Computer Inc. “I was fresh out of graduate school. I knew I would be working with amorphous semiconductors, and that was exciting. —David Thornburg, 1971-81, now cofounder of Koala Technologies Inc. “There seemed to be a sort of open agenda as to what we did. Each of us had his own vision of what was possible.” —Dan Ingalls, 1971-84, now a principal engineer at Apple Computer Inc. “The only particular thing I remember is I figured that if Alan Kay works there, I bet I don’t have to wear a tie. I was right.”—Doug Fairbairn, 1972-80, now vice president for user-designed technology at VLSI Technologies Inc. “I wanted to make sure I wasn’t going to be put to work making copiers; they argued that the issues of software development and productivity were going to be Important to them.”—Warren Teitelman, 1972-84, now manager of programming environments at Sun Microsystems. “We would be doing good computer science in an environment in which it would eventually find its way into office products.”—Chuck Geschke, 1972-82, now executive vice president at Adobe Systems Inc. “I came to work on some special-purpose system architecture, to explore how to create custom digital hardware-software systems.”—Lynn Conway, 1973-83, now professor of electrical engineering and computer science and associate dean of engineering at the University of Michigan, after a recent stint as a manager of computer research at DARPA. “Xerox PARC had this aura of being a very far-out place. It was corporate, but it was very unusual for anything corporate to have the apparent foresight to bring some of the best people in the world together and let them do anything they wanted.” —Alvy Ray Smith, 1973-74, now director of graphics research in Lucasfilm Ltd.’s computer graphics department; soon to be vice president and chief technical officer of Pixar Inc., a spin-off of Lucasfilm. “I really didn’t have a good understanding—I don’t think anybody had. It was more a question of who we would be working with.”—Charles Simonyi, 1974-81, now manager of application development at Microsoft Corp. “It isn’t PARC’s job to develop products. PARC’s job is to develop the ideas on which we can produce a product scenario.”—John Ellenby, 1974-80, now president of Grid Systems Corp. “The charter was to explore various forms of office systems, to try things out, to develop software and systems that would be useful in offices. It made perfectly good sense to me.”—Severo Ornstein, 1974-83, now national chairman of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility. “I was hired to manage the Systems Science Lab, basically centered around using computers. Alan [Kay) was probably one of the drawing attractions.”—Bert Sutherland, 1975-81, now a founder of Sutherland, Sproull & Associates, Inc. “Very few people were hired with a specific project in mind. If you’re a researcher, it’s up to you to be a self-motivator.”—John Warnock, 1978-82, now president of Adobe Systems Inc. Almost everything developed at Xerox PARC had a special name. The Alto, of course, was named for Palo Alto, but the computers that succeeded it were a strange collection beginning with “D”—Dolphin, Dorado, Dandelion, Dragon, and Dandetiger (an upgrade of the Dandelion). The unofficial name of the recently announced Xerox 1185 workstation, Xerox’s new artificial-intelligence programming machine, was the Daisy. All of these personal computers—with their distinctive large bit-mapped screens, three-button mice, and keyboards with several unlabeled keys—are referred to as D-machines. The version of Interlisp, an artificial-intelligence language, that runs on the D-machines is known as Interlisp-D, to distinguish it from Interlisp-10, which runs on PDP-10 mainframes. EARS—the name of the first laser printer—stood for Ethernet-Alto-Research character generator-Scanning laser output terminal. Dover, Pimlico, Puffin, and Penguin are the names of its early successors: Dover was the first “production” laser printer, of which several dozen were made with depreciated Xerox 7000s bought from the copier division; Pimlico and Puffin were the first two color laser printers; and Penguin was a high-resolution black-and-white printer that replaced the Dover. The distributed-computing image at PARC, in which a network was viewed as a collection of independent agents and servers acting in concert, also led to imaginative names for individual machines. In 1983, the Knowledge Systems Area in PARC, for example, had Dolphins named Galileo, Darwin, Da Vinci, and Archimedes; Dorados named Ahwahnee, Plaza, and Waldorf; and an Alto, acting as a file server, named Ivy. The names were not merely clever but were also functional; for example, a user could “chat” with Ivy to learn statistics on disk space, the status of a particular file, or other information. “If you wanted something to last forever, you called it interim.”—Jim Mitchell In software probably the simplest progression is Smalltalk-71, Smalltalk-72, Smalltalk-76 (completed in 1977), Smalltalk-78 (completed in 1979), and Smalltalk-80(completed in 1982). In the Computer Science Laboratory, SPL (systems programming language) from the Berkeley Computer Corp. begat MPL (modular programming language), which begat Mesa, which begat Mesa-Cedar, a complete programming environment for Mesa running on D-machines. (Mesa-Cedar was later renamed Cedar to avoid confusion.) Giving software botanical names like Cedar (after items in the Sunset Garden Book) was a popular practice; Laurel was one of the first electronic-mail programs at PARC, and Juniper was an early (though unsuccessful) distributed file system. The file system in use today with some PARC hardware is IFS—the interim file system. “It got to be a joke,” said Jim Mitchell, now vice president of research at the Acorn Research Center in Palo Alto, Calif. “If you wanted something to last forever, you called it interim.” Employees rolled into PARC at all hours of the day and night. Some, like Alan Kay, did their best work from 4:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. Others tended to work late into the night to take full advantage of the computing resources, but the switch to personal computers instead of shared mainframes changed that. “The Alto didn’t run faster at night,” Warren Teitelman recalled. For some, work styles cycled. “You got up when you were rested, came in when you were ready, and worked until whenever,” Teitelman said. Bicycles were a common means of transportation. Recalled Richard Shoup: “I would ride up to the lab and down the sidewalk and right in through the front door. Still on my bike, I would ride down the hall, park outside my office, work for the day, then get on the bicycle and ride down the hall and out the front door.” Even getting a group together for lunch meant a bike trip. “One of the deals, “said Kay, “was that if you wanted to drink beer at lunch you had to bike there and back to keep from gaining weight.” Entering PARC today is much like entering any large corporation or research center: a desk where visitors sign in, identification badges for employees, and a requirement that visitors be escorted at all times. Cameras are forbidden. PARC has had a fluctuating reputation for openness. On the one hand, relatively few articles were published by its researchers in its first five years; on the other hand, the Apple Lisa was conceived in 1979 when Steve Jobs, Apple’s chairman, toured PARC and saw his first bit-mapped display. In the earliest days, recalled David Thornburg—a former PARC researcher who is now chief scientist of Koala Technologies Corp., Santa Clara, Calif.—PARC carried the open-door policy to extremes. Jack Goldman, Xerox’s vice president for research, had in fact decided to build the research center within bicycling distance of Stanford University to ensure cross-fertilization with the academic world. “People were coming in and out all the time from the artificial-intelligence lab at Stanford and from other places,” Thornburg said. “There wasn’t as much of a concern for security-we saw ourselves as a university environment where we didn’t have to teach courses.” Thornburg recalled one incident that exemplifies that open attitude. In the late spring of 1971, Goldman held a staff meeting at PARC during which he stressed the need for a way of communicating the center’s research results to Xerox at large. Thornburg remembered that Goldman told the staff, “We need to have some kind of reporting-six-monthly reports or monthly reports—so the rest of the company has a way of finding out what’s going on.” “So this one fellow,” Thornburg related, “who was sitting back in his chair raised his hand and said, ‘Well, if you ask me, Jack, what I think we should do is build a computer-based query system where we write our reports and tag the different levels of the report in terms of their depth, so somebody who just wants a summary review will get a condensed document, and someone who wants an in-depth review will get the whole document.’ ” While Goldman praised this innovative suggestion, Thornburg said, PARC researcher Bob Bauer, who was sitting next to Thornburg, suppressed laughter. The meeting broke up, and Bauer “shot out of the room into the hallway and was just laughing hysterically,” Thornburg said, continuing: “I went over to him and asked, ‘Bob, what’s so funny?’ And he said, ‘You know that guy who just gave the suggestion to Goldman?’ ” “ ‘Yes?’ ” “ ‘He doesn’t work here,’ Bauer said. ‘He’s from the Stanford Al lab, and he was over here talking with some people, and they said, Gee, we’ve got to go to a staff meeting, do you want to come along?’ ” “I don’t think Goldman ever knew that guy didn’t work for Xerox,” Thornburg said. The word went out quietly through PARC that openness had its limits, but it wasn’t yet clear where those limits were. A much more explosive incident, in terms of PARC’s reputation and its relations with the parent company, came with a 1973 article in Rolling Stone magazine that was written by Stewart Brand. Brand, creator of The Whole Earth Catalog, a bible for the 1960s, had visited PARC, as well as several other research centers, to see what its visionaries were doing. He found Alan Kay, working on the Dynabook for “us kids”; Peter Deutsch, who wrote one of the first Lisp interpreters at age 15 and had “served on every major front in computer science” while working for ARPA; and Bob Taylor, the “chief marble collector” from ARPA, who put the group together. Taylor, according to Brand, was directing his researchers on the premise that the benefits of large, centralized computers “are less than claimed.” “And that is the general bent of research at [PARC]—soft, away from hugeness and centrality, toward the small and the personal, toward putting maximum computing power in the hands of every individual who wants it,” Brand wrote. “When the article, ‘Fanatic life and symbolic death among the computer bums,’ was published [in Rolling Stone], it really upset Xerox,” recalled Alvy Ray Smith, now vice president and chief technical officer of Pixar Inc., San Rafael, Calif. “All these wild, hairy people out there in a research lab got written up—how embarrassing! I’ve recently learned that when you go out and try to raise giant money in the financial world, you don’t come across as a long hair. Xerox could not afford to have people think they were flakes.” “Jack Goldman, and I forget who else, came out to PARC right after the article was published,” Thornburg recalled. “We were all on the edges of our seats thinking the lab was going to be closed down.” “It was made crystal-clear to use that this was not all right. If it happened again, the lab was going to be shut down. That was a very sobering experience. That was about the time we began having badges and all that sort of stuff—which after all is what companies do.” When David Em, the artist, first visited PARC in 1975, such trappings of corporate security were the norm. “It was a strange environment for an artist,” he recalled. “There was a guard gate, you needed a pass, there were all sorts of access codes on the terminals.” Even today, though, PARC is not nearly as watchful as many corporate research facilities. Many students and faculty members from Stanford are consultants at PARC, carrying ideas freely back and forth, and visitors still occasionally wander the halls by themselves. And some of the regular employees—having trouble figuring out whether to clip their badges to the collars of their T-shirts or to the belt loops of their shorts—just keep them in a handy pocket.

In 1997, Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen created a sensation among venture capitalists and entrepreneurs with his book The Innovator's Dilemma. The lesson that most people remember from it is that a well-run business can’t afford to switch to a new approach—one that ultimately will replace its current business model—until it is too late. One of the most famous examples of this conundrum involved photography. The large, very profitable companies that made film for cameras knew in the mid-1990s that digital photography would be the future, but there was never really a good time for them to make the switch. At almost any point they would have lost money. So what happened, of course, was that they were displaced by new companies making digital cameras. (Yes, Fujifilm did survive, but the transition was not pretty, and it involved an improbable series of events, machinations, and radical changes.)","['lose', 'undated', 'exterior', 'view', 'center',

        How to Build a Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computer
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/fault-tolerant-quantum-computing-milestone,2022-06-01,"New study flags some clever tricks but still only hits 16-qubit size  This artist’s impression shows the conceptual framework behind an error-correction method whereby quantum bits (qubits) are shielded from faults through their gate operations. Quantum computers theoretically can solve problems no regular computer ever could within the lifetime of the universe. However, there’s a lot of engineering and tech needed to turn that “theoretically” into a working quantum device that actually begins to deliver on that promise. For starters, quantum computers have to be able to overcome their own fragility to errors. But now, in a new study, researchers have successfully developed a technique for performing any possible quantum computation in what’s called a “fault-tolerant” manner. Whereas classical computers switch transistors either on or off to symbolize data as ones or zeroes, quantum computers use quantum bits, or “qubits,” which, because of the fuzzy nature of quantum physics, can exist in a state of superposition where they are both 1 and 0 at the same time. This essentially lets each qubit perform multiple calculations at once. In theory, qubits can get connected together into universal quantum computers that can perform any potential quantum computation. The more qubits that are quantum-mechanically linked, or entangled, the more calculations they can perform at the same time. According to researchers publishing in the 25 May issue of the journal Nature, present-day, state-of-the-art quantum computers typically suffer roughly one error every 1,000 operations. However, many practical applications demand error rates lower by a billionfold or more. Scientists often hope to compensate for these high error rates by spreading quantum information across many redundant qubits. This would help quantum computers detect and correct errors, so that a cluster of a thousand or so “physical qubits,” the kinds that researchers have developed to date, can make up one useful “logical qubit.” Importantly, a “logical qubit” is something of an abstraction, not consisting of a single trapped atom or photon or whatever the medium of quantum computation—but as an entity that is able to perform actual computations and is stretched across multiple physical qubits.   However, building a fault-tolerant quantum computer will require more than scaling up to many thousands of physical qubits. Quantum computers will also need a variety of auxiliary qubits as well. When two logical qubits are connected in a quantum logic gate—the quantum computing version of the logic gates that conventional computers use to perform computations—scientists want to make sure that each physical qubit in a logical qubit interacts with only one physical qubit in the other logical qubit. This limits the disruption that could happen if a physical qubit experienced an error. Doing so requires auxiliary qubits to monitor these potential errors, increasing the complexity of these systems. Now, scientists have for the first time developed a quantum computer that can perform universal operations in a fault-tolerant manner. In the new study, the researchers experimented with a quantum computer featuring 16 physical qubits, each consisting of an electrically trapped calcium ion. The quantum information was stored in two logical qubits, each spread over seven physical qubits.     These logical qubits were connected by what’s called a transversal logical CNOT gate, which linked each physical qubit in one logical qubit with its counterpart physical qubit in the other logical qubit. The researchers also used two auxiliary qubits in a “T gate,” which helped monitor for errors. The kind of auxiliary qubits the researchers employed are called “flag qubits.” These qubits focus on detecting events where minor errors can grow to major uncorrectable errors. In theory, flag qubits should reduce the number of auxiliary qubits needed in fault-tolerant quantum computers, says study lead author Lukas Postler, a quantum physicist at the University of Innsbruck, in Austria. “I think the most exciting aspect of this work is that we see an improvement in the quality of fault-tolerant logical operations compared to their non-fault-tolerant counterparts, despite the higher complexity of the circuits,” Postler says. Such findings may help pave the way for fault-tolerant universal quantum computers, the researchers note. Charles Q. Choi is a science reporter who contributes regularly to IEEE Spectrum. He has written for Scientific American, The New York Times, Wired, and Science, among others. An almost Machiavellian plot pitted Fairchild against Texas Instruments In one corner stood the defending champion, Texas Instruments. In the other stood the challenger, Fairchild Semiconductor. The referee, judge, promoter, and only spectator was Polaroid. In contention was the contract for the electronics of Polaroid’s secret project—a pioneering product introduced in 1972 as the SX-70, a camera eventually purchased by millions of people. As the embodiment of truly automated instant photography, the SX-70 fulfilled a long-held dream of Edwin Land, founder of Polaroid Corp., Cambridge, Mass. Vital to this “point and shoot” capability was a new film—one that would develop while exposed to light and so eliminate the tear-away covers of previous Polaroid films. Also vital were sophisticated electronics to control all single lens reflex (SLR) camera functions, including flashbulb selection, exposure control, mirror positioning, start of print development, and ejection of print. These circuits were divided into three modules, one each for motor, exposure and logic, and flash control. At the final count, some 400 transistors were used.

        Can Cryptocurrencies Actually Be Legal Tender? Should They?
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/should-cryptocurrencies-be-legal-tender,2022-05-30," Following El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin, efforts to legalize crypto are spreading  When the blueprint for Bitcoin was unveiled in 2008, the goal was to create a new form of electronic cash that bypassed traditional financial institutions. Since then, the original cryptocurrency and its descendants have primarily become investments rather than practical forms of payment. But now a handful of experiments are trying to bring the technology back to its roots by making it legal tender. Legal tender refers to forms of money the law says must be accepted in payment of a debt. Most countries designate only their domestic currencies this way, though some adopt foreign currencies either exclusively or alongside their own. Last year, however, El Salvador became the first country to adopt a cryptocurrency as legal tender. The country had already adopted the U.S. dollar as its main currency in 2001, but following new legislation the bitcoin joined it on 7 September. This has sparked similar efforts elsewhere, with the Central African Republic becoming the second country to make bitcoins legal tender in April. Meanwhile, there are proposals to do the same at the regional level in the United States and elsewhere. But this new push to legitimize cryptocurrencies as a form of payment is raising questions about how well suited they are to the role. “A good legal tender is something that is reliable,” says Thomas Dimpfl, a professor of economics at the University of Hohenheim in Germany. “The biggest risk is that it [bitcoin] is just so volatile.” “My goal was to put it on the government’s radar and get them to start thinking about how to legislate in this space.”—Ian Calderon, California State Assembly While the value of all currencies vary over time, cryptocurrencies often fluctuate wildly, as demonstrated by the recent crypto crash that has seen the value of the bitcoin fall by more than half since last November’s highs. This makes using it as a true currency difficult, says Dimpfl, because unless you receive all payments in bitcoins and can pay all bills in bitcoins, at some point you need to convert them into traditional fiat currencies. This exposes both everyday users and businesses to significant exchange-rate risks, he adds. It’s also proven a significant problem for El Salvador’s government. As part of its effort to popularize the new currency, it has spent US $104 million buying bitcoins, according to Reuters. But following the recent crash, the value of the heavily indebted nation’s holdings is just $67.9 million. Nonetheless, advocates for adopting cryptocurrencies as legal tender believe the dangers can be mitigated and the benefits could be substantial. The Swiss city of Lugano recently announced plans to accept bitcoins, Tether (a stablecoin pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar) and LVGA (a Swiss Franc–based stablecoin launched by the city in 2020) as “de facto” legal tender. While only the Swiss federal government can designate something as legal tender, the city will allow all payments to the authorities to be made in the three cryptocurrencies by October and is encouraging local businesses to accept them too. “Eventually you will, in practice, be able to live most of your experiences in Lugano in those three cryptocurrencies,” says Pietro Poretti, director of the city’s economic-development division. The city is currently negotiating with service providers, but the final solution will include the ability to instantly convert any cryptocurrency into Swiss francs. This is partly because the local government is not legally permitted to hold cryptocurrencies on it books, says Poretti, but also due to feedback from local businesses that highlighted instant conversion as a priority. That raises the question, why take payments in cryptocurrencies in the first place? But Poretti sees multiple benefits. For a start, the city is trying to establish itself as a center of excellence for blockchain development, and it’s hard to do that without supporting the technology’s main application. But beyond that, it could give the local economy a boost by pulling in crypto enthusiasts, he says, and give the city a crucial head start in what he thinks is likely to be an important technology in the future. “It certainly doesn't do any harm being equipped for what is coming, to be ahead of the curve rather than catching up,” he says. Bitcoin is certainly free of the manipulation of central banks. But, says Thomas Dimpfl of the University of Hohenheim, it wound up only transferring that right “to traders and speculators to manipulate the price.”  Lugano isn’t the only place keen to get ahead of the curve. Last year, Texas ratified a bill recognizing the legal status of “virtual currencies,” and lawmakers in both Arizona and California have tabled “legal tender” bills this year. Only the federal government has the right to designate legal tender, so the Arizona bill is doomed to fail—while the California bill ultimately settled for the less ambitious goal of affirming the legality of accepting cryptocurrencies as payment. But that could still be significant, says Ian Calderon, a former majority leader for the Democrats in the California State Assembly who helped lead the effort. While there is nothing in the law preventing businesses or local governments from accepting payment in cryptocurrencies, he says legal ambiguity is suppressing adoption. The bill was designed to provide the confidence for people to experiment with the technology, which Calderon believes could play an important role in boosting financial inclusion thanks to its lower fees compared to traditional banking. The bill, which is unlikely to be debated this year, was also designed to force politicians to engage with the need to regulate the sector. “Historically, California has always been the cradle of technology and we’ve always had the ability to impact tech policy,” he says. “My goal was to put it on the government’s radar and get them to start thinking about how to legislate in this space.” But the case of El Salvador suggests that even with considerable government support, cryptocurrencies may struggle to establish themselves as viable cash replacements. Although El Salvador offered all residents $30’s worth of Bitcoin for downloading the government-backed Chivo wallet, a paper published in April by economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research, found that only 20 percent continued to use it once they’d spent the bonus. The leading reason for not using bitcoins was a lack of understanding, but a lack of trust in the currency and its volatility also ranked highly. Trust is an important ingredient for an effective currency, says Drimpfl. People trust the dollar because it is backed by the economy of the United States—and because they know that the Federal Reserve can intervene if needed to keep prices stable. This is done by manipulating the supply of money through interest-rate adjustments or buying government bonds. To a certain extent, increased adoption of cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment could help reduce their volatility by boosting the size of the crypto economy, says Dimpfl. But supply is typically governed by mathematical protocols that set out rules for how new coins can be minted.  That is a deliberate choice, because advocates of cryptocurrencies claim the manipulation of money supply by central banks creates economic bubbles and financial crises. But it also takes away a vital lever to react to changing global circumstances, says Dimpfl, and the evidence suggests it hasn’t reduced spikes and crashes. “They left it to traders and speculators to manipulate the price,” he adds. Stablecoins, whose value is pegged to a traditional fiat currency, offer a potential workaround to these problems, says Drimpfl. But the recent collapse in value of the dollar-based Terra and wobbles in the price of other prominent coins suggest this is far from guaranteed.

        IBM’s Target: a 4,000-Qubit Processor by 2025
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/ibm-quantum-computer,2022-05-10," But an “intelligent software layer” will be key to doing anything useful with it IBM Quantum scientist Maika Takita in the IBM Quantum lab at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, N.Y.  An update to IBM’s quantum-computing road map now says the company is on course to build a 4,000-qubit machine by 2025. But getting the device to do anything useful will require the development of a powerful new software stack that will help manage errors, share the load with classical hardware, and simplify the programming process. Since IBM first unveiled its quantum hardware plans in 2020, the company has largely kept to the schedule; the most recent milestone from that forecast that has come to fruition was the release of the company’s 127-qubit Eagle processor last November. The first iteration of the road map topped out with the 1,121 Condor processor that is scheduled for release in 2023, but now the company has revealed plans for a 1,386-qubit processor, called Flamingo, to appear in 2024 and for a 4,158-qubit device called Kookaburra to make its debut in 2025. Key to building these devices will be a new modular architecture in which multiple chips are connected to create a single large processor. This will be made possible by new short-range couplers, which allow communication between qubits on adjacent chips, and cryogenic microwave cables, which allow longer-range connections between different processors. Kookaburra, due in 2025, will have 4,158+ qubits.IBM But quantum hardware is error-prone and fiendishly complex, so simply wiring large numbers of qubits together doesn’t necessarily mean you can do much practical work with them. IBM thinks the key to tapping the power of these extra qubits will be an “intelligent software layer” that augments its quantum chips with classical tools that can help manage noise and amplify their processing power. “We believe that classical resources can really enhance what you can do with quantum and get the most out of that quantum resource,” says Blake Johnson, IBM’s quantum platform lead. “And so we need to build tooling—an orchestration layer if you will–that can allow quantum and classical computations to work together in a seamless way.” The most fundamental challenge for quantum hardware remains its inherent noisiness, and Johnson says there is “a furious amount of research activity” going on to scale up error-mitigation techniques. So far, most innovations have been tested only on smaller systems. But Johnson says early results suggest that an approach known as probabilistic error cancellation will work on devices the size of those envisioned by IBM at the end of its quantum road map. The technique involves deliberately running noisy versions of quantum circuits to learn the contours of that noise, then using postprocessing on classical computers to reduce the level of error in answers. Applying these kinds of techniques requires considerable specialist knowledge, though. That limits the techniques’ usefulness for the average developer. That’s why, from 2024 forward, IBM plans to build error mitigation directly into its Qiskit Runtime software development platform so users can build programs without having to think specifically about how to reduce the noise. “We want these things to be automatic for the user,” says Johnson. “You shouldn't have to be a quantum control expert in order to get meaningful results out of a quantum compute.” Beyond suppressing errors, IBM is also planning new software tools designed to speed up users’ applications and help them tackle larger problems. Last month, the company released two “primitives”–predefined basic programs that carry out core quantum operations–that users of Qiskit runtime can use to build applications. Starting in 2023, IBM will make it possible to run these primitives in parallel across multiple quantum processors, significantly speeding up users’ programs. IBM’s ambitions also include letting developers build complex programs that combine both classical and quantum elements. That’s because many developers would like to bring quantum capabilities into specific parts of their existing workflows, says Johnson, and also because it could help tackle problems larger than the quantum hardware is capable of solving by itself.  Central to this quantum-classic mashup idea is the concept of “circuit knitting.” This is a family of techniques that split quantum computing problems into chunks that can be run on multiple processors in parallel, before using classical computers to jump in to stitch the results back together again. In a proof of concept last year, IBM researchers showed that they could use a circuit-knitting approach called entanglement forging to double the size of quantum system that can be simulated on a given number of qubits. By 2025, the company plans to introduce a toolbox of circuit-knitting methods, which developers will be able to use to build algorithms that make the best of both classical and quantum resources. To support this, they will also adopt a “quantum serverless” approach in which developers don’t need to think about what hardware is required to run their code, and quantum or classical resources are provided automatically as needed. “The serverless model allows the developer to focus on their code, use resources on demand when they need them, and have access to a variety of infrastructure resources without being an expert in the infrastructures themselves,” says Johnson. The company’s road map predicts that all those things will likely come together by 2025, letting developers start producing full-blown applications for things like machine learning, optimization, and physical simulations.

An almost Machiavellian plot pitted Fairchild against Texas Instruments In one corner stood the defending champion, Texas Instruments. In the other stood the challenger, Fairchild Semiconductor. The referee, judge, promoter, and only spectator was Polaroid. In contention was the contract for the electronics of Polaroid’s secret project—a pioneering product introduced in 1972 as the SX-70, a camera eventually purchased by millions of people. As the embodiment of truly automated instant photography, the SX-70 fulfilled a long-held dream of Edwin Land, founder of Polaroid Corp., Cambridge, Mass. Vital to this “point and shoot” capability was a new film—one that would develop while exposed to light and so eliminate the tear-away covers of previous Polaroid films.

These circuits were divided into three modules, one each for motor, exposure and logic, and flash control. At the final count, some 400 transistors were used.                                                                             "," But an “intelligent software layer” will be key to doing anything useful with it IBM Quantum scientist Maika Takita in the IBM Quantum lab at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, N.Y. An update to IBM’s quantum-computing road map now says the company is on course to build a 4,000-qubit machine by 2025. But getting the device to do anything useful will require the development of a powerful new software stack that will help manage errors, share the load with classical hardware, and simplify the programming process. Since IBM first unveiled its quantum hardware plans in 2020, the company has largely kept to the schedule; the most recent milestone from that forecast that has come to fruition was the release of the company’s 127-qubit Eagle processor last November. The first iteration of the road map topped out with the 1,121 Condor processor that is scheduled for release in 2023, but now the company has revealed plans for a 1,386-qubit processor, called Flamingo, to appear in 2024 and for a 4,158-qubit device called Kookaburra to make its debut in 2025. Key to building these devices will be a new modular architecture in which multiple chips are connected to create a single large processor. This will be made possible by new short-range couplers, which allow communication between qubits on adjacent chips, and cryogenic microwave cables, which allow longer-range connections between different processors. Kookaburra, due in 2025, will have 4,158+ qubits.IBM But quantum hardware is error-prone and fiendishly complex, so simply wiring large numbers of qubits together doesn’t necessarily mean you can do much practical work with them. IBM thinks the key to tapping the power of these extra qubits will be an “intelligent software layer” that augments its quantum chips with classical tools that can help manage noise and amplify their processing power. “We believe that classical resources can really enhance what you can do with quantum and get the most out of that quantum resource,” says Blake Johnson, IBM’s quantum platform lead. “And so we need to build tooling—an orchestration layer if you will–that can allow quantum and classical computations to work together in a seamless way.” The most fundamental challenge for quantum hardware remains its inherent noisiness, and Johnson says there is “a furious amount of research activity” going on to scale up error-mitigation techniques. So far, most innovations have been tested only on smaller systems. But Johnson says early results suggest that an approach known as probabilistic error cancellation will work on devices the size of those envisioned by IBM at the end of its quantum road map. The technique involves deliberately running noisy versions of quantum circuits to learn the contours of that noise, then using postprocessing on classical computers to reduce the level of error in answers. Applying these kinds of techniques requires considerable specialist knowledge, though. That limits the techniques’ usefulness for the average developer. That’s why, from 2024 forward, IBM plans to build error mitigation directly into its Qiskit Runtime software development platform so users can build programs without having to think specifically about how to reduce the noise. “We want these things to be automatic for the user,” says Johnson. “You shouldn't have to be a quantum control expert in order to get meaningful results out of a quantum compute.” Beyond suppressing errors, IBM is also planning new software tools designed to speed up users’ applications and help them tackle larger problems. Last month, the company released two “primitives”–predefined basic programs that carry out core quantum operations–that users of Qiskit runtime can use to build applications. Starting in 2023, IBM will make it possible to run these primitives in parallel across multiple quantum processors, significantly speeding up users’ programs. IBM’s ambitions also include letting developers build complex programs that combine both classical and quantum elements. That’s because many developers would like to bring quantum capabilities into specific parts of their existing workflows, says Johnson, and also because it could help tackle problems larger than the quantum hardware is capable of solving by itself. Central to this quantum-classic mashup idea is the concept of “circuit knitting.” This is a family of techniques that split quantum computing problems into chunks that can be run on multiple processors in parallel, before using classical computers to jump in to stitch the results back together again. In a proof of concept last year, IBM researchers showed that they could use a circuit-knitting approach called entanglement forging to double the size of quantum system that can be simulated on a given number of qubits. By 2025, the company plans to introduce a toolbox of circuit-knitting methods, which developers will be able to use to build algorithms that make the best of both classical and quantum resources. To support this, they will also adopt a “quantum serverless” approach in which developers don’t need to think about what hardware is required to run their code, and quantum or classical resources are provided automatically as needed. “The serverless model allows the developer to focus on their code, use resources on demand when they need them, and have access to a variety of infrastructure resources without being an expert in the infrastructures themselves,” says Johnson. The company’s road map predicts that all those things will likely come together by 2025, letting developers start producing full-blown applications for things like machine learning, optimization, and physical simulations.

        Frozen Neon Invention Jolts Quantum Computer Race
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/neon-qubit,2022-05-04,"Single electrons trapped on solid neon could serve as highly stable qubits A superconducting microwave resonator (gold curves) can use microwaves (pale beam) to help control a single isolated electron (orange waves) trapped on a block of solid frozen neon (green block).

Quantum computers can theoretically find the answers to problems no classical computer could ever solve, but they rely on infamously unstable components known as qubits. New findings now suggests that electrons trapped on frozen solid neon could prove a simple yet powerful kind of qubit for use in future quantum computers. Qubits, or quantum bits, rely on the bizarre nature of quantum physics, which suggests that electrons, atoms and other building blocks of the universe can exist in a state known as superposition where they are essentially spin in two opposite directions at once or exist in two or more places at the same time. By placing many qubits into superposition, a quantum computer can in theory perform a mind-boggling number of computations simultaneously. Amazon, Google, IBM, and many others are racing to create a practical quantum computer from a variety of qubit platforms, such as superconducting loops, electromagnetically trapped ions and spins within silicon.

Neon freezes into a solid when cooled to below roughly minus 248.6 degrees C and brought to pressures of more than 0.42 atmospheres.

The researchers chose one of the simplest possible qubits for their design—single electrons. They froze neon at a temperature one-hundredth of a degree above absolute zero on a microchip and then used a tiny light bulb filament to spray electrons at it. ""When you bring the electron near the surface of the neon, the electrons in the neon atoms get slightly rearranged and repelled by the electron, because like charges repel, but because the neon is neutral, this slight repulsion of electrons leaves a slightly positive charge that attracts the electron to the surface,"" says study co-senior author Kater Murch, a quantum physicist at Washington University in St. Louis. However, this electron cannot penetrate the surface of the neon, since all of the neon's electrons' energy levels are filled, ""so it is repelled from actually contacting the surface.""

        Inventing Postscript, the Tech That Took the Pain out of Printing
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/adobe-postscript,2022-04-23,"Adobe’s founders and engineers tell a tale of software, stumbles, and serendipity Time and again, in his earliest attempts at controlling laser printers, John Warnock got the message, “Page Too Complex,” from a recalcitrant machine. Any system he designed, he vowed, would have to have a “Print Anything” architecture. That goal led ultimately to a page description language called PostScript, today the de facto standard of desktop publishing. This article was first published as ""‘PostScript’ prints anything: a case history."" It appeared in the May 1988 issue of IEEE Spectrum. A PDF version is available on IEEE Xplore. The diagrams and photographs appeared in the original print version. Back then, Warnock already had a rough idea how to “Print Anything.” But later he ran into a different obstacle, when his employer, Xerox Corp., proved loath to support a truly standard language. So off he went, with Charles Geschke and several other colleagues, to found Adobe Systems Inc. in Mountain View, Calif. By that time, PostScript was only two major pieces of research away, although one—the development of type font algorithms—was “a research project that had to succeed,” says Warnock, and the other had been described as one of the world’s most difficult problems. The rest is desktop publishing history. PostScript can truly do anything, though extremely complex images can take as much as an hour of computation time. It first appeared in the Apple LaserWriter, which was introduced in January of 1985. Today it has been adopted by 23 manufacturers of laser printers, with more still signing on. This story is as much about luck and guts as about matters of principle and brilliant software engineering. Still, this story is as much about luck and guts as about matters of principle and brilliant software engineering. It would have been quite different had Warnock and company not been in the right place at the right time to meet the right person. The time was right because of the imminence of three hardware developments: the first low-cost, bit-mapped personal computer, the first low-cost laser printer, and a decline in price of high-density memory chips. And the right person was Apple founder Steven Jobs, who invented the first, hoped for the second, and told Adobe to tough out the third. Device-independent software Software not directly tied to a specific piece of hardware. Interpreter A program that translates an instruction in the source code of a high-level language into machine language by deciding on the fly what machine instructions best translate it before moving onto the next instruction in source code. Laser printer A device that, like a xerographic copier, draws an image on a drum, but with a laser beam instead of lenses; applies toner to the charged image area; and transfers the toner to a sheet of paper, melting it into the paper to set the image. Page description language A method of expressing the appearance of a printed image, including text, lines, and bit-mapped photographs. Postfix notation Also known as reverse Polish notation, the appearance of operators after the data on which they are to operate; thus 2 + 2 becomes 2 2 +. Today laser printers are rapidly replacing the daisy-wheel printers in the office, pushing out letter-quality type as their laser obeys the commands of simple software. But given more sophisticated software like PostScript, laser printers can do far more. They can print many different type fonts and make the letters dance around the page hand in hand with drawings and photographs. PostScript does all this implies—draws lines and curves, tilts text at arbitrary angles, or shades a photograph in various tones of gray. It is as complete and flexible a programming language as Pascal or C or Forth, having variables, loops, conditionals, operators, and routines and offering any number of ways to get the same output. The PostScript program is created on the computer either by someone using the language or by desktop publishing software or other applications software that translates, say, the movements of a mouse into a PostScript program. (Other page description languages are optimized for one of these purposes, not both.) That program is sent over a local-area network or through an RS-232 port to the laser printer. There it is converted into instructions for the printer by the PostScript interpreter, software resident in ROM. On the same circuit board as up to 2 megabytes of ROM is a Motorola 68000 series processor, which executes the instructions and causes the pages to be printed. Things were more elementary with the first laser printers, which were in regular use at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in the mid-1970s. They were controlled by a printing protocol called Press, which was not a programming language but a set of instructions that sent image data to a printer in a steady stream. It handled letters and simple images well, but for anything more detailed, got the printer to return the message: “Page Too Complex.” Thereupon the typical PARC engineer would simplify the image. But when Warnock, a computer scientist with a Ph.D. from the University of Utah, joined the center in 1978, he immediately began work on a new printer protocol. Six years of experience at Evans & Sutherland in Mountain View, Calif., had taught him where to start. 
	Adobe Systems founders John Warnock (right) and Charles Geschke visited Adobe Creek, inspiration for their company’s name. A dry winter has slowed the creek to a trickle, but the company has had anything but a dry year. The entrepreneurs in 1982 found Adobe a suitable name since the creek meandered near both their domes and, even more important, had none of the Qs, Xs, Ys, and Zs then popular with high-tech startups.

But when Warnock, a computer scientist with a Ph.D. from the University of Utah, joined the center in 1978, he immediately began work on a new printer protocol. Six years of experience at Evans & Sutherland in Mountain View, Calif., had taught him where to start. In 1971, Evans & Sutherland had undertaken to equip the New York Maritime Academy with a simulator for training harbor pilots. The trainees were to sit on the mockup of a ship’s bridge, surrounded by five 12-foot-high, 30-ft-long (3.6-by-9 meter) screens displaying a computer-generated representation of New York Harbor, complete with buildings, piers, movable buoys, changing weather conditions, and other ships to be avoided. The system had to produce images in full color for five projectors at 30 frames a second. Evans & Sutherland had never produced anything as complex. It let time slip by until, with only one of the contract’s three years left, “everybody hit the panic button,” Warnock says. So to save time, the company had the hardware and software developed in parallel, the first in Utah and the second by a team led by Warnock in California. The rush planted the first two seeds for what was to become PostScript. Obviously, a database listing everything in the harbor was both essential and would have to be built in total ignorance as to the hardware it would eventually run on. So Warnock’s team decided to invent a language unrelated to any computer. Only when the simulator hardware was ready would they build a compiler to translate the database into the appropriate machine language. Meanwhile, feeding information about the harbor into the database proved arduous. Putting maps on a digitizing tablet and touching them with a stylus at numerous points was not so bad; but using a keyboard to enter the details—whether the point touched was a pier of a certain type or a building or an island—was slow going. To make this task easier, John Gaffney, one of Warnock’s group, spent a weekend writing a software routine that would generate the information about the objects from menus. Because the PostScript Language treats text like any other graphic object, it can be scaled to any size and rotate to any angle. PostScript was the first page description language to be able to produce such a spiral of type. Adobe Systems Inc. By the time the harbor simulator was completed, only slightly behind schedule, Warnock had discovered how powerful an object-oriented language is. Unlike Basic or Fortran, say, which require the user to spell out every last instruction, it packs all those details into modules, or objects, which the user controls with just a few directives. Warnock had also discovered that making software device-independent “gives you a great deal of leverage and flexibility.” Those lessons learned, his group turned to expanding Gaffney’s little interpreter into a full programming system for computer-aided design (CAD). In 1977, that project was released by Evans & Sutherland as The Design System. “It had an interactive, stack-oriented architecture,” Gaffney said, “with simple commands for pushing and popping arguments onto and from the stack and a rich dictionary for look-ups.” (Such an architecture stores data as it is received, stacking it like a pile of books. A command like “add” would “pop” the topmost pieces of data from the stack, act on them, and “push” the result back on the pile.) Only one copy of The Design System was ever released, as a test bed for the final development, but the other company’s project director died and The Design System died with him. Warnock, however, took the stack and dictionary ideas—along with what he had learned from the harbor project—to PARC. PARC was then using a programming language called Mesa. In 1978, soon after arriving at the center, Warnock persuaded another Xerox researcher, Martin Newell, to help him re-create The Design System in Mesa. The result, called Jam, for John and Martin, proved the concepts he brought from Evans & Sutherland were appropriate for laser printing. Jam was object oriented and device independent, like the harbor simulator, and in some ways simpler than The Design System, because printing requires only two dimensions, versus CAD’s three. But it needed a few features, such as type fonts, found in neither of its ancestors. Moreover, Warnock recalls, “Xerox was using a different printing scheme on every printer. The Star workstations [then being developed] were crumbling under the load of trying to drive them all differently.” So Warnock and a group of researchers headed by Charles Geschke set out to merge Jam with the older Press protocol into Interpress, a standard, device-independent language capable of driving all Xerox Corp.’s laser printers. Interpress was completed in 1981, but unhappily, the end was not in sight. Because of the compromise between Jam and Press, “the language became complicated in its redesign,” Warnock says. And Xerox begged the issue of standardization by producing several versions of the language, so the company’s older laser printers could run some form of it. The commands of the PostScript programming language are optimized for graphics. This elongated word “Spectrum” was generated by the PostScript program shown below it. The first group of commands (red) identify a typeface from PostScript’s library of typefaces and enlarge it to 50 points from the 1-point size in which it is stored (in typesetting, there are 72 points to the inch). The next group of commands (blue) tells the laser printer at which point on the page to anchor the lower left corner of the word. The next command (yellow) stretches the typeface vertically, while leaving it unaltered horizontally. The final commands (purple) specify the letters to be drawn and order the printer to produce the image. A special program editor transmits the instructions to the printer. Adobe Systems Inc. Worst of all, to Warnock, was the insistence that printers always run at their rated speeds. Since a 20-page-per-minute printer could not produce anything very complex in three seconds, he was back facing his “Page Too Complex” nemesis. The constraint derived from the copier business, Geschke explains, where “pricing of leased machines was based on copies per day. But in electronic printing, in our opinion, function was most important, so there was a real variance between our and the Xerox position.” All the same, in the belief that any standard was better than none, Warnock and Geschke began promoting Interpress within Xerox Corp. Eventually, they won—sort of. But Xerox added, Warnock recalls, “’We’re going to keep it a secret because it is so wonderful and if we publish it the Japanese might implement it before we do.’ “Gee,’ I said, ‘A secret standard—I find this a hard concept to understand.’” Convinced that Xerox was making a mistake, Warnock and Geschke left PARC to implement their page description language once again, but this time within a corporation they controlled. With the help of David Evans of Evans & Sutherland and William Hambrecht of Hambrecht and Quist, a San Francisco-based venture capital firm, they wrote a business plan and incorporated in December of 1982. They intended both to sell this setup as a turnkey system and to franchise the publishing equivalent of a one-hour photo store. Desktop publishing, though, was not what Warnock and Geschke at first had in mind. The system they foresaw consisted of a workstation linked by a device-independent, page-description language like Jam to a laser printer for draft printing, a photo-typesetter for the final output, and whatever other output device they might later add. No other publishing package then available used the same software for different output devices. And they intended both to sell this setup as a turnkey system and to franchise the publishing equivalent of a one-hour photo store. Adobe then consisted of Warnock, Geschke, and a core of other engineers hired from PARC: Daniel Putman, Thomas Boynton, and Douglas Brotz. As they planned to buy whatever hardware they needed after they had perfected their programming language, they focused first on Jam. They worked in C, on a VAX 750 running Berkeley Unix, to develop the language, and they tested in on a Sun workstation driving a full-size laser printer that they had borrowed from Digital Equipment Corp. “At that time,” recalls Putman, “most companies required that we spell our names and pay in cash, so we had to beg, borrow, and steal the tools to prototype PostScript.” To avoid copyright problems, they licensed The Design System concepts from Evans & Sutherland. They were free to use their PARC research results, as those had been published. For years theoreticians have suggested means of breaking images into their line segments, but their algorithms tended to fall apart when faced with difficult cases—large numbers of lines intersecting at a single point, for example (inset). The Adobe team says it has solved this problem with a proprietary algorithm with the results illustrated here. The image was created with Adobe Illustrator, a drawing program that runs on the Apple Macintosh personal computer, and was printed on the ColorScript 100, the first color PostScript printer, released in April by QMS Inc. of Mobile, Ala. Warnock and Geschke were not close-mouthed about their plans, and soon not only Jobs heard (he was then chairman of Apple Computer Inc. of Cupertino, Calif.) but also C. Gordon Bell, then vice president of engineering at Digital Equipment in Maynard, Mass. Bell told the pair that six research teams at Digital had been trying for years to devise a decent means of driving its laser printers, and if Adobe could solve the problem, Digital would be interested in licensing the solution. Jobs had been facing a similar problem. The Macintosh was well into development, but without a letter-quality printer would go nowhere in the business market. Daisy-wheel printers were out of the question, because they could not produce the bit-mapped graphics basic to the Macintosh. But Apple’s own engineers could not get high-quality graphics out of a laser printer in time for the Macintosh introduction. Jobs suggested that Adobe become a software company, sell to manufacturers instead of at retail, and negotiate a licensing agreement with Apple. Undeterred, Jobs and Robert Belleville, then director of engineering for Apple and now director of strategic planning for Convergent Technologies Inc., San Jose, Calif., had dreamed up the perfect Macintosh laser printer—one that could produce all the fonts in the world with no help from a disk drive. But they lacked “the slightest idea of how to do this,” says Belleville, until he ran into Putman at a cocktail party, heard what Adobe was doing, and brought Jobs over for a visit. “I was overjoyed!” recalls Belleville. “Their system could do simple things fast and also do full graphics and scanned images. And when I saw font scaling was possible across such wide ranges, we were sold.” Jobs suggested that Adobe become a software company, sell to manufacturers instead of at retail, and negotiate a licensing agreement with Apple. Adobe liked the idea, signed the agreement with Apple at the end of 1983, and much to Hambrecht & Quist’s surprise, showed a profit at the end of its first year. Reimplementing the Jam language with its object orientation, stacks, postfix notation (in which operands precede their operators), and dictionary was relatively straightforward. Most of the research had been completed at Evans & Sutherland and at PARC. Basically all Adobe had to do was engineer it into a product, named PostScript after the postfix notation it uses and because it was to be the last thing that happened to an image before it was printed. Also, since the product had to “Print Anything,” it had to put functionality above speed and cost—the three factors traded off in the design of microprocessor systems like the one that would control the laser printer, explains Putman, now vice president of engineering at Adobe. Still, two key breakthroughs remained to be made. One of them was creating the font algorithms, proprietary formulas for the creation of text. “Even with Interpress,” says William Paxton, director of advanced development for Adobe, “fonts were a wart on the side of an otherwise elegant design.” Interpress could do arbitrary transformations, like scale and rotate, on images, but in its early versions could not do them on bit-mapped text without degrading its quality. PostScript, however, unifies text and graphics by storing the fonts as outline representations of the letters, not as bit maps. Back in early 1983, however, this unification was easier to propose than to realize. “Getting high-quality fonts from outline representations of characters was seen as an insoluble problem,” Warnock says, because it was hard to produce smooth curves of varying widths without jagged edges. Print quality seemed unobtainable from anything less than a phototypesetter. But in mid-1983, Warnock says, he had an idea for a fundamentally new set of algorithms that might do the trick. His initial experiments promised success, so he set Paxton to refining the algorithms. The results are proprietary and are encrypted inside the ROMs that contain PostScript instructions because this font technology is the key distinction between Adobe’s product and others. So successful was Adobe’s solution to the font problem that Linotype, Letraset, and other owners of the most popular typeface designs were willing for the first time to license the outline representations of their typefaces. No earlier technology had done them justice. (Ironically, Adobe is now licensing its font technology to Linotype, and Linotype is converting its entire library of some 2000 fonts into PostScript representations.) Adobe’s other technical breakthrough is the algorithm, called Reducer, that breaks down complex shapes into simpler ones easier for PostScript to describe. Such an algorithm is a key component of any graphics language, and theoretical papers about a universal form of it were numerous: but, says Brotz, “they tended to gloss over the hard cases that arise in real applications—figures with large amounts of data and multiple intersections at the same point, for example.” So when the page printed, certain images would come out badly fragmented or warped, violating Adobe’s “Print Anything” rule. “About a week after I had joined Adobe in 1983,” Brotz recalls, “John Warnock mentioned this rather important algorithm that had to be written. And I, with no graphics background, volunteered. Several months later, older and wiser, I realized it truly was one of the world’s hardest problems.” But Brotz did not give up, and he says, “We have now an exactly correct reducer algorithm. It is the heart of the graphics system in PostScript.” And a tally Brotz keeps reveals that no bugs have been discovered in the Reducer in more than two years. 
	“Warnock promptly labeled [the procedure] ‘Andy’s Stupid Input Device'....[but] it turned out that Andy’s Stupid Input Device was the lowest common denominator and all the special-case code could disappear.” —Douglas Brotz
 Adobe had agreed to deliver its software for installation into the LaserWriter during the summer of 1984. But because of marketing and manufacturing concerns, the LaserWriter itself was to be introduced in January of 1985. So the Adobe engineers used the time to tighten the code (the final release contained some 200,000 bytes) and fine-tune the algorithms. They also made some more specific changes. One had to do with handling input devices. As originally conceived, PostScript was to have been independent of the output, but not the input, device. Warnock had thought that PostScript, to take in scanned images, would need to contain information about a wide range of optical scanners. But Brotz, after programming the parameters of just two of many scanner types, realized that the task was not only horrendous and repetitive but ate up a lot of memory. Andy Shore, an Adobe computer scientist, overheard him complaining one day and suggested writing a PostScript procedure that would pretend that it was an input device and spit out the image information in a standard format, regardless of the characteristics of the actual standard. Brotz did not think it would work and “Warnock promptly labeled it ‘Andy’s Stupid Input Device.'” Still, Brotz thought it might be helpful for generating test patterns, and when he implemented it, “it turned out that Andy’s Stupid Input Device was the lowest common denominator and all the special-case code could disappear.” Problems arise only when the image data has been compressed for transmission or storage; the programmer then has to insert a routine to decompress the data before it is handed to the image algorithm. Another improvement involved performance profiling—running various tests to see what frequently used functions slowed down operation. Floating-point routines were the chief culprits because they are computationally intensive. So the team took some of the algorithms for the common operations, such as breaking curves into vectors and drawing outlines, and rewrote them in less flexible fixed-point arithmetic. Now only when fixed-point arithmetic would be too imprecise does the interpreter call the floating-point routine. “So with no loss of generality,” says Edward Taft, Adobe senior computer scientist, “we were handling 99 percent of the cases five times faster than we were before.” To improve the other 1 percent, Belleville sent one of his engineers over from Apple—Jerome Coonen, a recognized expert in floating point. He optimized the algorithms so, Taft says, “whereas formerly an algorithm required six multiplies, four divides, and three square roots, now it only required three multiplies, four divides, and some approximation of a square root.” 
	“We came from the school of thought that software is soft. So if you have problems, you just have another release. But Apple was telling us, ‘Hey, we always ship our system in ROM, why can’t you?’” —Douglas Brotz
 Throughout the design of PostScript, speed was regularly traded off to ensure that any image would print. The group reasoned that if they built in all this functionality, they could eventually improve the performance; but if they left out functions, they might never be able to add them back in. However, says Putman, sometimes they had doubts. So they designed a version of PostScript that spat out information as fast as the laser moved across the page. The expense of the frame buffer was eliminated—along with the ability to print pages too complicated for the software to process in time. Adobe called this implementation Subscript, but dropped it after six months. As Taft says, “If you’re trying to promote a standard, there is nothing worse than issuing a subset of the standard. It means that all of the applications are going to be targeted to the lowest common denominator.” Debugging throughout the project was strenuous because the Adobe team was “terrified of putting all this code out on ROMs,” Brotz says. “We came from the school of thought that software is soft. So if you have problems, you just have another release. But Apple was telling us, ‘Hey, we always ship our system in ROM, why can’t you?’” In January of 1985 the Apple LaserWriter was introduced, virtually bug-free. In 1984, Adobe signed licensing agreements with QMS Inc., Linotype, and Dataproducts Corp. Today, even Hewlett-Packard Co., whose PCL page description language was one of PostScript’s earliest competitors, is among the 23 companies offering PostScript interpreters for their printers. Although the Adobe group made some key technical breakthroughs, three other components were necessary to make PostScript a runaway success not just in low-volume professional publishing but in the high-volume office environment. As noted earlier, one was a cheap laser printer. When Adobe was founded, the cheapest cost around $10,000. It also weighed as much as a desk, so that it had to be serviced on site and sold through a distributor, not on a cash-and-carry basis. Then Canon Inc., of Tokyo, Japan, introduced the Canon LBP-CX desktop laser printer, which, moreover, printed beautifully. “If it had been poor xerography,” says Paxton, “it wouldn’t have mattered how good our technology was.” Also on the horizon was a bit-map-based personal computer—the Apple Macintosh. All previous low-cost personal computers had used character graphics, for which daisy-wheel printers made more sense. “The projections were that the RAM prices were going to drop, but you had to have a very strong stomach to be able to go up to the wall and pray that the door was going to open.”—William Paxton The third piece of luck was the decline in the price of memory chips. “We started this development on an uneconomic basis,” Warnock says. “The LaserWriter’s first controller needed forty-eight 256K DRAM chips, which up to December of 1984 cost about $30 each. That meant Apple would have had to sell that machine for about $10,000—but its computer cost $2400.” But, with Belleville’s and Jobs’s strong support, the Adobe team bet that the memory process would drop. “Sure,” says Paxton, “the projections were that the RAM prices were going to drop, but you had to have a very strong stomach to be able to go up to the wall and pray that the door was going to open.” Warnock comments, “Most companies will only deal with present-day technology and known costs. The brilliance of Steve Jobs is that he will say, ‘There will be this chip coming out at that price point at that time, and I will design my product to use it.’” And indeed, when the LaserWriter was announced in January of 1985, 256K RAMs cost about $4 each and the printer could be priced at $6995. Today, some 40 companies have announced their equipment is compatible with PostScript and that their interpreters run faster and cost less than Adobe’s version. They cannot offer the same font library, but they say they have fonts and font algorithms as good as Adobe’s. At this writing, however, none of these companies had apparently shipped a PostScript clone to a customer, and they reportedly have found it harder to replicate Adobe’s work than they had anticipated. When they do finally ship, and if they can interpret 80 or 90 percent of PostScript programs, Adobe is resigned to facing “good old-fashioned American competition,” says Geschke. The company has no patents to defend, only copyrights and trade secrets, so if other companies can reproduce Adobe’s technology, it has no legal recourse. “The most we can do is to continue to improve our technology,” Geschke says. 
	Adobe’s latest technical breakthrough, demonstrated in San Francisco in January, is a version of PostScript that controls images on a computer screen as well as on a printed page. Called Display PostScript, this product is the first to provide device-independent graphics for computer screens.
 
	Display PostScript, like the original PostScript printer protocol, had a nudge from Jobs. His new company, NeXT Inc., Palo Alto, Calif., worked with Adobe to develop it, and it will be the graphics standard for all NeXT’s computers. Digital Equipment has already licensed Display PostScript for its DEC Windows workstation architecture. If other major companies follow, Adobe could be well on the way to setting its second standard.
	 Everything a programmer or user might want to know about the PostScript language is provided in “PostScript Language Tutorial and Cookbook“ and “PostScript Language Reference Manual,” both written by Adobe Systems Inc. and published by Addison Wesley Publishing Co. (New York, 1985). In addition, Adobe periodically publishes a newsletter, “Colophon,” with programming tips and news about PostScript products. Interpress, the page description language from Xerox Corp.’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) that preceded PostScript in the laboratory but followed it in the marketplace, is described in the June 1986 issue of IEEE’s magazine, Computer (pp. 72-77). For more information on Xerox PARC, see “Inside the PARC: the ‘information architects,’” Spectrum, October 1985, p. 62. “Window on PostScript” in MacWeek, Feb. 2, 1988, pp. 28-29, contains a discussion of competitors’ attempts to clone the language. Update April 2022: While most home and office printers rely on other page description languages these days, PostScript remains the choice of graphics artists and commercial printers for its ability to accurately produce complex images.

 In 1997, Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen created a sensation among venture capitalists and entrepreneurs with his book The Innovator's Dilemma. The lesson that most people remember from it is that a well-run business can’t afford to switch to a new approach—one that ultimately will replace its current business model—until it is too late. One of the most famous examples of this conundrum involved photography. The large, very profitable companies that made film for cameras knew in the mid-1990s that digital photography would be the future, but there was never really a good time for them to make the switch. At almost any point they would have lost money. So what happened, of course, was that they were displaced by new companies making digital cameras. (Yes, Fujifilm did survive, but the transition was not pretty, and it involved an improbable series of events, machinations, and radical changes.)            ","Adobe’s founders and engineers tell a tale of software, stumbles, and serendipity Time and again, in his earliest attempts at controlling laser printers, John Warnock got the message, “Page Too Complex,” from a recalcitrant machine. Any system he designed, he vowed, would have to have a “Print Anything” architecture. That goal led ultimately to a page description language called PostScript, today the de facto standard of desktop publishing. This article was first published as ""‘PostScript’ prints anything: a case history."" It appeared in the May 1988 issue of IEEE Spectrum. A PDF version is available on IEEE Xplore. The diagrams and photographs appeared in the original print version. Back then, Warnock already had a rough idea how to “Print Anything.” But later he ran into a different obstacle, when his employer, Xerox Corp., proved loath to support a truly standard language. So off he went, with Charles Geschke and several other colleagues, to found Adobe Systems Inc. in Mountain View, Calif. By that time, PostScript was only two major pieces of research away, although one—the development of type font algorithms—was “a research project that had to succeed,” says Warnock, and the other had been described as one of the world’s most difficult problems. The rest is desktop publishing history. PostScript can truly do anything, though extremely complex images can take as much as an hour of computation time. It first appeared in the Apple LaserWriter, which was introduced in January of 1985. Today it has been adopted by 23 manufacturers of laser printers, with more still signing on. This story is as much about luck and guts as about matters of principle and brilliant software engineering. Still, this story is as much about luck and guts as about matters of principle and brilliant software engineering. It would have been quite different had Warnock and company not been in the right place at the right time to meet the right person. The time was right because of the imminence of three hardware developments: the first low-cost, bit-mapped personal computer, the first low-cost laser printer, and a decline in price of high-density memory chips. And the right person was Apple founder Steven Jobs, who invented the first, hoped for the second, and told Adobe to tough out the third. Device-independent software Software not directly tied to a specific piece of hardware. Interpreter A program that translates an instruction in the source code of a high-level language into machine language by deciding on the fly what machine instructions best translate it before moving onto the next instruction in source code. Laser printer A device that, like a xerographic copier, draws an image on a drum, but with a laser beam instead of lenses; applies toner to the charged image area; and transfers the toner to a sheet of paper, melting it into the paper to set the image. Page description language A method of expressing the appearance of a printed image, including text, lines, and bit-mapped photographs. Postfix notation Also known as reverse Polish notation, the appearance of operators after the data on which they are to operate; thus 2 + 2 becomes 2 2 +. Today laser printers are rapidly replacing the daisy-wheel printers in the office, pushing out letter-quality type as their laser obeys the commands of simple software. But given more sophisticated software like PostScript, laser printers can do far more. They can print many different type fonts and make the letters dance around the page hand in hand with drawings and photographs. PostScript does all this implies—draws lines and curves, tilts text at arbitrary angles, or shades a photograph in various tones of gray. It is as complete and flexible a programming language as Pascal or C or Forth, having variables, loops, conditionals, operators, and routines and offering any number of ways to get the same output. The PostScript program is created on the computer either by someone using the language or by desktop publishing software or other applications software that translates, say, the movements of a mouse into a PostScript program. (Other page description languages are optimized for one of these purposes, not both.) That program is sent over a local-area network or through an RS-232 port to the laser printer. There it is converted into instructions for the printer by the PostScript interpreter, software resident in ROM. On the same circuit board as up to 2 megabytes of ROM is a Motorola 68000 series processor, which executes the instructions and causes the pages to be printed. Things were more elementary with the first laser printers, which were in regular use at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in the mid-1970s. They were controlled by a printing protocol called Press, which was not a programming language but a set of instructions that sent image data to a printer in a steady stream. It handled letters and simple images well, but for anything more detailed, got the printer to return the message: “Page Too Complex.” Thereupon the typical PARC engineer would simplify the image. But when Warnock, a computer scientist with a Ph.D. from the University of Utah, joined the center in 1978, he immediately began work on a new printer protocol. Six years of experience at Evans & Sutherland in Mountain View, Calif., had taught him where to start. Adobe Systems founders John Warnock (right) and Charles Geschke visited Adobe Creek, inspiration for their company’s name. A dry winter has slowed the creek to a trickle, but the company has had anything but a dry year. The entrepreneurs in 1982 found Adobe a suitable name since the creek meandered near both their domes and, even more important, had none of the Qs, Xs, Ys, and Zs then popular with high-tech startups. The PostScript program is created on the computer either by someone using the language or by desktop publishing software or other applications software that translates, say, the movements of a mouse into a PostScript program.

But when Warnock, a computer scientist with a Ph.D. from the University of Utah, joined the center in 1978, he immediately began work on a new printer protocol. Six years of experience at Evans & Sutherland in Mountain View, Calif., had taught him where to start. In 1971, Evans & Sutherland had undertaken to equip the New York Maritime Academy with a simulator for training harbor pilots. The trainees were to sit on the mockup of a ship’s bridge, surrounded by five 12-foot-high, 30-ft-long (3.6-by-9 meter) screens displaying a computer-generated representation of New York Harbor, complete with buildings, piers, movable buoys, changing weather conditions, and other ships to be avoided. The system had to produce images in full color for five projectors at 30 frames a second. Evans & Sutherland had never produced anything as complex. It let time slip by until, with only one of the contract’s three years left, “everybody hit the panic button,” Warnock says. So to save time, the company had the hardware and software developed in parallel, the first in Utah and the second by a team led by Warnock in California. The rush planted the first two seeds for what was to become PostScript. Obviously, a database listing everything in the harbor was both essential and would have to be built in total ignorance as to the hardware it would eventually run on. So Warnock’s team decided to invent a language unrelated to any computer. Only when the simulator hardware was ready would they build a compiler to translate the database into the appropriate machine language. Meanwhile, feeding information about the harbor into the database proved arduous. Putting maps on a digitizing tablet and touching them with a stylus at numerous points was not so bad; but using a keyboard to enter the details—whether the point touched was a pier of a certain type or a building or an island—was slow going. To make this task easier, John Gaffney, one of Warnock’s group, spent a weekend writing a software routine that would generate the information about the objects from menus. Because the PostScript Language treats text like any other graphic object, it can be scaled to any size and rotate to any angle. PostScript was the first page description language to be able to produce such a spiral of type. Adobe Systems Inc. By the time the harbor simulator was completed, only slightly behind schedule, Warnock had discovered how powerful an object-oriented language is. Unlike Basic or Fortran, say, which require the user to spell out every last instruction, it packs all those details into modules, or objects, which the user controls with just a few directives. Warnock had also discovered that making software device-independent “gives you a great deal of leverage and flexibility.” Those lessons learned, his group turned to expanding Gaffney’s little interpreter into a full programming system for computer-aided design (CAD). In 1977, that project was released by Evans & Sutherland as The Design System. “It had an interactive, stack-oriented architecture,” Gaffney said, “with simple commands for pushing and popping arguments onto and from the stack and a rich dictionary for look-ups.” (Such an architecture stores data as it is received, stacking it like a pile of books. A command like “add” would “pop” the topmost pieces of data from the stack, act on them, and “push” the result back on the pile.) Only one copy of The Design System was ever released, as a test bed for the final development, but the other company’s project director died and The Design System died with him. Warnock, however, took the stack and dictionary ideas—along with what he had learned from the harbor project—to PARC. PARC was then using a programming language called Mesa. In 1978, soon after arriving at the center, Warnock persuaded another Xerox researcher, Martin Newell, to help him re-create The Design System in Mesa. The result, called Jam, for John and Martin, proved the concepts he brought from Evans & Sutherland were appropriate for laser printing. Jam was object oriented and device independent, like the harbor simulator, and in some ways simpler than The Design System, because printing requires only two dimensions, versus CAD’s three. But it needed a few features, such as type fonts, found in neither of its ancestors. Moreover, Warnock recalls, “Xerox was using a different printing scheme on every printer. The Star workstations [then being developed] were crumbling under the load of trying to drive them all differently.” So Warnock and a group of researchers headed by Charles Geschke set out to merge Jam with the older Press protocol into Interpress, a standard, device-independent language capable of driving all Xerox Corp.’s laser printers. Interpress was completed in 1981, but unhappily, the end was not in sight. Because of the compromise between Jam and Press, “the language became complicated in its redesign,” Warnock says. And Xerox begged the issue of standardization by producing several versions of the language, so the company’s older laser printers could run some form of it. The commands of the PostScript programming language are optimized for graphics. This elongated word “Spectrum” was generated by the PostScript program shown below it. The first group of commands (red) identify a typeface from PostScript’s library of typefaces and enlarge it to 50 points from the 1-point size in which it is stored (in typesetting, there are 72 points to the inch). The next group of commands (blue) tells the laser printer at which point on the page to anchor the lower left corner of the word. The next command (yellow) stretches the typeface vertically, while leaving it unaltered horizontally. The final commands (purple) specify the letters to be drawn and order the printer to produce the image. A special program editor transmits the instructions to the printer. Adobe Systems Inc. Worst of all, to Warnock, was the insistence that printers always run at their rated speeds. Since a 20-page-per-minute printer could not produce anything very complex in three seconds, he was back facing his “Page Too Complex” nemesis. The constraint derived from the copier business, Geschke explains, where “pricing of leased machines was based on copies per day. But in electronic printing, in our opinion, function was most important, so there was a real variance between our and the Xerox position.” All the same, in the belief that any standard was better than none, Warnock and Geschke began promoting Interpress within Xerox Corp. Eventually, they won—sort of. But Xerox added, Warnock recalls, “’We’re going to keep it a secret because it is so wonderful and if we publish it the Japanese might implement it before we do.’ “Gee,’ I said, ‘A secret standard—I find this a hard concept to understand.’” Convinced that Xerox was making a mistake, Warnock and Geschke left PARC to implement their page description language once again, but this time within a corporation they controlled. With the help of David Evans of Evans & Sutherland and William Hambrecht of Hambrecht and Quist, a San Francisco-based venture capital firm, they wrote a business plan and incorporated in December of 1982. They intended both to sell this setup as a turnkey system and to franchise the publishing equivalent of a one-hour photo store. Desktop publishing, though, was not what Warnock and Geschke at first had in mind. The system they foresaw consisted of a workstation linked by a device-independent, page-description language like Jam to a laser printer for draft printing, a photo-typesetter for the final output, and whatever other output device they might later add. No other publishing package then available used the same software for different output devices. And they intended both to sell this setup as a turnkey system and to franchise the publishing equivalent of a one-hour photo store. Adobe then consisted of Warnock, Geschke, and a core of other engineers hired from PARC: Daniel Putman, Thomas Boynton, and Douglas Brotz. As they planned to buy whatever hardware they needed after they had perfected their programming language, they focused first on Jam. They worked in C, on a VAX 750 running Berkeley Unix, to develop the language, and they tested in on a Sun workstation driving a full-size laser printer that they had borrowed from Digital Equipment Corp. “At that time,” recalls Putman, “most companies required that we spell our names and pay in cash, so we had to beg, borrow, and steal the tools to prototype PostScript.” To avoid copyright problems, they licensed The Design System concepts from Evans & Sutherland. They were free to use their PARC research results, as those had been published. For years theoreticians have suggested means of breaking images into their line segments, but their algorithms tended to fall apart when faced with difficult cases—large numbers of lines intersecting at a single point, for example (inset). The Adobe team says it has solved this problem with a proprietary algorithm with the results illustrated here. The image was created with Adobe Illustrator, a drawing program that runs on the Apple Macintosh personal computer, and was printed on the ColorScript 100, the first color PostScript printer, released in April by QMS Inc. of Mobile, Ala. Warnock and Geschke were not close-mouthed about their plans, and soon not only Jobs heard (he was then chairman of Apple Computer Inc. of Cupertino, Calif.) but also C. Gordon Bell, then vice president of engineering at Digital Equipment in Maynard, Mass. Bell told the pair that six research teams at Digital had been trying for years to devise a decent means of driving its laser printers, and if Adobe could solve the problem, Digital would be interested in licensing the solution. Jobs had been facing a similar problem. The Macintosh was well into development, but without a letter-quality printer would go nowhere in the business market. Daisy-wheel printers were out of the question, because they could not produce the bit-mapped graphics basic to the Macintosh. But Apple’s own engineers could not get high-quality graphics out of a laser printer in time for the Macintosh introduction. Jobs suggested that Adobe become a software company, sell to manufacturers instead of at retail, and negotiate a licensing agreement with Apple. Undeterred, Jobs and Robert Belleville, then director of engineering for Apple and now director of strategic planning for Convergent Technologies Inc., San Jose, Calif., had dreamed up the perfect Macintosh laser printer—one that could produce all the fonts in the world with no help from a disk drive. But they lacked “the slightest idea of how to do this,” says Belleville, until he ran into Putman at a cocktail party, heard what Adobe was doing, and brought Jobs over for a visit. “I was overjoyed!” recalls Belleville. “Their system could do simple things fast and also do full graphics and scanned images. And when I saw font scaling was possible across such wide ranges, we were sold.” Jobs suggested that Adobe become a software company, sell to manufacturers instead of at retail, and negotiate a licensing agreement with Apple. Adobe liked the idea, signed the agreement with Apple at the end of 1983, and much to Hambrecht & Quist’s surprise, showed a profit at the end of its first year. Reimplementing the Jam language with its object orientation, stacks, postfix notation (in which operands precede their operators), and dictionary was relatively straightforward. Most of the research had been completed at Evans & Sutherland and at PARC. Basically all Adobe had to do was engineer it into a product, named PostScript after the postfix notation it uses and because it was to be the last thing that happened to an image before it was printed. Also, since the product had to “Print Anything,” it had to put functionality above speed and cost—the three factors traded off in the design of microprocessor systems like the one that would control the laser printer, explains Putman, now vice president of engineering at Adobe. Still, two key breakthroughs remained to be made. One of them was creating the font algorithms, proprietary formulas for the creation of text. “Even with Interpress,” says William Paxton, director of advanced development for Adobe, “fonts were a wart on the side of an otherwise elegant design.” Interpress could do arbitrary transformations, like scale and rotate, on images, but in its early versions could not do them on bit-mapped text without degrading its quality. PostScript, however, unifies text and graphics by storing the fonts as outline representations of the letters, not as bit maps. Back in early 1983, however, this unification was easier to propose than to realize. “Getting high-quality fonts from outline representations of characters was seen as an insoluble problem,” Warnock says, because it was hard to produce smooth curves of varying widths without jagged edges. Print quality seemed unobtainable from anything less than a phototypesetter. But in mid-1983, Warnock says, he had an idea for a fundamentally new set of algorithms that might do the trick. His initial experiments promised success, so he set Paxton to refining the algorithms. The results are proprietary and are encrypted inside the ROMs that contain PostScript instructions because this font technology is the key distinction between Adobe’s product and others. So successful was Adobe’s solution to the font problem that Linotype, Letraset, and other owners of the most popular typeface designs were willing for the first time to license the outline representations of their typefaces. No earlier technology had done them justice. (Ironically, Adobe is now licensing its font technology to Linotype, and Linotype is converting its entire library of some 2000 fonts into PostScript representations.) Adobe’s other technical breakthrough is the algorithm, called Reducer, that breaks down complex shapes into simpler ones easier for PostScript to describe. Such an algorithm is a key component of any graphics language, and theoretical papers about a universal form of it were numerous: but, says Brotz, “they tended to gloss over the hard cases that arise in real applications—figures with large amounts of data and multiple intersections at the same point, for example.” So when the page printed, certain images would come out badly fragmented or warped, violating Adobe’s “Print Anything” rule. “About a week after I had joined Adobe in 1983,” Brotz recalls, “John Warnock mentioned this rather important algorithm that had to be written. And I, with no graphics background, volunteered. Several months later, older and wiser, I realized it truly was one of the world’s hardest problems.” But Brotz did not give up, and he says, “We have now an exactly correct reducer algorithm. It is the heart of the graphics system in PostScript.” And a tally Brotz keeps reveals that no bugs have been discovered in the Reducer in more than two years. “Warnock promptly labeled [the procedure] ‘Andy’s Stupid Input Device'....[but] it turned out that Andy’s Stupid Input Device was the lowest common denominator and all the special-case code could disappear.” —Douglas Brotz Adobe had agreed to deliver its software for installation into the LaserWriter during the summer of 1984. But because of marketing and manufacturing concerns, the LaserWriter itself was to be introduced in January of 1985. So the Adobe engineers used the time to tighten the code (the final release contained some 200,000 bytes) and fine-tune the algorithms. They also made some more specific changes. One had to do with handling input devices. As originally conceived, PostScript was to have been independent of the output, but not the input, device. Warnock had thought that PostScript, to take in scanned images, would need to contain information about a wide range of optical scanners. But Brotz, after programming the parameters of just two of many scanner types, realized that the task was not only horrendous and repetitive but ate up a lot of memory. Andy Shore, an Adobe computer scientist, overheard him complaining one day and suggested writing a PostScript procedure that would pretend that it was an input device and spit out the image information in a standard format, regardless of the characteristics of the actual standard. Brotz did not think it would work and “Warnock promptly labeled it ‘Andy’s Stupid Input Device.'” Still, Brotz thought it might be helpful for generating test patterns, and when he implemented it, “it turned out that Andy’s Stupid Input Device was the lowest common denominator and all the special-case code could disappear.” Problems arise only when the image data has been compressed for transmission or storage; the programmer then has to insert a routine to decompress the data before it is handed to the image algorithm. Another improvement involved performance profiling—running various tests to see what frequently used functions slowed down operation. Floating-point routines were the chief culprits because they are computationally intensive. So the team took some of the algorithms for the common operations, such as breaking curves into vectors and drawing outlines, and rewrote them in less flexible fixed-point arithmetic. Now only when fixed-point arithmetic would be too imprecise does the interpreter call the floating-point routine. “So with no loss of generality,” says Edward Taft, Adobe senior computer scientist, “we were handling 99 percent of the cases five times faster than we were before.” To improve the other 1 percent, Belleville sent one of his engineers over from Apple—Jerome Coonen, a recognized expert in floating point. He optimized the algorithms so, Taft says, “whereas formerly an algorithm required six multiplies, four divides, and three square roots, now it only required three multiplies, four divides, and some approximation of a square root.” “We came from the school of thought that software is soft. So if you have problems, you just have another release. But Apple was telling us, ‘Hey, we always ship our system in ROM, why can’t you?’” —Douglas Brotz Throughout the design of PostScript, speed was regularly traded off to ensure that any image would print. The group reasoned that if they built in all this functionality, they could eventually improve the performance; but if they left out functions, they might never be able to add them back in. However, says Putman, sometimes they had doubts. So they designed a version of PostScript that spat out information as fast as the laser moved across the page. The expense of the frame buffer was eliminated—along with the ability to print pages too complicated for the software to process in time. Adobe called this implementation Subscript, but dropped it after six months. As Taft says, “If you’re trying to promote a standard, there is nothing worse than issuing a subset of the standard. It means that all of the applications are going to be targeted to the lowest common denominator.” Debugging throughout the project was strenuous because the Adobe team was “terrified of putting all this code out on ROMs,” Brotz says. “We came from the school of thought that software is soft. So if you have problems, you just have another release. But Apple was telling us, ‘Hey, we always ship our system in ROM, why can’t you?’” In January of 1985 the Apple LaserWriter was introduced, virtually bug-free. In 1984, Adobe signed licensing agreements with QMS Inc., Linotype, and Dataproducts Corp. Today, even Hewlett-Packard Co., whose PCL page description language was one of PostScript’s earliest competitors, is among the 23 companies offering PostScript interpreters for their printers. Although the Adobe group made some key technical breakthroughs, three other components were necessary to make PostScript a runaway success not just in low-volume professional publishing but in the high-volume office environment. As noted earlier, one was a cheap laser printer. When Adobe was founded, the cheapest cost around $10,000. It also weighed as much as a desk, so that it had to be serviced on site and sold through a distributor, not on a cash-and-carry basis. Then Canon Inc., of Tokyo, Japan, introduced the Canon LBP-CX desktop laser printer, which, moreover, printed beautifully. “If it had been poor xerography,” says Paxton, “it wouldn’t have mattered how good our technology was.” Also on the horizon was a bit-map-based personal computer—the Apple Macintosh. All previous low-cost personal computers had used character graphics, for which daisy-wheel printers made more sense. “The projections were that the RAM prices were going to drop, but you had to have a very strong stomach to be able to go up to the wall and pray that the door was going to open.”—William Paxton The third piece of luck was the decline in the price of memory chips. “We started this development on an uneconomic basis,” Warnock says. “The LaserWriter’s first controller needed forty-eight 256K DRAM chips, which up to December of 1984 cost about $30 each. That meant Apple would have had to sell that machine for about $10,000—but its computer cost $2400.” But, with Belleville’s and Jobs’s strong support, the Adobe team bet that the memory process would drop. “Sure,” says Paxton, “the projections were that the RAM prices were going to drop, but you had to have a very strong stomach to be able to go up to the wall and pray that the door was going to open.” Warnock comments, “Most companies will only deal with present-day technology and known costs. The brilliance of Steve Jobs is that he will say, ‘There will be this chip coming out at that price point at that time, and I will design my product to use it.’” And indeed, when the LaserWriter was announced in January of 1985, 256K RAMs cost about $4 each and the printer could be priced at $6995. Today, some 40 companies have announced their equipment is compatible with PostScript and that their interpreters run faster and cost less than Adobe’s version. They cannot offer the same font library, but they say they have fonts and font algorithms as good as Adobe’s. At this writing, however, none of these companies had apparently shipped a PostScript clone to a customer, and they reportedly have found it harder to replicate Adobe’s work than they had anticipated. When they do finally ship, and if they can interpret 80 or 90 percent of PostScript programs, Adobe is resigned to facing “good old-fashioned American competition,” says Geschke. The company has no patents to defend, only copyrights and trade secrets, so if other companies can reproduce Adobe’s technology, it has no legal recourse. “The most we can do is to continue to improve our technology,” Geschke says. Adobe’s latest technical breakthrough, demonstrated in San Francisco in January, is a version of PostScript that controls images on a computer screen as well as on a printed page. Called Display PostScript, this product is the first to provide device-independent graphics for computer screens. Display PostScript, like the original PostScript printer protocol, had a nudge from Jobs. His new company, NeXT Inc., Palo Alto, Calif., worked with Adobe to develop it, and it will be the graphics standard for all NeXT’s computers. Digital Equipment has already licensed Display PostScript for its DEC Windows workstation architecture. If other major companies follow, Adobe could be well on the way to setting its second standard. Everything a programmer or user might want to know about the PostScript language is provided in “PostScript Language Tutorial and Cookbook“ and “PostScript Language Reference Manual,” both written by Adobe Systems Inc. and published by Addison Wesley Publishing Co. (New York, 1985). In addition, Adobe periodically publishes a newsletter, “Colophon,” with programming tips and news about PostScript products. Interpress, the page description language from Xerox Corp.’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) that preceded PostScript in the laboratory but followed it in the marketplace, is described in the June 1986 issue of IEEE’s magazine, Computer (pp. 72-77). For more information on Xerox PARC, see “Inside the PARC: the ‘information architects,’” Spectrum, October 1985, p. 62. “Window on PostScript” in MacWeek, Feb. 2, 1988, pp. 28-29, contains a discussion of competitors’ attempts to clone the language. Update April 2022: While most home and office printers rely on other page description languages these days, PostScript remains the choice of graphics artists and commercial printers for its ability to accurately produce complex images.

He has been cofounder of iRobot, Rethink Robotics, and Robust AI, where he is currently CTO. In 1997, Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen created a sensation among venture capitalists and entrepreneurs with his book The Innovator's Dilemma. The lesson that most people remember from it is that a well-run business can’t afford to switch to a new approach—one that ultimately will replace its current business model—until it is too late. One of the most famous examples of this conundrum involved photography. The large, very profitable companies that made film for cameras knew in the mid-1990s that digital photography would be the future, but there was never really a good time for them to make the switch. At almost any point they would have lost money. So what happened, of course, was that they were displaced by new companies making digital cameras. (Yes, Fujifilm did survive, but the transition was not pretty, and it involved an improbable series of events, machinations, and radical changes.)","['founder', 'engineer', 'tell', 'tale', 'software',

        The Computers Who Brought ENIAC to Life
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/eniac-woman-programmers,2022-04-21,"Internet guru Kathy Kleiman is excavating the stories of early woman programmers Programmers at Aberdeen Proving Grounds configure ENIAC’s function tables, which acted as a form of read-only memory. The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer—better known as ENIAC—became the world’s first programmable general-purpose electronic computer when it was completed in 1945. ENIAC’s hardware was designed by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, but the programs it ran were largely the creation of a team of six women. For decades, these women were largely unknown, except only as unidentified figures in photographs of ENIAC. But as an undergraduate, Kathy Kleiman—who would later help found ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)—started looking into who they were. This weekend at the Vintage Computer Festival East in Wall, N.J., Kleiman will be screening her short documentary The Computers, about the programmers. In advance of her talk, IEEE Spectrum spoke to Kleiman about the ENIAC women and her fascination with them. How did these women come to be such a central part of the history of computing? Kathy Kleiman: During World War II, the army needed people to hand-calculate ballistics trajectories or artillery firing tables. And male mathematicians were running short. The Army relocated the project from rural Maryland to Philadelphia and went looking for women math majors in Philadelphia, which has a very high density of schools with coed universities and colleges and all-women schools.  Later they would go across the country looking for women math majors to come to the Morse School of Electrical Engineering, which is where they located this project and where they hand-calculated ballistic trajectories using mechanical desktop calculators. But it took 30 to 40 hours to calculate a single trajectory for one set of weather conditions for one gun and one projectile, and the Army needed hundreds of trajectories per firing table.  So in the dark days of the war, early 1943, when there was no end to the war in sight, they agreed to fund the experiment of a visionary guy who also happened to be at the Moore School at that time. His name was Dr. John Mauchly. He partnered with Presper Eckert, who was 23 years old at the time, a young engineering grad. They were yin and yang, a great combination. With Army funding, they built this machine that wasn’t supposed to work—18,000 vacuum tubes were never supposed to be able to work in concert. But they did it, a machine 8 feet tall and 80 feet long.  But when they’re almost done, they’re like, “Wait a second.” Part of the Army contract was delivering a working ballistic trajectory calculated by the machine. So a mathematician and Army lieutenant at the proving ground called Herman Goldstein picks six out of the 80 to 100 women who’ve been calculating trajectories. They [Kathleen Antonelli, Jean Bartik, Betty Holberton, Marlyn Meltzer, Frances Spence, and Ruth Teitelbaum] are given the wiring diagrams and the block diagrams and told to figure it out so they can do the ballistics trajectory equation.  The women don’t have security access to even see the actual computer, but they figure it out, doing what is now called direct programming. There’s looping, there’s conditional logic, and the women collectively mastered all this and made it perform the ballistic trajectory calculation that wound up becoming the climactic moment of demonstration day on 6 February 1946, when ENIAC was unveiled.  Why did you start looking into their story? Kleiman: I was at Harvard. I was kind of a social theory major. I took computer science from the first classes that I took in college because I was already a programmer because of a Western Electric program when I was in high school. I also noticed that as the levels of the computer science classes went higher, the number of women dropped. And I knew about Ada Lovelace. I knew about Grace Hopper. Ada Lovelace was in the 19th century, then Grace Hopper in the 20th century. And one woman succeeding in computing per century didn’t make me feel warm and fuzzy, so I went looking for more.  I found the pictures of ENIAC taken before demonstration day and given to the press and published across the country.  These pictures are beautiful black-and-white pictures, and they have men and women in them; some of them just have women! But while some of the men, particularly Eckert and Mauchly, are named in the captions, none of the names of the women are in the captions. I wanted to know who they were. I was told by some computer historians at the time that they were models, and they didn’t look like models to me. I tracked them down, and they weren’t models; they were programmers. You’ll be showing your documentary at VCF East, which features interviews with four of the programmers conducted before they passed away, but you’ll also be releasing a book later this year, called Proving Ground? Kleiman: The documentary raised as many questions as it answered. So I was kind of persuaded to tell the rest of the story, and really sit down and talk about the incredible work, not just of the ENIAC programmers but of millions of women on the home front during World War II. It turned out that is not a story we know very well. I had always known women went to the factories, they went to the farms. I didn’t realize until I sat down in front of newspapers of the period and saw the ads that there was an enormous push for women with science and technology backgrounds. If you had the interest, the aptitude, and some training, these articles made it clear they’d teach you the rest, not just for the military but for industry. That was just a whole part of the story I’d never heard, that women also filled in these gaps in science, technology, and engineering. Stephen Cass is the special projects editor at IEEE Spectrum.

","Internet guru Kathy Kleiman is excavating the stories of early woman programmers Programmers at Aberdeen Proving Grounds configure ENIAC’s function tables, which acted as a form of read-only memory. The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer—better known as ENIAC—became the world’s first programmable general-purpose electronic computer when it was completed in 1945. ENIAC’s hardware was designed by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, but the programs it ran were largely the creation of a team of six women. For decades, these women were largely unknown, except only as unidentified figures in photographs of ENIAC. But as an undergraduate, Kathy Kleiman—who would later help found ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)—started looking into who they were. This weekend at the Vintage Computer Festival East in Wall, N.J., Kleiman will be screening her short documentary The Computers, about the programmers. In advance of her talk, IEEE Spectrum spoke to Kleiman about the ENIAC women and her fascination with them. How did these women come to be such a central part of the history of computing? Kathy Kleiman: During World War II, the army needed people to hand-calculate ballistics trajectories or artillery firing tables. And male mathematicians were running short. The Army relocated the project from rural Maryland to Philadelphia and went looking for women math majors in Philadelphia, which has a very high density of schools with coed universities and colleges and all-women schools. Later they would go across the country looking for women math majors to come to the Morse School of Electrical Engineering, which is where they located this project and where they hand-calculated ballistic trajectories using mechanical desktop calculators. But it took 30 to 40 hours to calculate a single trajectory for one set of weather conditions for one gun and one projectile, and the Army needed hundreds of trajectories per firing table.

        Protecting Privacy in Surveillance Video While Mining It for Data
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/surveillance-privacy,2022-04-19,"A new technique may help defend privacy while permitting useful analysis of surveillance data Surveillance cameras have proliferated across the globe, raising concerns about privacy that have only deepened as machine-learning tools have now enabled automated video analysis on a massive scale. Now a new security system aims to defend privacy in a way that supports honest analysis of video footage while confounding malicious spying. There are now “hundreds of millions of surveillance cameras out there across the world,” notes Frank Cangialosi, a computer scientist at MIT and lead author on a study of the system. In the past, these cameras were occasionally monitored manually, if at all, and largely used for security purposes. But steady advances in artificial intelligence have now made it possible for computers to analyze this video data en masse. There are many applications for automated video analysis of surveillance footage, such as: helping health officials measure the proportion of people wearing masks; letting transportation departments monitor the density and flow of vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles to figure out where to add sidewalks and bike lanes; and giving businesses better insight into shopping behavior for better planning of promotions. However, such mass surveillance poses the risk of intrusions on privacy at unprecedented scales. “Video analytics is an exciting potential area, but I think our community also has this huge responsibility to think carefully about how it could be misused and put equal effort towards addressing that,” Cangialosi says. Attempts to defend privacy against such technology often involve blurring out faces or covering them with black boxes. Those methods can prevent useful analysis of this video, while still not having the intended effect of preserving anonymity.  “So, citizens aren’t going to feel protected, and analysts aren’t going to feel it’s useful enough for them,” Cangialosi says. “It doesn't satisfy anyone, which is why these approaches aren’t actually widely used in practice. And after thinking about it a bit, we realized that these are fundamental issues, so there’s this need for a totally different approach.” Now, Cangialosi and his colleagues have developed a new system called Privid that lets analysts examine video for statistical data without revealing personally identifiable information. “Privid might enable us to actually [make more productive use of] tons of footage from all of the cameras we already have around the world [and do so] in a safe way,” Cangialosi says. “They have tons of coverage and are very versatile, so I think there’s really a lot of potential.” Privid works by first accepting code from an analyst containing a query that triggers an automatic count of, say, the number of people wearing masks in a video feed and the density of the crowd. The system then breaks that video footage into segments and runs the code on each chunk. Instead of reporting the results back from each segment to the analyst, Privid aggregates the data and adds some noise to it before returning the results. The aim of Privid is to let analysts with honest queries get the details they want, while restricting access to raw surveillance data that would enable malicious actors to gain too much information. For example, when it comes to a video feed observing multiple city intersections, both an honest and a malicious query might claim to want to count the number of people that pass by each hour. Whereas the well-intentioned query from an urban-planning department might want to count pedestrian numbers to better plan crosswalks, the point of a query from someone with malicious intent might be to track a few specific people by looking out for their faces. Assuming Privid executes both the anodyne and malicious queries, the addition of a little noise does little to derail the analyst behind the honest query from obtaining the count of passersby as was claimed. That same noise, given how the malicious query was actually looking to identify a few specific people, would have a large, confounding effect on the attempt to misuse the data. Privid can also tell analysts how much error it adds to results, which honest analysts can account for in their research so that they can  still detect valuable patterns and trends. Cangialosi stresses that “we are not encouraging surveillance.” With the idea of surveillance, he admits, “lots of negative things, understandably, immediately come to mind—the idea of being watched, Big Brother, and so on. But this is exactly what we want to prevent, full stop. Our fundamental idea of privacy is this idea that we should only be able to use cameras for things that don’t identify people. And there’s lots of examples of this that can benefit society, such as urban safety, public health, and so on.” A common technical question Cangialosi gets is “Does the privacy guarantee we provide only apply to a single camera?” “The short answer is no. The exact implications are a bit detailed, but the high-level point is that no matter how many cameras’ image feeds are in the system, and no matter how many cameras an analyst aggregates across, an individual will still be protected and can’t be tracked across location and time.” The researchers note that adding noise to the results may defend privacy, but does also make the analyses imperfect. Still, they noted that across a variety of videos and queries, Privid returned the right answer to queries between 70 and 99 percent  of the time when its attention was trained on nonprivate systems. “Privid isn’t a panacea,” Cangialosi notes. “I think there are lots of use cases where privacy and utility aren’t really at odds, and so we can get a good balance of ensuring privacy without doing too much harm to accuracy or utility. Privid is great for these use cases.” On the other hand, he cautions, “there are some cases where privacy and utility really are fundamentally at odds. In security-critical applications, like locating a missing person or a stolen car, the entire point is to identify an individual,” Cangialosi says. In such cases, the solution may not be a technical one, “but rather good policies.” Cangialosi notes that while the scientists focused on the compromise between utility and privacy with Privid, they did not worry about computational efficiency. “An important next step is incorporating a lot of the optimizations the rest of the community has worked on towards making video analytics more efficient,” he says. “The challenge, of course, is doing it carefully, in such a way that we can still maintain the same formal privacy guarantees.” Future research can also explore different types of video feeds, such as dash cams and videoconference calls, as well as audio and other data. “These data sources represent even more untapped potential for analytics, but they’re obviously in some very privacy-sensitive scenarios,” Cangialosi says. “I think it'll be really exciting to expand the set of domains where we can have computers learn some important information that can help society, while also making sure [that data can’t be used to] harm anyone.” The scientists detailed their findings on 4 April at the USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation Conference in Renton, Wash.

And how Xerox lost it An undated exterior view of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) is shown in Palo Alto, California. In late 1969, C. Peter McColough, chairman of Xerox Corp., told the New York Society of Security Analysts that Xerox was determined to develop “the architecture of information” to solve the problems that had been created by the “knowledge explosion.” Legend has it that McColough then turned to Jack E. Goldman, senior vice president of research and development, and said, “All right, go start a lab that will find out what I just meant.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ","A new technique may help defend privacy while permitting useful analysis of surveillance data Surveillance cameras have proliferated across the globe, raising concerns about privacy that have only deepened as machine-learning tools have now enabled automated video analysis on a massive scale.

In such cases, the solution may not be a technical one, “but rather good policies.” Cangialosi notes that while the scientists focused on the compromise between utility and privacy with Privid, they did not worry about computational efficiency. “An important next step is incorporating a lot of the optimizations the rest of the community has worked on towards making video analytics more efficient,” he says. “The challenge, of course, is doing it carefully, in such a way that we can still maintain the same formal privacy guarantees.” Future research can also explore different types of video feeds, such as dash cams and videoconference calls, as well as audio and other data. “These data sources represent even more untapped potential for analytics, but they’re obviously in some very privacy-sensitive scenarios,” Cangialosi says. “I think it'll be really exciting to expand the set of domains where we can have computers learn some important information that can help society, while also making sure [that data can’t be used to] harm anyone.” The scientists detailed their findings on 4 April at the USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation Conference in Renton, Wash.

And how Xerox lost it An undated exterior view of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) is shown in Palo Alto, California. In late 1969, C. Peter McColough, chairman of Xerox Corp., told the New York Society of Security Analysts that Xerox was determined to develop “the architecture of information” to solve the problems that had been created by the “knowledge explosion.” Legend has it that McColough then turned to Jack E. Goldman, senior vice president of research and development, and said, “All right, go start a lab that will find out what I just meant.”","['new', 'technique', 'defend', 'privacy', 'permit', 'useful',
