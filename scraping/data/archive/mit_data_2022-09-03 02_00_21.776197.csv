What does GPT-3 “know” about me? ,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/31/1058800/what-does-gpt-3-know-about-me/,2022-08-31,"<p>Large language models are trained on troves of personal data hoovered from the internet. So I wanted to know: What does it have on me?</p>
","For a reporter who covers AI, one of the biggest stories this year has been the rise of large language models. These are AI models that produce text a human might have written—sometimes so convincingly they have tricked people into thinking they are sentient.  These models’ power comes from troves of publicly available human-created text that has been hoovered from the internet. It got me thinking: What data do these models have on me? And how could it be misused?  It’s not an idle question. I’ve been paranoid about posting anything about my personal life publicly since a bruising experience about a decade ago. My images and personal information were splashed across an online forum, then dissected and ridiculed by people who didn’t like a column I’d written for a Finnish newspaper.  Up to that point, like many people, I’d carelessly littered the internet with my data: personal blog posts, embarrassing photo albums from nights out, posts about my location, relationship status, and political preferences, out in the open for anyone to see. Even now, I’m still a relatively public figure, since I’m a journalist with essentially my entire professional portfolio just one online search away.  OpenAI has provided limited access to its famous large language model, GPT-3, and Meta lets people play around with its model OPT-175B though a publicly available chatbot called BlenderBot 3.  I decided to try out both models, starting by asking GPT-3: Who is Melissa Heikkilä?  When I read this, I froze. Heikkilä was the 18th most common surname in my native Finland in 2022, but I’m one of the only journalists writing in English with that name. It shouldn’t surprise me that the model associated it with journalism. Large language models scrape vast amounts of data from the internet, including news articles and social media posts, and names of journalists and authors appear very often.  And yet, it was jarring to be faced with something that was actually correct. What else does it know?? But it quickly became clear the model doesn’t really have anything on me. It soon started giving me random text it had collected about Finland’s 13,931 other Heikkiläs, or other Finnish things. Lol. Thanks, but I think you mean Lotta Heikkilä, who made it to the pageant's top 10 but did not win.  Turns out I’m a nobody. And that’s a good thing in the world of AI.  Large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI’s GPT-3, Google’s LaMDA, and Meta’s OPT-175B, are red hot in AI research, and they are becoming an increasingly integral part of the internet’s plumbing. LLMs are being used to power chatbots that help with customer service, to create more powerful online search, and to help software developers write code.  If you’ve posted anything even remotely personal in English on the internet, chances are your data might be part of some of the world’s most popular LLMs.  Tech companies such as Google and OpenAI do not release information about the data sets that have been used to build their language models, but they inevitably include some sensitive personal information, such as addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. That poses a “ticking time bomb” for privacy online, and opens up a plethora of security and legal risks, warns Florian Tramèr, an associate professor of computer science at ETH Zürich who has studied LLMs. Meanwhile, efforts to improve the privacy of machine learning and regulate the technology are still in their infancy.  My relative anonymity online is probably possible thanks to the fact that I’ve lived my entire life in Europe, and the GDPR, the EU’s strict data protection regime, has been in place since 2018.  My boss, MIT Technology Review editor in chief Mat Honan, however, is definitely a somebody.  Both GPT-3 and BlenderBot “knew” who he was. This is what GPT-3 had on him.  That’s unsurprising—Mat’s been very online for a very long time, meaning he has a bigger online footprint than I do. It might also be because he is based in the US, and most large language models are very US-focused. The US does not have a federal data protection law. California, where Mat lives, does have one, but it did not come into effect until 2020. Mat’s claim to fame, according to GPT-3 and BlenderBot, is his “epic hack” that he wrote about in an article for Wired back in 2012. As a result of security flaws in Apple and Amazon systems, hackers got hold of and deleted Mat’s entire digital life. [Editor’s note: He did not hack the accounts of Barack Obama and Bill Gates.] But it gets creepier. With a little prodding, GPT-3 told me Mat has a wife and two young daughters (correct, apart from the names), and lives in San Francisco (correct). It also told me it wasn’t sure if Mat has a dog: “[From] what we can see on social media, it doesn't appear that Mat Honan has any pets. He has tweeted about his love of dogs in the past, but he doesn't seem to have any of his own.” (Incorrect.) The system also offered me his work address, a phone number (not correct), a credit card number (also not correct), a random phone number with an area code in Cambridge, Massachusetts (where MIT Technology Review is based), and an address for a building next to the local Social Security Administration in San Francisco.  GPT-3’s database has collected information on Mat from several sources, according to an OpenAI spokesperson. Mat’s connection to San Francisco is in his Twitter profile and LinkedIn profile, which appear on the first page of Google results for his name. His new job at MIT Technology Review was widely publicized and tweeted. Mat’s hack went viral on social media, and he gave interviews to media outlets about it.  For other, more personal information, it is likely GPT-3 is “hallucinating.” “GPT-3 predicts the next series of words based on a text input the user provides. Occasionally, the model may generate information that is not factually accurate because it is attempting to produce plausible text based on statistical patterns in its training data and context provided by the user—this is commonly known as ‘hallucination,’” a spokesperson for OpenAI says.  I asked Mat what he made of it all. “Several of the answers GPT-3 generated weren’t quite right. (I never hacked Obama or Bill Gates!),” he said. “But most are pretty close, and some are spot on. It’s a little unnerving. But I’m reassured that the AI doesn’t know where I live, and so I’m not in any immediate danger of Skynet sending a Terminator to door-knock me. I guess we can save that for tomorrow.”   Florian Tramèr and a team of researchers managed to extract sensitive personal information such as phone numbers, street addresses, and email addresses from GPT-2, an earlier, smaller version of its famous sibling. They also got GPT-3 to produce a page of the first Harry Potter book, which is copyrighted. Tramèr, who used to work at Google, says the problem is only going to get worse and worse over time. “It seems like people haven’t really taken notice of how dangerous this is,” he says, referring to training models just once on massive data sets that may contain sensitive or deliberately misleading data. The decision to launch LLMs into the wild without thinking about privacy is reminiscent of what happened when Google launched its interactive map Google Street View in 2007, says Jennifer King, a privacy and data policy fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.  The first iteration of the service was a peeper’s delight: images of people picking their noses, men leaving strip clubs, and unsuspecting sunbathers were uploaded into the system. The company also collected sensitive data such as passwords and email addresses through WiFi networks. Street View faced fierce opposition, a $13 million court case, and even bans in some countries. Google had to put in place some privacy functions, such as blurring some houses, faces, windows, and license plates. “Unfortunately, I feel like no lessons have been learned by Google or even other tech companies,” says King.   LLMs that are trained on troves of personal data come with big risks.  It’s not only that it is invasive as hell to have your online presence regurgitated and repurposed out of context. There are also some serious security and safety concerns. Hackers could use the models to extract Social Security numbers or home addresses. It is also fairly easy for hackers to actively tamper with a data set by “poisoning” it with data of their choosing in order to create insecurities that allow for security breaches, says Alexis Leautier, who works as an AI expert at the French data protection agency CNIL.   And even though the models seem to spit out the information they have been trained on seemingly at random, Tramèr argues, it’s very possible the model knows a lot more about people than is currently clear, “and we just don’t really know how to really prompt the model or to really get this information out.”  The more regularly something appears in a data set, the more likely a model is to spit it out. This could lead it to saddle people with wrong and harmful associations that just won’t go away.  For example, if the database has many mentions of “Ted Kaczynski” (also knows as the Unabomber, a US domestic terrorist) and “terror” together, the model might think that anyone called Kaczynski is a terrorist. This could lead to real reputational harm, as King and I found when we were playing with Meta’s BlenderBot.  Maria Renske “Marietje” Schaake is not a terrorist but a prominent Dutch politician and former member of the European Parliament. Schaake is now the international policy director at Stanford University’s Cyber Policy Center and an international policy fellow at Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.  Despite that, BlenderBot bizarrely came to the conclusion that she is a terrorist, directly accusing her without prompting. How?  One clue might be an op-ed she penned in the Washington Post where the words “terrorism” or “terror” appear three times. Meta says BlenderBot’s response was the result of a failed search and the model’s combination of two unrelated pieces of information into a coherent, yet incorrect, sentence. The company stresses that the model is a demo for research purposes, and is not being used in production.   “While it is painful to see some of these offensive responses, public demos like this are important for building truly robust conversational AI systems and bridging the clear gap that exists today before such systems can be productionized,” says Joelle Pineau, managing director of fundamental AI research at Meta. But it’s a tough issue to fix, because these labels are incredibly sticky. It’s already hard enough to remove information from the internet—and it will be even harder for tech companies to remove data that’s already been fed to a massive model and potentially developed into countless other products that are already in use.  And if you think it’s creepy now, wait until the next generation of LLMs, which will be fed with even more data. “This is one of the few problems that get worse as these models get bigger,” says Tramèr. It’s not just personal data. The data sets are likely to include data that is copyrighted, such as source code and books, Tramèr says. Some models have been trained on data from GitHub, a website where software developers keep track of their work.  A group of over 1,000 AI researchers has created a multilingual large language model bigger than GPT-3—and they’re giving it out for free. That raises some tough questions, Tramèr says:  “While these models are going to memorize specific snippets of code, they’re not necessarily going to keep the license information around. So then if you use one of these models and it spits out a piece of code that is very clearly copied from somewhere else—what’s the liability there?”  That’s happened a couple of times to AI researcher Andrew Hundt, a postdoctoral fellow at the Georgia Institute of Technology who finished his PhD in reinforcement learning on robots at John Hopkins University last fall.  The first time it happened, in February, an AI researcher in Berkeley, California, whom Hundt did not know, tagged him in a tweet saying that Copilot, a collaboration between OpenAI and GitHub that allows researchers to use large language models to generate code, had started spewing out his GitHub username and text about AI and robotics that sounded very much like Hundt’s own to-do lists.  “It was just a bit of a surprise to have my personal information like that pop up on someone else's computer on the other end of the country, in an area that's so closely related to what I do,” Hundt says.  That could pose problems down the line, Hundt says. Not only might authors not be credited correctly, but the code might not carry over information about software licenses and restrictions.  Neglecting privacy could mean tech companies end up in trouble with increasingly hawkish tech regulators. “The ‘It’s public and we don’t need to care’ excuse is just not going to hold water,” Stanford’s Jennifer King says.  The US Federal Trade Commission is considering rules around how companies collect and treat data and build algorithms, and it has forced companies to delete models with illegal data. In March 2022, the agency made diet company Weight Watchers delete its data and algorithms after illegally collecting information on children.  “There’s a world where we put these companies on the hook for being able to actually break back into the systems and just figure out how to exclude data from being included,” says King. “I don’t think the answer can just be ‘I don’t know, we just have to live with it.’” Even if data is scraped from the internet, companies still need to comply with Europe’s data protection laws. “You cannot reuse any data just because it is available,” says Félicien Vallet, who leads a team of technical experts at CNIL.  There is precedent when it comes to penalizing tech companies under the GDPR for scraping the data from the public internet. Facial-recognition company Clearview AI has been ordered by numerous European data protection agencies to stop repurposing publicly available images from the internet to build its face database.  “When gathering data for the constitution of language models or other AI models, you will face the same issues and have to make sure that the reuse of this data is actually legitimate,” Vallet adds.  There are some efforts to make the field of machine learning more privacy-minded. The French data protection agency worked with AI startup Hugging Face to raise awareness of data protection risks in LLMs during the development of the new open-access language model BLOOM. Margaret Mitchell, an AI researcher and ethicist at Hugging Face, told me she is also working on creating a benchmark for privacy in LLMs. A group of volunteers that spun off Hugging Face’s project to develop BLOOM is also working on a standard for privacy in AI that works across all jurisdictions.  “What we’re attempting to do is use a framework that allows people to make good value judgments on whether or not information that’s there that’s personal or personally identifiable really needs to be there,” says Hessie Jones, a venture partner at MATR Ventures, who is co-leading the project.  MIT Technology Review asked Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Deepmind—which have all developed state-of-the-art LLMs—about their approach to LLMs and privacy. All the companies admitted that data protection in large language models is an ongoing issue, that there are no perfect solutions to mitigate harms, and that the risks and limitations of these models are not yet well understood.  Developers have some tools, though, albeit imperfect ones.  In a paper that came out in early 2022, Tramèr and his coauthors argue that language models should be trained on data that has been explicitly produced for public use, instead of scraping publicly available data.  Private data is often scattered throughout the data sets used to train LLMs, many of which are scraped off the open internet. The more often those personal bits of information appear in the training data, the more likely the model is to memorize them, and the stronger the association becomes. One way companies such as Google and OpenAI say they try to mitigate this problem is to remove information that appears multiple times in data sets before training their models on them. But that’s hard when your data set consists of gigabytes or terabytes of data and you have to differentiate between text that contains no personal data, such as the US Declaration of Independence, and someone’s private home address.  Google uses human raters to rate personally identifiable information as unsafe, which helps train the company’s LLM LaMDA to avoid regurgitating it, says Tulsee Doshi, head of product for responsible AI at Google.  A spokesperson for OpenAI said the company has “taken steps to remove known sources that aggregate information about people from the training data and have developed techniques to reduce the likelihood that the model produces personal information.”  Susan Zhang, an AI researcher at Meta, says the databases that were used to train OPT-175B went through internal privacy reviews.   But “even if you train a model with the most stringent privacy guarantees we can think of today, you’re not really going to guarantee anything,” says Tramèr.   ","For a reporter who covers AI, one of the biggest stories this year has been the rise of large language models.

It’s edited by Michael Reilly and mixed by Garret Lang with original music by Jacob Gorski. The art is from Eric Mongeon and Stephanie Arnett.  [PREROLL] [TR ID] Jennifer Strong: The genetic sequence of the COVID-19 virus was first published in January 2020. It kicked off an international sprint to develop a vaccine... and represented an unprecedented collaboration between the pharmaceutical industry and governments around the world.  And it worked. Months later, the U.S Government approved emergency authorizations for multiple vaccines.  I’m Jennifer Strong, and this is I Was There When—an oral history project featuring the stories of breakthroughs and watershed moments in AI and computing… as told by those who witnessed them. This episode, we meet Dave Johnson, the chief data and artificial intelligence officer at Moderna. [PREROLL] [TR ID] Dave Johnson: Moderna is a biotech company that was founded on the promise of mRNA technology. My name is Dave Johnson. I'm chief data and AI officer at Moderna. mRNA is essentially an information molecule. It's encoded, a sequence of amino acids, which when they enter the cell in your body, it produces a protein and that protein can perform a variety of different functions in your body from curing a rare disease, potentially attacking cancer, or even a vaccine to battle of virus like we've seen with Covid. What's so fundamentally different about this approach from the typical pharmaceutical development is it's much more of a design approach. We're saying we know what we want to do. And then we're trying to design the right information molecule, the right protein, that will then have that effect in the body. And if you know anything about pharmaceutical development, it tends to be a very serial process. You know, you start with some kind of initial concept, some initial idea and you test it in Petri dishes or in, you know, small experiments. And then you move on to preclinical testing. And if all of that looks good, then you're finally moving off to, to human testing and you go through several different phases of clinical trials where phase three is the, the largest one where you're proving the efficacy of this drug. And that whole process from end to end can be immensely expensive, cost billions of dollars and take, you know, up to a decade to do that. And in many cases, it still fails. You know, there's countless diseases out there right now that have no vaccine for them, that have no treatment for them. And it's not like people haven't tried, it's just, they're, they're challenging. And so we built the company thinking about: how can we reduce those timelines? How can we target many, many more things? And so that's how I kind of entered into the company. You know, my background is in software engineering and data science. I actually have a PhD in what's called information physics—which is very closely related to data science. And I started when the company was really young, maybe a hundred, 200 people at the time. And we were building that early preclinical engine of a company, which is, how can we target a bunch of different ideas at once, run some experiments, learn really fast and do it again. Let's run a hundred experiments at once and let's learn quickly and then take that learning into the next stage. So if you wanna run a lot of experiments, you have to have a lot of mRNA. So we built out this massively parallel robotic processing of mRNA, and we needed to integrate all of that. We needed systems to kind of drive all of those, uh, robotics together. And, you know, as things evolved as you capture data in these systems, that's where AI starts to show up. You know, instead of just capturing, you know, here's what happened in an experiment, now you're saying let's use that data to make some predictions.  Let's take out decision making away from, you know, scientists who don't wanna just stare and look at data over and over and over again. But let's use their insights. Let's build models and algorithms to automate their analyses and, you know, do a much better job and much faster job of predicting outcomes and improving the quality of our, our data. So when Covid showed up, it was really, uh, a powerful moment for us to take everything we had built and everything we had learned, and the research we had done and really apply it in this really important scenario. Um, and so when this sequence was first released by Chinese authorities, it was only 42 days for us to go from taking that sequence, identifying, you know, these are the mutations we wanna do. This is the protein we want to target.  Forty-two days from that point to actually building up clinical-grade, human safe manufacturing, batch, and shipping it off to the clinic—which is totally unprecedented. I think a lot of people were surprised by how fast it moved, but it's really… We spent 10 years getting to this point. We spent 10 years building this engine that lets us move research as quickly as possible. But it didn't stop there. We thought, how can we use data science and AI to really inform the, the best way to get the best outcome of our clinical studies. And so one of the first big challenges we had was we have to do this large phase three trial to prove in a large number, you know, it was 30,000 subjects in this study to prove that this works, right? That's a huge study. Covid had been flaring, um, infecting countless people. And we had to figure out: where do we run our studies? We're gonna pick a hundred locations in the US to run this study and we needed to balance finding places where we have kind of the right racial diversity that's the right makeup for the country. We needed to balance… kind of practical concerns. If we need a, you know, the right size facility and clinical trial sites that can deliver quality data. And we need to find places where Covid has not already hit. So at the time New York, for example, was already heavily hit. And so it wouldn't be an ideal place to run a clinical study because we have to accrue cases of it. So we had to find places that weren't quite yet hit, but places that we expected to actually, you know, surge, you know, maybe six weeks after the study started after people had been inoculated. So that's a really challenging problem we had to solve. And I wanna say, you know, we, we didn't do this all entirely internally. We worked with countless external partners. And I can't tell you the number of different epidemiology models that we saw. It seemed like everybody was an epidemiologist all of a sudden. But we incorporated all that learning all that information into our internal decision making and used that to try to find: these are the optimal places that we should run this study. And then even while we were running this study, we were saying, how can we continue to optimize and do better? You know, we built real time analytics into our studies enrollment. So as patients or subjects enrolled into the study, were treated with our vaccine, we are monitoring the diversity of this: the age, the gender, and racial diversity to ensure that the final makeup of this study, when all said and done was representative of the US. We got, I wanna say, maybe 80% of the way through the study. And we realized, look, we are not gonna meet our, our objectives because the level of volunteers aren't quite what we wanted. And so we made the, the really difficult decision to say, look, we need a throttle, some areas of the country and focus on outreach in different areas to get the right makeup so that the study was representative. All told, it was about a year from when we, you know, started this journey on Covid to when we got the emergency use authorization for the vaccine—which again is really unprecedented for something that usually takes many years. And I'll say for myself personally, it was just such an amazing kind of emotional moment of, you know, I joined the company almost eight years earlier, not thinking necessarily I would ever use one of our own medicines because we weren't even doing vaccines at the time. But to have that injected in my arm and for my family to get it for my friends and everyone else to, to see that benefit and for so many other people in the world, was just an amazing moment for us.

And so it wouldn't be an ideal place to run a clinical study because we have to accrue cases of it. So we had to find places that weren't quite yet hit, but places that we expected to actually, you know, surge, you know, maybe six weeks after the study started after people had been inoculated. So that's a really challenging problem we had to solve. And I wanna say, you know, we, we didn't do this all entirely internally. We worked with countless external partners. And I can't tell you the number of different epidemiology models that we saw. It seemed like everybody was an epidemiologist all of a sudden. But we incorporated all that learning all that information into our internal decision making and used that to try to find: these are the optimal places that we should run this study. And then even while we were running this study, we were saying, how can we continue to optimize and do better? You know, we built real time analytics into our studies enrollment. So as patients or subjects enrolled into the study, were treated with our vaccine, we are monitoring the diversity of this: the age, the gender, and racial diversity to ensure that the final makeup of this study, when all said and done was representative of the US. We got, I wanna say, maybe 80% of the way through the study. And we realized, look, we are not gonna meet our, our objectives because the level of volunteers aren't quite what we wanted. And so we made the, the really difficult decision to say, look, we need a throttle, some areas of the country and focus on outreach in different areas to get the right makeup so that the study was representative. All told, it was about a year from when we, you know, started this journey on Covid to when we got the emergency use authorization for the vaccine—which again is really unprecedented for something that usually takes many years. And I'll say for myself personally, it was just such an amazing kind of emotional moment of, you know, I joined the company almost eight years earlier, not thinking necessarily I would ever use one of our own medicines because we weren't even doing vaccines at the time. But to have that injected in my arm and for my family to get it for my friends and everyone else to, to see that benefit and for so many other people in the world, was just an amazing moment for us.

The outgoing White House AI director explains the policy challenges ahead,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/23/1058412/white-house-ai-director-challenges/,2022-08-23,"<p>Algorithmic bias, a small AI workforce, and a lack of AI education may hold the US back from leading the world in the technology, says Lynne Parker.</p>
","The first director of the White House’s National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office, Lynne Parker, has just stepped down. The NAIIO launched in January 2021 to coordinate the different federal agencies that work on artificial-intelligence initiatives, with the goal of advancing US development of AI.  Its goals are to ensure that the US is a leader in AI research and development, particularly in the development and use of trustworthy AI, and to prepare the US workforce with better education and training.  As its first director, Parker oversaw the creation of a national AI R&D strategic plan, a national AI research institute, and an AI portal to help researchers apply for funding. and conducted research in ways to measure and evaluate AI.  She is now returning to her role in academia as the director of AI initiatives at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. We spoke to her about the office’s accomplishments and the major challenges ahead for AI in the US. The conversation has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. What has been the NAIIO’s biggest accomplishment so far? The National AI Initiative covers so much territory: R&D, governance aspects of the use of AI, education and workforce training, international collaboration, and the use of AI within the federal government. That’s a lot of activities. The NAIIO has helped to better structure that, and it's been able to put in place a number of communication channels, and ways to prioritize and coordinate what we’re doing in all of those areas, so that we can make efficient and effective progress. What’s the most important challenge it needs to tackle in the future? In the R&D space, I think the challenge will be to make sure that we’re continuing to invest in high-quality, long-term research that has impactful outcomes, so that we can build up the next generation of AI that will give us benefit down the road. For the development and use of trustworthy AI, the challenge is how we actually implement many of the fundamental principles. For education and workforce—AI, in some sense, is becoming the new math. But not everyone needs advanced calculus, for instance; many just need to know algebra. And so it’s the same in the AI space. Many need to know the basic concepts and capabilities of AI at just a conceptual level, and others need to be able to be experts and program and develop new machine-learning algorithms. Coming up with education and training opportunities for different people through all walks of life and in all types of jobs is a challenge. Which aspects of the NAIIO’s remit have been easier to make progress on? Which have been harder? Part of this may reflect my own background, but I think R&D has been easier because it’s more structured … At the end of the day, funding is often what it boils down to in R&D, and I think we have done a very good job of prioritizing and funding AI R&D.  In terms of a pillar that’s more challenging, I’ll come back to education and the workforce, because there’s so many different kinds of needs. And because K-12 education is managed by the states—it’s not a single approach for the entirety of the country—there’s a long-standing challenge there of how do we build up that capacity? How do we create curricula that people across the country can use?  The lack of sufficient talent in the AI sphere, or just sufficient understanding of what AI is by all of our people, is a long-standing challenge. We’ve recognized that for many years as it relates to STEM areas in general. But we do have a bit of a cultural challenge in terms of people thinking that the field is hard, or it’s geeky, or something like that. And so not as many people will enter the field.  We don’t currently have enough people to teach these fields. Many experts are leaving academia and going to industry. And it’s great that we have a thriving industry in this country in this space, but when we don’t have enough educators that can train the next generation, then that exacerbates the problem. So this is a very tough pillar in my mind, but it’s one that we really have to prioritize and continue to make progress in. The EU is working on legislation to regulate AI. Should the US adopt any of the same measures?  One area of clear commonality is understanding AI implications and the need for regulation through the lens of risk. Taking a sector-based approach of evaluating risk is something that we at a high level agree on. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is making important contributions in this space, in the development of the AI risk management framework.  The European Union is planning new legislation aimed at curbing the worst harms associated with artificial intelligence. They’re making good progress on this and anticipate having that framework out by the beginning of 2023. There are some nuances here—different people interpret risk differently, so it’s important to come to a common understanding of what risk is and what appropriate approaches to risk mitigation might be, and what potential harms might be. You’ve talked about the issue of bias in AI. Are there ways that the government can use regulation to help solve that problem?  There are both regulatory and nonregulatory ways to help. There are a lot of existing laws that already prohibit the use of any kind of system that’s discriminatory, and that would include AI. A good approach is to see how existing law already applies, and then clarify it specifically for AI and determine where the gaps are.  NIST came out with a report earlier this year on bias in AI. They mentioned a number of approaches that should be considered as it relates to governing in these areas, but a lot of it has to do with best practices. So it’s things like making sure that we’re constantly monitoring the systems, or that we provide opportunities for recourse if people believe that they’ve been harmed.  It’s making sure that we’re documenting the ways that these systems are trained, and on what data, so that we can make sure that we understand where bias could be creeping in. It’s also about accountability, and making sure that the developers and the users, the implementers of these systems, are accountable when these systems are not developed or used appropriately. What do you think is the right balance between public and private development of AI?  The private sector is investing significantly more than the federal government into AI R&D. But the nature of that investment is quite different. The investment that’s happening in the private sector is very much into products or services, whereas the federal government is investing in long-term, cutting-edge research that doesn’t necessarily have a market driver for investment but does potentially open the door to brand-new ways of doing AI. So on the R&D side, it’s very important for the federal government to invest in those areas that don’t have that industry-driving reason to invest.  Industry can partner with the federal government to help identify what some of those real-world challenges are. That would be fruitful for US federal investment.  There is so much that the government and industry can learn from each other. The government can learn about best practices or lessons learned that industry has developed for their own companies, and the government can focus on the appropriate guardrails that are needed for AI.

Deep learning can almost perfectly predict how ice forms,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/11/1057623/deep-learning-predicts-ice-formation/,2022-08-11,"<p>It’s a development that could significantly increase the accuracy of weather and climate forecasting.</p>
","Researchers have used deep learning to model more precisely than ever before how ice crystals form in the atmosphere. Their paper, published this week in PNAS, hints at the potential to significantly increase the accuracy of weather and climate forecasting. The researchers used deep learning to predict how atoms and molecules behave. First, models were trained on small-scale simulations of 64 water molecules to help them predict how electrons in atoms interact. The models then replicated those interactions on a larger scale, with more atoms and molecules. It’s this ability to precisely simulate electron interactions that allowed the team to accurately predict physical and chemical behavior.  “The properties of matter emerge from how electrons behave,” says Pablo Piaggi, a research fellow at Princeton University and the lead author on the study. “Simulating explicitly what happens at that level is a way to capture much more rich physical phenomena.” It’s the first time this method has been used to model something as complex as the formation of ice crystals, also known as ice nucleation. This is one of the first steps in the formation of clouds, which is where all precipitation comes from.  Xiaohong Liu, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University who was not involved in the study, says half of all precipitation events—whether snow or rain or sleet—begin as ice crystals, which then grow larger and result in precipitation. If researchers could model ice nucleation more accurately, it could give a big boost to weather prediction overall. Ice nucleation is currently predicted on the basis of laboratory experiments. Researchers collect data on ice formation under different laboratory conditions, and that data is fed into weather prediction models under similar real-world conditions. This method works well enough sometimes, but often it ends up being inaccurate because of the sheer number of variables involved in actual weather conditions. If even a few factors vary between the lab and the real world, the results can be quite different. “Your data is only valid for a certain region, temperature, or kind of laboratory setting,” Liu says. The firm worked with UK weather forecasters to create a model that was better at making short term predictions than existing systems. Predicting ice nucleation from the way electrons interact is much more precise, but it’s also very computationally expensive. It requires researchers to model at least 4,000 to 100,000 water molecules, and even on supercomputers, such a simulation could take years to run. Even that would only be able to model the interactions for 100 picoseconds, or 10-10 seconds—not long enough to observe the ice nucleation process. Using deep learning, however, researchers were able to run the calculations in just 10 days. The time duration was also 1,000 times longer—still a fraction of a second, but just enough to see nucleation. Of course, more accurate models of ice nucleation alone won’t make forecasting perfect, says Liu, since it is only a small though critical component of weather modeling. Other aspects are also important—understanding how water droplets and ice crystals grow, for example, and how they move and interact together under different conditions. Still, the ability to more accurately model how ice crystals form in the atmosphere would significantly improve weather predictions, especially those involving whether and how much it’s likely to rain or snow. It could also aid climate forecasting by improving the ability to model clouds, which affect the planet’s temperature in complex ways. Piaggi says future research could model ice nucleation when there are substances like smoke in the air, potentially improving the accuracy of models even more. Because of deep-learning techniques, it’s now possible to use electron interactions to model larger systems for longer periods of time. “That has opened essentially a new field,” Piaggi says. “It’s already having and will have an even greater role in simulations in chemistry and in our simulations of materials.” ","Researchers have used deep learning to model more precisely than ever before how ice crystals form in the atmosphere.

[PREROLL] [TR ID] Jennifer Strong: The applications of artificial intelligence are so embedded in our everyday lives it’s easy to forget it's there… But these systems, like ones powering Instagram filters or the price of a car ride home… can rely on pre-existing datasets that fail to paint a complete picture of consumers.  It means people become outliers in that data – often the same people who’ve historically been marginalized.  It’s why face recognition technologies are least accurate on women of color, and why ride-share services can actually be more expensive in low-income neighborhoods. So, how do we stop this from happening? Well would you believe a quote from Harry Potter and his wizarding world… might create a good starting point for this conversation? I’m Jennifer Strong and this episode, our producer Anthony Green brings you a conversation about equity from MIT Technology Review’s A-I conference, EmTech Digital. We’ll hear from Nicol Turner Lee—the director of the center for technology at the Brookings Institution—about what it takes to make effective AI policy. [EPISODE  IN:  Anthony Green: There's a quote from Harry Potter of all places.  Nicol Turner Lee: Oh Lord, I, I, I haven't seen the Harry Potter episodes since my kids were little so I'll try.  [Laughter] Anthony Green: Oh man. Uh, it's a pretty good one. No, it's, it's just kind of stuck with me over the years. I'm honestly not even otherwise a big fan, but, um, the quote goes, there will be a time where we must choose between what is right and what is easy and it feels like that applies pretty squarely to how companies design these systems. Right. So I guess my question is how can policy makers, right, start to push the needle in the right direction when it comes to favorable outcomes for AI in decision making?  Nicol Turner Lee: Well, that's a great question. And again, thank you for having me. You may be wondering why I'm sitting here. I'm a sociologist. I've had the privilege of being on this stage for a couple of conferences here at MIT. But I got into this… And before I answer your question, because I think the quote that you're referencing points to much of what my colleagues have talked about, which are the sociotechnical implications of these systems. Anthony Green: Mm-hmm. Nicol Turner Lee: So I've been doing this for about 30 years. And part of the challenge that we've had is that we've not seen equitable access to technology. And as we think about these emerging sophisticated systems, to your point, we have to think about the extent to which they have effects on regular everyday people, particularly people who are already marginalized. Already vulnerable in our society. So that quote has a lot of meaning because if we're not careful, the technology in and of itself will sort of accelerate, I think, some of the progress that we've made when it comes to equity and civil rights.  Anthony Green: Yeah.  Nicol Turner Lee: Um, I'm gonna date myself for just a moment. I know I look a lot younger. When I was growing up I used to run home and watch the Jetsons, right. There were two cartoons. I watched Fred Flinstone, which if you all remember, he rode around on a car with rocks and I watched the Jetsons.. Anthony Green: Powered with his feet.  Nicol Turner Lee: I know, right! You're too young to know about Fred Flinstone.  Anthony Green: Oh, Boomerang.  But, but if you notice. You know, Fred Flinstone is archaic. Right?  Anthony Green: Right. Nicol Turner Lee: The, the rocks as wheels doesn't work.  Anthony Green: Yeah.  Nicol Turner Lee: The Jetsons is actually realized. And part of the challenge and the reason that I have interest in this work outside of my, you know, PhD in sociology and my interest in technology is that these systems now are so much more generally purposed that they impact people when they are contextualized in environments. And that's where I think we have to have more conversations that point to your question. So roundabout way. But I think it's really important that we have these conversations now, before the technology accelerates itself. Anthony Green: Hundred percent. And I mean, you know, all of that said, right, policy making alone isn't going to be the only solution needed to resolve these issues. So I would love it if you can speak to how accountability, specifically on the part of industry, comes into play as well.  Nicol Turner Lee: Well, the problem with policy makers is that we're not necessarily technologists. And so we can see a problem and we actually sort of see that problem in its outcomes.  Anthony Green: Yeah.  Nicol Turner Lee: So I don't think there's any policy maker, or very few outside of people like Ro Khanna and others, right, who actually know what it's like to be in, in the tech space.  Anthony Green: Sure.  Nicol Turner Lee: That understands how these outcomes occur. They don't understand what's underneath the hood. Or as people say, I'm trying to move away from this language. It's not really a black box. Right. It's just a box. Anthony Green: Right. Nicol Turner Lee: Because there's some, uh, judgments that come with calling it a black box. But when you think about policy and those outcomes you have to say to yourself, how do policy makers sort of take an organic iterative model and then legislate or regulate it? And that's where people like me who are in the social sciences, I think, come in and have much more conversation on what they should be looking for. Um, so the accountability there is hard. Anthony Green: Yeah. Nicol Turner Lee: Because no one is talking the same language as many of you in this room, right. The technologists are sort of rushing to market. I call it permissionless forgiveness. Uh, as my colleagues at the center for technology innovation, Tom Wheeler has that great phrase, “build it and then break it and then come back and fix it.” Well, guess what happens? That's permissionless forgiveness. Cuz what happens? We say we're sorry when people have foreclosed, uh, mortgage rates, are in criminal justice systems where they're detained longer because these models dictate those predictions. Anthony Green: Right. Nicol Turner Lee: So policy makers have not quite, Anthony, caught up to the speed of innovation. And we've said that for decades, but it's actually true.  Anthony Green: Absolutely. I mean, you've referred to this issue in the past as a civil and human rights issue.  Nicol Turner Lee: It is. It is.  Anthony Green: Right. So, I mean, can you kind of like expand on that and how that's kind of shaped your conversations about policy? Nicol Turner Lee: You know, it's shaped my conversations from the standpoint of this. I, I, you know, shameless plug, I have a book coming out on the US digital divide so I've been very interested. I call it, uh, Digitally Invisible, how the internet is creating the new underclass. And it's really about the digital divide going past the binary construction of who's online, who's not, to really thinking about what are the impacts when you are not connected.  Anthony Green: Right.  Nicol Turner Lee: And how do these emerging technologies impact you? So to your point, I call it a civil rights issue because what the pandemic demonstrated is that without internet access, you were actually not able to get the same opportunities as everybody else. You could not register for your vaccine. You could not communicate with your friends and family. Fifty-million school aged kids sent home, 15 to 16 million of them could not learn. And now we're seeing the effects of that.  Anthony Green: Yeah.  Nicol Turner Lee: And so when we think about artificial intelligence systems that now have replaced what I call the death of analog. Replace, uh, you know, how we used to do things in person we're now seeing, in a civil rights age, laws that are being violated. And that.. in ways that I, I don’t necessarily attribute to the malfeasance of technologists. But what they're doing is they’re foreclosing on opportunities that people have fought hard for. Anthony Green: Sure.  Nicol Turner Lee: 2016 election. When we had foreign operatives come in and manipulate the content that was available to voters. That was a form of voter suppression.  Anthony Green: Right. Nicol Turner Lee: And there was no place that those folks could go to like the Supreme Court or Congress to say my vote was just taken away based on the deep neural networks that were associated with what they were seeing. Anthony Green: Yeah.  Nicol Turner Lee: Or the misinformation around polling. We're now at a state… when you are in a city like Boston and an Uber driver doesn't pick you up because he sees your face in the profile. Where do you go for the type of, um, you know, the benefits of, of the civil rights regime that we have that was not based on a digital atmosphere? So part of my work at Brookings has been how do we look at the flexibility and agility of these systems to apply to emerging technologies. And we have no simple answer because these rules were not necessarily developed , you know, in the 21st century. Anthony Green: Right. Nicol Turner Lee: They were developed when my grandfather told me how he walked to school with the same pair of shoes, right. Where the bottom was out because he wanted an education. We don't have that today. And I think it's worth a conversation as these technologies become more ubiquitous. How are we developing not just inclusive and equitable AI but legally compliant AI? AI that makes sense that people feel that they have some retribution for that malfeasance. So I'll talk a little bit about some of the work we're doing on there, but I think, you know, there's a cadre of individuals like myself, some of them here at MIT, that are really trying to figure out how do we go back and make people accountable to the civil and human liberties of folks and not allow the technology to be the fall person when it comes to, you know, why things wreck havoc or go wrong.  Anthony Green: Don't blame the robots.  Nicol Turner Lee: You know! I tell people robots do not discriminate. I'm sorry. You know, we do and, and it's something to be said about that. We start looking at civil rights.  Anthony Green: I'm gonna go to the audience. Anyone got a question?  Rene, audience member: Thank you so much, Renee from Sao Paulo, Brazil. Nicol Turner Lee: Hey! Rene, audience member: There is a common theme on these last presentations. It's about invisibility.  Nicol Turner Lee: Yes! Rene, audience member: There are so many ways to be invisible. If, if you have the wrong badge you are invisible, like Harry Potter. If you are too old, if you have the wrong kind of skin. And there's one very interesting thing. When we talk, we talk about data and AI. AI is proposing things about data that are available.  Nicol Turner Lee: Yeah.  Rene, audience member: But there are data that are completely invisible about people who are invisible. So what kind of solutions are we building if you are basing on data.. based on data about all, always the same people. How do we bring visibility to everybody? Yes! Rene, audience member: So, thank you so much.  Nicol Turner Lee: No, I love that question. Can I jump right in on this one?  Anthony Green: Go for it.  Nicol Turner Lee: You know, uh, my colleague and friend Renee Cummings, who is the AI, uh, scientist in residence at University of Virginia. She introduced me to, a few months ago and we did a podcast where she was featured, this concept of what's called data trauma. Anthony Green: Mmmm. Nicol Turner Lee: And I wanna sort of walk you through this because it blew me away when I began to think about the implications and it goes to Renee's question. What does it mean, you know, when we talk about AI, we often talk about the problem development, the data that we're training it on, the way that we're interpreting the outcomes or explaining them, but we never talk about the quality of the data and the fact that the data in and of itself holds within it, the, the wounds of our society. I don't care what people say. If you are training AI on criminal justice, um, issues, and you're trying to make a fair and equitable AI that recognizes who should be detained or who should be released. And we all know that particular algorithm I'm talking about. If it is trained on US data, it is disproportionately going to overrepresent people of color. So even though my friends, and I tell everybody this, just so you know, like she's not coming in here, you know, being angry. I tell everybody you need a social scientist as a friend. I don't care who you are. If you are a scientist, an engineer, a data scientist and you don't have one social scientist as your friend, you're not being honest to this problem. Right? Because what happens with that data? It comes with all of that noise. And despite our ability as scientists to sort of tease out that noise or diffuse the noise, you still have the basis and the foundation for the inequality. And so one of the things I've tried to tell people, it's probably okay for us to recognize the trauma of the data that we're using. It's okay for us to realize that our models will be normative in the extent to which there will be bias. Technical bias, societal bias, outcome bias and prediction bias, but we should disclose what those things are.  Anthony Green: Yeah.  Nicol Turner Lee: And that's where my work in particular has become really interesting to me as a person who is looking at this as, you know, the use of proxies and the use of data. For me, it becomes what part of the model is much more injurious to respondents and to outcomes. And what part should we disclose that we just don't have the right data to predict accurately without some type of, you know, risk… Anthony Green: Sure.  Nicol Turner Lee: …to that population.  Anthony Green: Yeah.  Nicol Turner Lee: So to your question, I think if we acknowledge that, you know, I think then we can get to a point where we can have these honest conversations on how we bring interdisciplinary context to certain situations. Anthony Green: We've got another question. Kyle, audience member: Hi Nicol. Nicol Turner Lee: Hey. Kyle, audience member: I'm grateful for your perspective. Um, my name is Kyle. I run… I'm a data scientist by training and I run a team of AI and ML designers and developers. And so, you know, it scares me how fast the industry's evolving. You mentioned GPT-3. We're already talking about GPT-4 is in the works and the exponential leap and capabilities that's gonna present. Something that you mentioned that really struck me is that legislators don't understand what we're doing.  And I don't believe that us as data scientists should be the ones making decisions about how to tie our hands behind our backs.  Nicol Turner Lee: Yeah.  Kyle, audience member: And how to protect our work from having unintended consequences. Nicol Turner Lee: Yes.  Kyle, audience member: So how do we engage and how do we help legislators understand the real risks and not the hype that is sometimes heard or perceived in the media?  Nicol Turner Lee: Yeah, no, I love that question. I'm actually gonna flip it. And I'm gonna talk about it in two ways in which I actually talk about it. So I do think that legislators who work in this space, particularly in those sensitive use cases. So I tell people, I give this example all the time. I love shopping for boots and I'm okay with the algorithm that tells me as a consumer that I love boots, but as Latonya Sweeney's work has indicated if you associate other things with me. Uh, what other, uh, attributes does this particular person have? When does she buy boots? How many boots does she have? Does she check her credit when she's buying boots? What kind of computer is she using when she's buying her boots? If you become to make that accumulative picture around me, then we run into what Dr. Sweeney has talked about—these associations that create that type of risk.  So to your first question, I think you're right. That policy makers should actually define the guardrails, but I don't think they need to do it for everything. I think we need to pick those areas that are most sensitive. The EU has called them high risk. And maybe we might take from that, some models that help us think about what's high risk and where should we spend more time and potentially policy makers, where should we spend time together? I'm a huge fan of regulatory sandboxes when it comes to co-design and co-evolution of feedback. Uh, I have an article coming out in an Oxford University press book on an incentive-based rating system that I could talk about in just a moment. But I also think on the flip side that all of you have to take account for your reputational risk. As we move into a much more digitally advanced society, it is incumbent upon developers to do their due diligence too. You can't afford as a company to go out and put an algorithm that you think, or an autonomous system that you think is the best idea, and then land up on the first page of the newspaper. Because what that does is it degrades the trustworthiness by your consumers of your product. And so what I tell, you know, both sides is that I think it's worth a conversation where we have certain guardrails when it comes to facial recognition technology, because we don't have the technical accuracy when it applies to all populations. When it comes to disparate impact on financial products and services.There are great models that I've found in my work, in the banking industry, where they actually have triggers because they have regulatory bodies that help them understand what proxies actually deliver disparate impact. There are areas that we just saw this right in the housing and appraisal market, where AI is being used to sort of, um, replace a subjective decision making, but contributing more to the type of discrimination and predatory appraisals that we see. There are certain cases that we actually need policy makers to impose guardrails, but more so be proactive. I tell policymakers all the time, you can't blame data scientists. If the data is horrible. Anthony Green: Right. Nicol Turner Lee: Put more money in R and D. Help us create better data sets that are overrepresented in certain areas or underrepresented in terms of minority populations. The key thing is, it has to work together. I don't think that we'll have a good winning solution if policy makers actually, you know, lead this or data scientists lead it by itself in certain areas. I think you really need people working together and collaborating on what those principles are. We create these models. Computers don't. We know what we're doing with these models when we're creating algorithms or autonomous systems or ad targeting. We know! We in this room, we cannot sit back and say, we don't understand why we use these technologies. We know because they actually have a precedent for how they've been expanded in our society, but we need some accountability. And that's really what I'm trying to get at. Who's making us accountable for these systems that we're creating? It's so interesting, Anthony, these last few, uh, weeks, as many of us have watched the, uh, conflict in Ukraine. My daughter, because I have a 15 year old, has come to me with a variety of TikToks and other things that she's seen to sort of say, “Hey mom, did you know that this is happening?” And I've had to sort of pull myself back cause I've gotten really involved in the conversation, not knowing that in some ways, once I go down that path with her. I'm going deeper and deeper and deeper into that well. Anthony Green: Yeah. Nicol Turner Lee: And I think for us as scientists, it kind of goes back to this. I Have a Dream speech. We have to determine which side of history we wanna be on with this technology folks. And how far down the rabbit hole do we wanna go to contribute? I think what the greatness of AI is our ability to have human cognition wrapped up in these repetitive processes that go way beyond our wildest imagination of the Jetsons. And that allows us to do things that none of us have been able to do in our lifetime. Where do we want to sit on the right side of history? And how do we want to handle these technologies so that we create better scientists?  Anthony Green: Sure.  Nicol Turner Lee: Not ones that are worse. And I think that's a valid question to ask of this group. And it's a valid question to ask of yourself.  Anthony Green: I don't know if we can end on anything better and we're out of time! Nicol, we can go all day but.. Nicol Turner Lee: I know. I always feel like a Baptist preacher, you know, so if I have energy about it… Anthony Green: Choir, can you sing it?  Nicol Turner Lee: I know, right. I can't sing it, but you can do that I Have A Dream speech, Anthony.  [Laughter]  Anthony Green: Oh man. You're putting me on the stand and I'm already on stage.  Nicol Turner Lee: Yeah, right haha.  Anthony Green: Nicol, thank you so much.  Nicol Turner Lee: Thank you so much as well. Appreciate it.  Anthony Green: Absolutely.  Nicol Turner Lee: Thank you everybody here. [MIDROLL AD] Jennifer Strong: This episode was produced by Anthony Green, Erin Underwood, and Emma Cillekens.

[PREROLL] [TR ID] Jennifer Strong: The applications of artificial intelligence are so embedded in our everyday lives it’s easy to forget it's there… But these systems, like ones powering Instagram filters or the price of a car ride home… can rely on pre-existing datasets that fail to paint a complete picture of consumers. It means people become outliers in that data – often the same people who’ve historically been marginalized. It’s why face recognition technologies are least accurate on women of color, and why ride-share services can actually be more expensive in low-income neighborhoods. So, how do we stop this from happening? Well would you believe a quote from Harry Potter and his wizarding world… might create a good starting point for this conversation? I’m Jennifer Strong and this episode, our producer Anthony Green brings you a conversation about equity from MIT Technology Review’s A-I conference, EmTech Digital. We’ll hear from Nicol Turner Lee—the director of the center for technology at the Brookings Institution—about what it takes to make effective AI policy. [EPISODE IN: Anthony Green: There's a quote from Harry Potter of all places. Nicol Turner Lee: Oh Lord, I, I, I haven't seen the Harry Potter episodes since my kids were little so I'll try. [Laughter] Anthony Green: Oh man. Uh, it's a pretty good one. No, it's, it's just kind of stuck with me over the years. I'm honestly not even otherwise a big fan, but, um, the quote goes, there will be a time where we must choose between what is right and what is easy and it feels like that applies pretty squarely to how companies design these systems. Right. So I guess my question is how can policy makers, right, start to push the needle in the right direction when it comes to favorable outcomes for AI in decision making? Nicol Turner Lee: Well, that's a great question. And again, thank you for having me. You may be wondering why I'm sitting here. I'm a sociologist. I've had the privilege of being on this stage for a couple of conferences here at MIT. But I got into this… And before I answer your question, because I think the quote that you're referencing points to much of what my colleagues have talked about, which are the sociotechnical implications of these systems. Anthony Green: Mm-hmm. Nicol Turner Lee: So I've been doing this for about 30 years. And part of the challenge that we've had is that we've not seen equitable access to technology. And as we think about these emerging sophisticated systems, to your point, we have to think about the extent to which they have effects on regular everyday people, particularly people who are already marginalized. Already vulnerable in our society. So that quote has a lot of meaning because if we're not careful, the technology in and of itself will sort of accelerate, I think, some of the progress that we've made when it comes to equity and civil rights. Anthony Green: Yeah. Nicol Turner Lee: Um, I'm gonna date myself for just a moment. I know I look a lot younger. When I was growing up I used to run home and watch the Jetsons, right. There were two cartoons. I watched Fred Flinstone, which if you all remember, he rode around on a car with rocks and I watched the Jetsons.. Anthony Green: Powered with his feet. Nicol Turner Lee: I know, right! You're too young to know about Fred Flinstone. Anthony Green: Oh, Boomerang. But, but if you notice. You know, Fred Flinstone is archaic. Right? Anthony Green: Right. Nicol Turner Lee: The, the rocks as wheels doesn't work. Anthony Green: Yeah. Nicol Turner Lee: The Jetsons is actually realized. And part of the challenge and the reason that I have interest in this work outside of my, you know, PhD in sociology and my interest in technology is that these systems now are so much more generally purposed that they impact people when they are contextualized in environments. And that's where I think we have to have more conversations that point to your question. So roundabout way. But I think it's really important that we have these conversations now, before the technology accelerates itself. Anthony Green: Hundred percent. And I mean, you know, all of that said, right, policy making alone isn't going to be the only solution needed to resolve these issues. So I would love it if you can speak to how accountability, specifically on the part of industry, comes into play as well. Nicol Turner Lee: Well, the problem with policy makers is that we're not necessarily technologists. And so we can see a problem and we actually sort of see that problem in its outcomes. Anthony Green: Yeah. Nicol Turner Lee: So I don't think there's any policy maker, or very few outside of people like Ro Khanna and others, right, who actually know what it's like to be in, in the tech space. Anthony Green: Sure. Nicol Turner Lee: That understands how these outcomes occur. They don't understand what's underneath the hood. Or as people say, I'm trying to move away from this language. It's not really a black box. Right. It's just a box. Anthony Green: Right. Nicol Turner Lee: Because there's some, uh, judgments that come with calling it a black box. But when you think about policy and those outcomes you have to say to yourself, how do policy makers sort of take an organic iterative model and then legislate or regulate it? And that's where people like me who are in the social sciences, I think, come in and have much more conversation on what they should be looking for. Um, so the accountability there is hard. Anthony Green: Yeah. Nicol Turner Lee: Because no one is talking the same language as many of you in this room, right. The technologists are sort of rushing to market. I call it permissionless forgiveness. Uh, as my colleagues at the center for technology innovation, Tom Wheeler has that great phrase, “build it and then break it and then come back and fix it.” Well, guess what happens? That's permissionless forgiveness. Cuz what happens? We say we're sorry when people have foreclosed, uh, mortgage rates, are in criminal justice systems where they're detained longer because these models dictate those predictions. Anthony Green: Right. Nicol Turner Lee: So policy makers have not quite, Anthony, caught up to the speed of innovation. And we've said that for decades, but it's actually true. Anthony Green: Absolutely. I mean, you've referred to this issue in the past as a civil and human rights issue. Nicol Turner Lee: It is. It is. Anthony Green: Right. So, I mean, can you kind of like expand on that and how that's kind of shaped your conversations about policy? Nicol Turner Lee: You know, it's shaped my conversations from the standpoint of this. I, I, you know, shameless plug, I have a book coming out on the US digital divide so I've been very interested. I call it, uh, Digitally Invisible, how the internet is creating the new underclass. And it's really about the digital divide going past the binary construction of who's online, who's not, to really thinking about what are the impacts when you are not connected. Anthony Green: Right. Nicol Turner Lee: And how do these emerging technologies impact you? So to your point, I call it a civil rights issue because what the pandemic demonstrated is that without internet access, you were actually not able to get the same opportunities as everybody else. You could not register for your vaccine. You could not communicate with your friends and family. Fifty-million school aged kids sent home, 15 to 16 million of them could not learn. And now we're seeing the effects of that. Anthony Green: Yeah. Nicol Turner Lee: And so when we think about artificial intelligence systems that now have replaced what I call the death of analog. Replace, uh, you know, how we used to do things in person we're now seeing, in a civil rights age, laws that are being violated. And that.. in ways that I, I don’t necessarily attribute to the malfeasance of technologists. But what they're doing is they’re foreclosing on opportunities that people have fought hard for. Anthony Green: Sure. Nicol Turner Lee: 2016 election. When we had foreign operatives come in and manipulate the content that was available to voters. That was a form of voter suppression. Anthony Green: Right. Nicol Turner Lee: And there was no place that those folks could go to like the Supreme Court or Congress to say my vote was just taken away based on the deep neural networks that were associated with what they were seeing. Anthony Green: Yeah. Nicol Turner Lee: Or the misinformation around polling. We're now at a state… when you are in a city like Boston and an Uber driver doesn't pick you up because he sees your face in the profile. Where do you go for the type of, um, you know, the benefits of, of the civil rights regime that we have that was not based on a digital atmosphere? So part of my work at Brookings has been how do we look at the flexibility and agility of these systems to apply to emerging technologies. And we have no simple answer because these rules were not necessarily developed , you know, in the 21st century. Anthony Green: Right. Nicol Turner Lee: They were developed when my grandfather told me how he walked to school with the same pair of shoes, right. Where the bottom was out because he wanted an education. We don't have that today. And I think it's worth a conversation as these technologies become more ubiquitous. How are we developing not just inclusive and equitable AI but legally compliant AI? AI that makes sense that people feel that they have some retribution for that malfeasance. So I'll talk a little bit about some of the work we're doing on there, but I think, you know, there's a cadre of individuals like myself, some of them here at MIT, that are really trying to figure out how do we go back and make people accountable to the civil and human liberties of folks and not allow the technology to be the fall person when it comes to, you know, why things wreck havoc or go wrong. Anthony Green: Don't blame the robots. Nicol Turner Lee: You know! I tell people robots do not discriminate. I'm sorry. You know, we do and, and it's something to be said about that. We start looking at civil rights. Anthony Green: I'm gonna go to the audience. Anyone got a question? Rene, audience member: Thank you so much, Renee from Sao Paulo, Brazil. Nicol Turner Lee: Hey! Rene, audience member: There is a common theme on these last presentations. It's about invisibility. Nicol Turner Lee: Yes! Rene, audience member: There are so many ways to be invisible. If, if you have the wrong badge you are invisible, like Harry Potter. If you are too old, if you have the wrong kind of skin. And there's one very interesting thing. When we talk, we talk about data and AI. AI is proposing things about data that are available. Nicol Turner Lee: Yeah. Rene, audience member: But there are data that are completely invisible about people who are invisible. So what kind of solutions are we building if you are basing on data.. based on data about all, always the same people. How do we bring visibility to everybody? Yes! Rene, audience member: So, thank you so much. Nicol Turner Lee: No, I love that question. Can I jump right in on this one? Anthony Green: Go for it. Nicol Turner Lee: You know, uh, my colleague and friend Renee Cummings, who is the AI, uh, scientist in residence at University of Virginia. She introduced me to, a few months ago and we did a podcast where she was featured, this concept of what's called data trauma. Anthony Green: Mmmm. Nicol Turner Lee: And I wanna sort of walk you through this because it blew me away when I began to think about the implications and it goes to Renee's question. What does it mean, you know, when we talk about AI, we often talk about the problem development, the data that we're training it on, the way that we're interpreting the outcomes or explaining them, but we never talk about the quality of the data and the fact that the data in and of itself holds within it, the, the wounds of our society. I don't care what people say. If you are training AI on criminal justice, um, issues, and you're trying to make a fair and equitable AI that recognizes who should be detained or who should be released. And we all know that particular algorithm I'm talking about. If it is trained on US data, it is disproportionately going to overrepresent people of color. So even though my friends, and I tell everybody this, just so you know, like she's not coming in here, you know, being angry. I tell everybody you need a social scientist as a friend. I don't care who you are. If you are a scientist, an engineer, a data scientist and you don't have one social scientist as your friend, you're not being honest to this problem. Right? Because what happens with that data? It comes with all of that noise. And despite our ability as scientists to sort of tease out that noise or diffuse the noise, you still have the basis and the foundation for the inequality. And so one of the things I've tried to tell people, it's probably okay for us to recognize the trauma of the data that we're using. It's okay for us to realize that our models will be normative in the extent to which there will be bias. Technical bias, societal bias, outcome bias and prediction bias, but we should disclose what those things are. Anthony Green: Yeah. Nicol Turner Lee: And that's where my work in particular has become really interesting to me as a person who is looking at this as, you know, the use of proxies and the use of data. For me, it becomes what part of the model is much more injurious to respondents and to outcomes. And what part should we disclose that we just don't have the right data to predict accurately without some type of, you know, risk… Anthony Green: Sure. Nicol Turner Lee: …to that population. Anthony Green: Yeah. Nicol Turner Lee: So to your question, I think if we acknowledge that, you know, I think then we can get to a point where we can have these honest conversations on how we bring interdisciplinary context to certain situations. Anthony Green: We've got another question. Kyle, audience member: Hi Nicol. Nicol Turner Lee: Hey. Kyle, audience member: I'm grateful for your perspective. Um, my name is Kyle. I run… I'm a data scientist by training and I run a team of AI and ML designers and developers. And so, you know, it scares me how fast the industry's evolving. You mentioned GPT-3. We're already talking about GPT-4 is in the works and the exponential leap and capabilities that's gonna present. Something that you mentioned that really struck me is that legislators don't understand what we're doing. And I don't believe that us as data scientists should be the ones making decisions about how to tie our hands behind our backs. Nicol Turner Lee: Yeah. Kyle, audience member: And how to protect our work from having unintended consequences. Nicol Turner Lee: Yes. Kyle, audience member: So how do we engage and how do we help legislators understand the real risks and not the hype that is sometimes heard or perceived in the media? Nicol Turner Lee: Yeah, no, I love that question. I'm actually gonna flip it. And I'm gonna talk about it in two ways in which I actually talk about it. So I do think that legislators who work in this space, particularly in those sensitive use cases. So I tell people, I give this example all the time. I love shopping for boots and I'm okay with the algorithm that tells me as a consumer that I love boots, but as Latonya Sweeney's work has indicated if you associate other things with me. Uh, what other, uh, attributes does this particular person have? When does she buy boots? How many boots does she have? Does she check her credit when she's buying boots? What kind of computer is she using when she's buying her boots? If you become to make that accumulative picture around me, then we run into what Dr. Sweeney has talked about—these associations that create that type of risk. So to your first question, I think you're right. That policy makers should actually define the guardrails, but I don't think they need to do it for everything. I think we need to pick those areas that are most sensitive. The EU has called them high risk. And maybe we might take from that, some models that help us think about what's high risk and where should we spend more time and potentially policy makers, where should we spend time together? I'm a huge fan of regulatory sandboxes when it comes to co-design and co-evolution of feedback. Uh, I have an article coming out in an Oxford University press book on an incentive-based rating system that I could talk about in just a moment. But I also think on the flip side that all of you have to take account for your reputational risk. As we move into a much more digitally advanced society, it is incumbent upon developers to do their due diligence too. You can't afford as a company to go out and put an algorithm that you think, or an autonomous system that you think is the best idea, and then land up on the first page of the newspaper. Because what that does is it degrades the trustworthiness by your consumers of your product. And so what I tell, you know, both sides is that I think it's worth a conversation where we have certain guardrails when it comes to facial recognition technology, because we don't have the technical accuracy when it applies to all populations. When it comes to disparate impact on financial products and services.There are great models that I've found in my work, in the banking industry, where they actually have triggers because they have regulatory bodies that help them understand what proxies actually deliver disparate impact. There are areas that we just saw this right in the housing and appraisal market, where AI is being used to sort of, um, replace a subjective decision making, but contributing more to the type of discrimination and predatory appraisals that we see. There are certain cases that we actually need policy makers to impose guardrails, but more so be proactive. I tell policymakers all the time, you can't blame data scientists. If the data is horrible. Anthony Green: Right. Nicol Turner Lee: Put more money in R and D. Help us create better data sets that are overrepresented in certain areas or underrepresented in terms of minority populations. The key thing is, it has to work together. I don't think that we'll have a good winning solution if policy makers actually, you know, lead this or data scientists lead it by itself in certain areas. I think you really need people working together and collaborating on what those principles are. We create these models. Computers don't. We know what we're doing with these models when we're creating algorithms or autonomous systems or ad targeting. We know! We in this room, we cannot sit back and say, we don't understand why we use these technologies. We know because they actually have a precedent for how they've been expanded in our society, but we need some accountability. And that's really what I'm trying to get at. Who's making us accountable for these systems that we're creating? It's so interesting, Anthony, these last few, uh, weeks, as many of us have watched the, uh, conflict in Ukraine. My daughter, because I have a 15 year old, has come to me with a variety of TikToks and other things that she's seen to sort of say, “Hey mom, did you know that this is happening?” And I've had to sort of pull myself back cause I've gotten really involved in the conversation, not knowing that in some ways, once I go down that path with her. I'm going deeper and deeper and deeper into that well. Anthony Green: Yeah. Nicol Turner Lee: And I think for us as scientists, it kind of goes back to this. I Have a Dream speech. We have to determine which side of history we wanna be on with this technology folks. And how far down the rabbit hole do we wanna go to contribute? I think what the greatness of AI is our ability to have human cognition wrapped up in these repetitive processes that go way beyond our wildest imagination of the Jetsons. And that allows us to do things that none of us have been able to do in our lifetime. Where do we want to sit on the right side of history? And how do we want to handle these technologies so that we create better scientists? Anthony Green: Sure. Nicol Turner Lee: Not ones that are worse. And I think that's a valid question to ask of this group. And it's a valid question to ask of yourself. Anthony Green: I don't know if we can end on anything better and we're out of time! Nicol, we can go all day but.. Nicol Turner Lee: I know. I always feel like a Baptist preacher, you know, so if I have energy about it… Anthony Green: Choir, can you sing it? Nicol Turner Lee: I know, right. I can't sing it, but you can do that I Have A Dream speech, Anthony. [Laughter] Anthony Green: Oh man. You're putting me on the stand and I'm already on stage. Nicol Turner Lee: Yeah, right haha. Anthony Green: Nicol, thank you so much. Nicol Turner Lee: Thank you so much as well. Appreciate it. Anthony Green: Absolutely. Nicol Turner Lee: Thank you everybody here. [MIDROLL AD] Jennifer Strong: This episode was produced by Anthony Green, Erin Underwood, and Emma Cillekens.

Automated techniques could make it easier to develop AI,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/05/1056814/automation-ai-machine-learning-automl/,2022-08-05,"<p>Automated machine learning promises to speed up the process of developing AI models and make the technology more accessible.</p>
","Machine-learning researchers make many decisions when designing new models. They decide how many layers to include in neural networks and what weights to give inputs at each node. The result of all this human decision-making is that complex models end up being “designed by intuition” rather than systematically, says Frank Hutter, head of the machine-learning lab at the University of Freiburg in Germany. A growing field called automated machine learning, or autoML, aims to eliminate the guesswork. The idea is to have algorithms take over the decisions that researchers currently have to make when designing models. Ultimately, these techniques could make machine learning more accessible.  Although automated machine learning has been around for almost a decade, researchers are still working to refine it. Last week, a new conference in Baltimore—which organizers described as the first international conference on the subject—showcased efforts to improve autoML’s accuracy and streamline its performance.  There’s been a swell of interest in autoML’s potential to simplify machine learning. Companies like Amazon and Google already offer low-code machine-learning tools that take advantage of autoML techniques. If these techniques become more efficient, it could accelerate research and allow more people to use machine learning. The idea is to get to a point where people can choose a question they want to ask, point an autoML tool at it, and receive the result they are looking for. That vision is the “holy grail of computer science,” says Lars Kotthoff, a conference organizer and assistant professor of computer science at the University of Wyoming. “You specify the problem, and the computer figures out how to solve it—and that’s all you do.” But first, researchers will have to figure out how to make these techniques more time and energy efficient. At first glance, the concept of autoML might seem redundant—after all, machine learning is already about automating the process of gaining insights from data. But because autoML algorithms operate at a level of abstraction above the underlying machine-learning models, relying only on the outputs of those models as guides, they can save time and computation. Researchers can apply autoML techniques to pre-trained models to gain fresh insights without wasting computation power repeating existing research. For example, research scientist Mehdi Bahrami and his coauthors at Fujitsu Research of America presented recent work on how to use a BERT-sort algorithm with different pre-trained models to adapt them for new purposes. BERT-sort is an algorithm that can figure out what is called “semantic order” when trained on data sets—given data on movie reviews, for example, it knows that “great” movies rank higher than “good” and “bad” movies.  With autoML techniques, the learned semantic order can also be extrapolated to classifying things like cancer diagnoses or even text in the Korean language, cutting down on time and computation.  Humans have struggled to make truly intelligent machines. Maybe we need to let them get on with it themselves. “BERT takes months of computation and is very expensive—like, a million dollars to generate that model and repeat those processes,” Bahrami says. “So if everyone wants to do the same thing, then it’s expensive—it’s not energy efficient, not good for the world.”  Although the field shows promise, researchers are still searching for ways to make autoML techniques more computationally efficient. For example, methods like neural architecture search currently build and test many different models to find the best fit, and the energy it takes to complete all those iterations can be significant. AutoML techniques can also be applied to machine-learning algorithms that don’t involve neural networks, like creating random decision forests or support-vector machines to classify data. Research in those areas is further along, with many coding libraries already available for people who want to incorporate autoML techniques into their projects.  The next step is to use autoML to quantify uncertainty and address questions of trustworthiness and fairness in the algorithms, says Hutter, a conference organizer. In that vision, standards around trustworthiness and fairness would be akin to any other machine-learning constraints, like accuracy. And autoML could capture and automatically correct biases found in those algorithms before they’re released. But for something like deep learning, autoML still has a long way to go. Data used to train deep-learning models, like images, documents, and recorded speech, is usually dense and complicated. It takes immense computational power to handle. The cost and time for training these models can be prohibitive for anyone other than researchers working at deep-pocketed private companies.  One of the competitions at the conference asked participants to develop energy-efficient alternative algorithms for neural architecture search. It’s a considerable challenge because this technique has infamous computational demands. It automatically cycles through countless deep-learning models to help researchers pick the right one for their application, but the process can take months and cost over a million dollars.  The goal of these alternative algorithms, called zero-cost neural architecture search proxies, is to make neural architecture search more accessible and environmentally friendly by significantly cutting down on its appetite for computation. The result takes only a few seconds to run, instead of months. These techniques are still in the early stages of development and are often unreliable, but machine-learning researchers predict that they have the potential to make the model selection process much more efficient.

DeepMind has predicted the structure of almost every protein known to science,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/07/28/1056510/deepmind-predicted-the-structure-of-almost-every-protein-known-to-science/,2022-07-28,"<p>And it’s giving the data away for free, which could spur new scientific discoveries.</p>
","DeepMind says its AlphaFold tool has successfully predicted the structure of nearly all proteins known to science. From today, the Alphabet-owned AI lab is offering its database of over 200 million proteins to anyone for free.  When DeepMind introduced AlphaFold in 2020, it took the science community by surprise. Scientists had spent decades trying to understand how proteins, which are essential to life, are structured; it was considered one of the “grand challenges” of biology. Understanding how they are shaped is crucial to understanding how they function.  Last year, DeepMind released the source code of AlphaFold and made the structures of 1 million proteins, including nearly every protein in the human body, available in its AlphaFold Protein Structure Database. The database was built together with the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, an international public research institute that already hosts a large database of protein information. The latest data release gives the database a massive boost. The update includes structures for “plants, bacteria, animals, and many, many other organisms, opening up huge opportunities for AlphaFold to have impact on important issues such as sustainability, fuel, food insecurity, and neglected diseases,” Demis Hassabis, DeepMind’s founder and CEO, told reporters on a call this week.  A year after it took biologists by surprise, AlphaFold has changed how researchers work and set DeepMind on a new course. The expanded database could act as an important resource for scientists, helping them to better understand diseases. It could also speed innovation in drug discovery and biology.  “AlphaFold is probably the most major contribution from the AI community to the scientific community,” said Jian Peng, a computer science professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who specialises in computational biology.  Since its release in 2020, researchers have already used AlphaFold to understand proteins that affect the health of honeybees and to develop an effective malaria vaccine.  The database allows researchers to look up 3D structures of proteins “almost as easily as doing a keyword Google search,” said Hassabis.  Predicting the structures of proteins is very time consuming, and having a tool with 200 million readily available protein structures will save researchers a lot of time, said Mohammed AlQuraishi, a systems biologist at Columbia University, who is not involved in DeepMind’s research.  AlphaFold could also help scientists to reassess previous research to better understand how diseases happen, Peng said.  However, for many proteins “we’re interested in understanding how their structure is altered by mutations and natural allelic variation, and that won’t be addressed by this database,” said AlQuraishi. “But of course the field is developing fast, and so I expect tools to accurately model protein variants will begin to appear soon,” he added.  The quality of AlphaFold’s predictions may also not be as accurate for rarer proteins with less available evolutionary information, says Peng.   The move is the latest development in DeepMind’s push into “digital biology,” where “AI and computational methods can help to understand and model important biological processes,” said Hassabis. Hassabis also leads a new venture, also owned by Alphabet, called Isomorphic Labs, which is developing AI for drug discovery.  Pushmeet Kohli, head of AI for science at DeepMind, said the company has plenty of challenges in the life sciences it still wants to tackle, such as how proteins behave and interact with other proteins.  Hassabis said his dream is that AI could not just help figure out the structure of proteins, but become a “significant part of the discovery process for new drugs and cures.” ","DeepMind says its AlphaFold tool has successfully predicted the structure of nearly all proteins known to science.

Hassabis said his dream is that AI could not just help figure out the structure of proteins, but become a “significant part of the discovery process for new drugs and cures.”","['say', 'alphafold', 'tool', 'successfully', 'predict', 'structure', 'protein', 'know', 'science', 'today', 'alphabetowne', 'ai', 'lab', 'offer', 'database', 'protein', 'free', 'introduce', 'alphafold', 'take', 'science', 'community', 'surprise', 'scientist', 'spend', 'decade', 'try', 'understand', 'protein', 'essential', 'life', 'structure', 'consider', 'grand', 'challenge', 'biology', 'understand', 'shape', 'crucial', 'understand', 'function', 'last', 'year', 'deepmind', 'release', 'source', 'code', 'alphafold', 'make', 'structure', 'protein', 'include', 'nearly', 'protein', 'human', 'body', 'available', 'alphafold', 'protein', 'structure', 'database', 'database', 'build', 'together', 'biology', 'laboratory', 'international', 'public', 'research', 'institute', 'already', 'host', 'large', 'database', 'protein', 'information', 'late', 'data', 'release', 'give', 'database', 'massive', 'boost', 'update', 'include', 'structure', 'plant', 'bacteria', 'animal', 'many', 'many', 'organism', 'open', 'huge', 'opportunity', 'alphafold', 'impact', 'important', 'issue', 'sustainability', 'fuel', 'food', 'insecurity', 'neglected', 'disease', 'demis', 'founder', 'ceo', 'tell', 'reporter', 'call', 'week', 'year', 'take', 'biologist', 'surprise', 'change', 'researcher', 'work', 'set', 'deepmind', 'new', 'course', 'expand', 'database', 'act', 'important', 'resource', 'scientist', 'help', 'well', 'understand', 'disease', 'also', 'speed', 'innovation', 'drug', 'discovery', 'biology', 'alphafold', 'probably', 'major', 'contribution', 'community', 'scientific', 'community', 'say', 'computer', 'science', 'professor', 'urbanachampaign', 'specialise', 'computational', 'biology', 'release', 'researcher', 'already', 'use', 'alphafold', 'understand', 'protein', 'affect', 'health', 'honeybee', 'develop', 'effective', 'malaria', 'vaccine', 'database', 'allow', 'researcher', 'look', 'structure', 'protein', 'almost', 'easily', 'search', 'say', 'hassabis', 'predict', 'structure', 'protein', 'time', 'consume', 'tool', 'readily', 'available', 'protein', 'structure', 'save', 'researcher', 'lot', 'time', 'say', 'system', 'biologist', 'involve', 'research', 'alphafold', 'also', 'help', 'scientist', 'reassess', 'previous', 'research', 'well', 'understand', 'disease', 'happen', 'say', 'however', 'many', 'protein', '’re', 'interested', 'understand', 'structure', 'alter', 'mutation', 'natural', 'allelic', 'variation', 'address', 'database', 'say', 'course', 'field', 'develop', 'fast', 'expect', 'tool', 'accurately', 'model', 'protein', 'variant', 'begin', 'appear', 'soon', 'add', 'quality', 'alphafold', 'prediction', 'also', 'accurate', 'rare', 'protein', 'less', 'available', 'evolutionary', 'information', 'say', 'move', 'late', 'development', 'deepmind', 'push', 'digital', 'biology', 'computational', 'method', 'help', 'understand', 'model', 'important', 'biological', 'process', 'say', 'also', 'lead', 'new', 'venture', 'also', 'alphabet', 'call', 'isomorphic', 'lab', 'develop', 'ai', 'drug', 'discovery', 'pushmeet', 'head', 'ai', 'science', 'deepmind', 'say', 'company', 'plenty', 'challenge', 'life', 'science', 'still', 'want', 'tackle', 'protein', 'behave', 'interact', 'protein', 'say', 'dream', 'ai', 'help', 'figure', 'structure', 'protein', 'become', 'significant', 'part', 'discovery', 'process', 'new', 'drug', 'cure']"
Podcast: Can AI keep guns out of schools?,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/07/27/1057112/podcast-can-ai-keep-guns-out-of-schools/,2022-07-27,,"Amid a growing epidemic of gun violence, can AI be part of the solution? In this episode we look at some of the weapons detection technologies schools are using in an effort to try to keep students safe.  This episode was produced by Anthony Green and Emma Cillekens with reporting from Mark Keierleber. It was edited by Jennifer Strong, Rachel Courtland and Mat Honan, mixed by Garret Lang, with original music from Jacob Gorski.  [PREROLL] [TR ID] Gary Hough: You think about what that feeling must have been like in, in the hearts and minds of, of, of those parents and grandparents and uncles and aunts and relatives and the other children in that school.  Jennifer: He’s talking about school shootings… and the growing epidemic of gun violence in the US.  Gary Hough: I think we have to reach out in a national movement to do our best to protect our young people. My name is Gary Hough. I am the superintendent of Fayette County schools in Fayette County, West Virginia.  Jennifer: His district has been installing AI-enabled systems that are meant to detect guns and other weapons at school entrances. And so far, he’s finding them useful.   Gary Hough: We don't have to have that long line that you deal with with the old metal detector scanners. They are able to roll straight through the process. Jennifer: Students don’t have to slow down to pass through… stopping only if an alarm goes off. He says this is important… because long lines present a safety hazard. Gary Hough: You know, when they're getting off those school buses and coming in, or getting out of the cars and coming in, that period of time that they're delayed coming through that front door where, you know, you're enclosed in a controlled area. They're in a vulnerable setting. This permits us to do the scanning without putting our students in that situation. Jennifer: These machines sometimes catch things that shouldn't be there… including brass knuckles. But he also says, false positives are a daily occurrence… and school issued laptops are often mistaken for weapons… So students now take their Chromebooks out of their bags and hold them up as they pass through the entrance.   Gary Hough: You know, those are the kind of things that we had to train our people to do so that it doesn't stop them, but it's not like what you have when you have the belts and the scanners, you have to take all the change out of your pocket. Change and keys, do not set it off. You know what I mean? It already is programmed into there that that's not a security risk. Jennifer: He’s talking about a system from a company called Evolv… and we’ll meet one of the founders in just a bit. The product looks a lot like those plastic towers inside stores that detect shoplifting. It’s there in plain sight, but you don’t really notice it unless it goes off.  I know, because my microphone set one off recently in New York City. But, unlike a standard metal detector… this one uses AI to keep it from going off over things like phones and keys. Gary Hough: I think our parents were very pleased and continue to be pleased because of the level of technology that we have. Is this a kind of a fix-all for the problem? No, it's not, but it's a good tool in your tool chest as a school administrator to know you've done everything you can.  Jennifer: I’m Jennifer Strong and this episode we explore some of the AI technologies that schools are looking to, to try to help keep students safe.  [SHOW ID] Jennifer: The conversation on school safety has long been about preventing mass shootings. But the pandemic caused a shift in that conversation… towards stopping the spread of the virus… with products like temperature sensors and cameras that detect masks.  For many school districts, this shift also marked the beginning of security protocols driven by AI. Mark Keierleber:  So now some of these folks who implemented these cameras… you know I talked to the security chief in Fulton county, Georgia, which is Metro Atlanta and they installed a system that detects masks and he specifically talked about how, you know, well, in a post pandemic environment, we may not be checking for masks, but this is a precursor to other forms of technology, specifically weapons detection. My name's Mark Keierleber.  I'm an investigative reporter at The 74, a national K-12 education news website.  Jennifer: He covers security and surveillance technology in schools.  Mark Keierleber: That can range from metal detectors to locks inside classrooms to bulletproof blankets.  Jennifer: You heard that right… he said bulletproof blankets… which are among a whole host of bulletproof school supplies. Mark Keierleber: There are bulletproof backpacks. There are bulletproof whiteboards. There are bulletproof shields that are designed to hang in a classroom next to the fire extinguisher. There's basically anything that you can think about inside of a school… has been redesigned in the last few years to be bulletproof.  Jennifer: But he says the real focus in school security is on using AI and other tech to find weapons. Schools that use the kinds of technologies he reports on to try to prevent gun violence… could benefit from a bill introduced by Congress in June. It would pump hundreds of millions of dollars into a program started in response to previous school shootings. Mark Keierleber: So the idea is they've programmed the cameras to identify what, you know, a gun looks like in terms of its shape. There's one company that was marketing a gun detection system a few years ago where it was also equipped with speakers in the hallway. And it would say, like it would detect the gun and the speakers would, like, a robot would come across the speakers and say “warning, we have detected a gun please be advised that law enforcement is on the way.” Jennifer: That product comes from a company called Athena Security… which makes a variety of weapons detection products. Instructor: Okay. What you see in the bottom left hand corner is the live video feed.  Jennifer: This is taken from a demo the company posted on YouTube. Instructor: Upper left hand corner is our alerting platform and in the right you're gonna see the person entering with a gun. Of course, this can also work with our fever detection platform. And if a person has the fever walking in front of the camera, it'll send the same exact alert.  Jennifer: Fever detection technology took off during covid, and though it’s far from foolproof… it’s probably here to stay. Instructor: So what you see here is a person entering with a weapon. Soon as the camera sees the weapon on the lower left hand corner.. wait for it.. There it is. Boom. It shows the alert on the right hand side, it pops into Avigilon. You'll see the image and then you can pull open the video if you like.  Jennifer: After the Parkland shooting, Reporter Mark Keierleber says he was getting all kinds of pitches from tech companies about everything from metal detectors to those bulletproof backpacks… and he says someone from Athena reached out with a quote that really stayed with him. Mark Keierleber: Well, I'm gonna read you the quote. // Artificial intelligence to help law enforcement stop crime before it starts or escalates, like Minority Report but in real life, is becoming a reality. // And that's pretty interesting. Right. Um, so if you've ever seen the movie Minority Report, the idea here is that, in Minority Report, you're, you're being constantly followed by different forms of surveillance. It's able to recognize, um, everything around you and basically predict crime before it happens.  Announcer: [00:21] Within just one month under the pre-crime program, the murder rate in the District of Columbia was reduced 90 percent.  Victim 1: They were gonna be waiting for me in the car.   Victim 2: He was gonna rape me. Victim 3: I was going to be stabbed. Victim 4: Right here.  Announcer: Within a year, pre-crime effectively stopped murder in our nation's capital.  Jennifer: Up until recently, security cameras have been passive. Meaning, after a crime, people watch the tape to see what happened. But we’re moving to a world where cameras are active… with AI that makes real time assessments and predictions. Mark Keierleber: Certainly there are all kinds of other forms of weapons detection on the market. I mean, Shot Spotter is a big one and it exists in communities across the United States, especially major cities.  Jennifer: Basically, that product is a microphone on a light pole that’s meant to detect the sound of a gunshot.  Then, there’s products like Evolv. Mark Keierleber: It's these new forms of high tech, what appear to be basically metal detectors… and metal detectors play a role in the school security conversation. They certainly are discussed a lot at length in the wake of school shootings. We saw major growth in different forms of security and surveillance technology installed in schools, in the wake of the Columbine shooting and in the wake of Parkland and in the wake of Sandy Hook tragedy. And certainly nothing is going to be different with Uvalde.   [Chapter Change Music]  Mike Ellenbogen: Metal detectors are 90 years old, nine zero, right? They were first deployed in Germany in the 1920s, 1930s to look for castings being stolen out of factories. And they haven't fundamentally changed. And they were great for, you know, if, if you want, in a prison environment, if you've gotta make sure that nobody's coming in with a handcuff key or half a razor blade or something like that  Mike Ellenbogen: Sure. Uh, Mike Ellenbogen. Founder, and chief innovation officer for Evolv Technologies.   In an environment where you don't expect them to have any other metal objects on them, metal detectors are great. They're really good at finding metal. The problem is today, we're all carrying metal, right? Everybody's got a cell phone, everybody's got pockets full of stuff.  Jennifer: His goal is to automatically detect threats being carried by people. Mike Ellenbogen: I've grown up if you will, in doing physical security technology. So Evolv’s actually my third company in this space. My last company was called Reveal Imaging Technologies. We made the systems that TSA uses in about 250 airports around the US to automatically look for explosives in suitcases before they get loaded into the belly of the aircraft.  Jennifer: And after that company was acquired… he was looking for his next project. Mike Ellenbogen: And that's when the Sandy Hook shooting happened. So it was obvious at that point in time that what the world really needed was an answer to this active shooter problem.  How do we keep threats like guns, bombs, you know, large threats to the crowd, tactical knives, things like that, out of venues that just want to create a safe environment. How do we enable security professionals to create a safe environment, but recognize that they still need to move a lot of people in and out quickly? So we set up Evolv to do exactly that. That's why we exist. Jennifer: He says the system uses a combination of sensors and machine learning to discern between everyday items and those that pose a threat. Mike Ellenbogen: So rather than that old school analog metal detector, the Evolv system's a digital platform at your front door. It's got the core weapons detection capability, but there's also cameras that we can use for different applications. The other sensors that we can add and other capabilities that we can provide, including the data that come from all that, that helps the venue optimize their operations. Jennifer: And he says they’re working on ways to integrate it with other systems.  Mike Ellenbogen:  We think there's a great opportunity to combine credentialing. So ticketing is a form of credentialing, right? An ID, you know, that it takes to get into your building is credentialing. So bringing those two things together using, whether it's face based recognition, maybe phone based. There’s a number of different ways in which we can do that. We spend a lot of time trying to understand the lay of the land and figure out which of the best, either, technologies that are either existing or that we might want to develop to address some of these needs. [music] Jennifer: You can find links to our reporting in the show notes... and you can support our journalism by going to tech review dot com, slash subscribe. We’ll be back… right after this. [MIDROLL]  Donald Maye: Certainly with a product like Evolv, you know, they've raised hundreds of millions of dollars with aspirations to be part of everyday life in the United States and the world. And, you know, that is lofty expectations and we felt and feel that the public should really understand what this technology can and cannot do.  I'm Donald Maye. I'm the head of operations of IPVM and IPVM is an organization that specializes in reporting on the video surveillance and security industry.  We're a team of researchers and reporters that really try to understand the underlying technology that's being sold in the marketplace. And really what we try to do is be an objective resource that isn't influenced by the companies or the sellers of this technology. Jennifer: His team spent eight months trying to study how Evolv’s systems work. Donald Maye: What stands out is they bill themselves as a weapons detector and, and they go so far as to say on their website what they're not, and what they're not is a metal detector. And like, for us, that's wildly deceptive because when you look at the underlying technology, it is in fact a metal detector. One that's able to better distinguish between certain metal objects and make a determination of whether something is benign or an actual object of threat. Jennifer: But his tests found that strollers, umbrellas and eyeglass cases were often mislabeled as weapons.  Donald Maye: What each of these items have as a challenge for the Evolv system to differentiate between those in a weapon is that they have properties that are similar to weapons and so the Evolv technology struggles to differentiate between those two. If you have a high volume area, you know, where thousands of people are walking through in an hour, you're gonna have many, many, many secondary alerts, particularly in environments where it's not expected for people to not be carrying metal objects and an environment like that would be the subway. You know, people, especially in New York City, take all kinds of metal objects onto the subway, which is much different than, say, going to a sports venue or going to a museum. Subways have people going about their day to day lives and so you can think very clearly now if you, if you understand this underlying limitation of the system, that it's gonna be a challenge logistically to deploy it in all the places that Evolv is seeking to deploy it. Jennifer: It also presents a problem for schools where Evolv systems are already deployed. Because school-issued laptops are another common culprit of those false positives. Donald Maye: There's metal hinges in certain Chromebooks that have properties similar to a gun. There's some cylinder shaped componentry to it and it's curved and looks like the outline of a gun.  Jennifer: And while he says Evolv’s systems have something of an internal workaround for that detection issue… it comes with key tradeoffs.  Donald Maye: One of the more enlightening pieces of information that we learned was from a school board meeting where an Evolv employee was describing the trade off of settings as it relates to Chromebooks and guns. And what he stated was, he goes, if you go on setting C, which is a lower sensitivity setting, he goes, you won't alert on Chromebooks. However, you might miss certain guns. Then he says it's a difficult give and take. And he specifically noted subcompact handguns. And so for me, I heard it. I go, well, that's, that is a difficult give and take. If you're a school you're having to decide whether or not I wanna do the work around where, where I'm asking people and students to hold up their Chromebook or go to a lower sensitivity setting and run the risk of someone, you know, not alerting on a gun. Jennifer: And Donald Maye says it’s not clear what variables the algorithm weighs when that sensitivity is adjusted. And this decision between efficiency and accuracy… one with potentially devastating consequences… is left up to the people using the device, which in this case, might fall to a mix of volunteers from the teaching staff.  Donald Maye: Being presented information and not having the ability to reliably dissect it and understand it. And I think that disconnect in information creates an imbalance of power between the buyers and end users and the people who are selling it. And that can lead to a lot of problems.  Jennifer: And what he’s describing… extends well beyond this topic… because the world is becoming ever more technical, and with it, that information imbalance just keeps on getting wider.      It’s a bit like looking under the hood of a car. In the past drivers could understand the basic mechanics of how it all worked. Not so much anymore. And back to that laptop problem… making the system less sensitive could miss some weapons… but on the other hand, alarms going off all day are likely to be ignored.  Mike Ellenbogen: Yeah. It's a, it's a real challenge within the security domain, right? Whether it's physical or cyber, you know, we call it alert fatigue.  Jennifer: Mike Ellenbogen… is the cofounder of Evolv Mike Ellenbogen: If you remember, when car alarms were first introduced, right? If a car alarm went off, you know, in the street, outside your apartment, you know, you'd run to the window to see what's going on. And then they just became annoying and you would ignore them because they were happening all the time. And then people kind of just turned them off. And that's what happens with a lot of these technologies that aren't quite ready for primetime. That those false alarms create. That they undermine people's faith in the technology. And then it just becomes a nuisance.

We spend a lot of time trying to understand the lay of the land and figure out which of the best, either, technologies that are either existing or that we might want to develop to address some of these needs. [music] Jennifer: You can find links to our reporting in the show notes... and you can support our journalism by going to tech review dot com, slash subscribe. We’ll be back… right after this. [MIDROLL] Donald Maye: Certainly with a product like Evolv, you know, they've raised hundreds of millions of dollars with aspirations to be part of everyday life in the United States and the world. And, you know, that is lofty expectations and we felt and feel that the public should really understand what this technology can and cannot do. I'm Donald Maye. I'm the head of operations of IPVM and IPVM is an organization that specializes in reporting on the video surveillance and security industry. We're a team of researchers and reporters that really try to understand the underlying technology that's being sold in the marketplace. And really what we try to do is be an objective resource that isn't influenced by the companies or the sellers of this technology. Jennifer: His team spent eight months trying to study how Evolv’s systems work. Donald Maye: What stands out is they bill themselves as a weapons detector and, and they go so far as to say on their website what they're not, and what they're not is a metal detector. And like, for us, that's wildly deceptive because when you look at the underlying technology, it is in fact a metal detector. One that's able to better distinguish between certain metal objects and make a determination of whether something is benign or an actual object of threat. Jennifer: But his tests found that strollers, umbrellas and eyeglass cases were often mislabeled as weapons. Donald Maye: What each of these items have as a challenge for the Evolv system to differentiate between those in a weapon is that they have properties that are similar to weapons and so the Evolv technology struggles to differentiate between those two. If you have a high volume area, you know, where thousands of people are walking through in an hour, you're gonna have many, many, many secondary alerts, particularly in environments where it's not expected for people to not be carrying metal objects and an environment like that would be the subway. You know, people, especially in New York City, take all kinds of metal objects onto the subway, which is much different than, say, going to a sports venue or going to a museum. Subways have people going about their day to day lives and so you can think very clearly now if you, if you understand this underlying limitation of the system, that it's gonna be a challenge logistically to deploy it in all the places that Evolv is seeking to deploy it. Jennifer: It also presents a problem for schools where Evolv systems are already deployed. Because school-issued laptops are another common culprit of those false positives. Donald Maye: There's metal hinges in certain Chromebooks that have properties similar to a gun. There's some cylinder shaped componentry to it and it's curved and looks like the outline of a gun. Jennifer: And while he says Evolv’s systems have something of an internal workaround for that detection issue… it comes with key tradeoffs. Donald Maye: One of the more enlightening pieces of information that we learned was from a school board meeting where an Evolv employee was describing the trade off of settings as it relates to Chromebooks and guns. And what he stated was, he goes, if you go on setting C, which is a lower sensitivity setting, he goes, you won't alert on Chromebooks. However, you might miss certain guns. Then he says it's a difficult give and take. And he specifically noted subcompact handguns. And so for me, I heard it. I go, well, that's, that is a difficult give and take. If you're a school you're having to decide whether or not I wanna do the work around where, where I'm asking people and students to hold up their Chromebook or go to a lower sensitivity setting and run the risk of someone, you know, not alerting on a gun. Jennifer: And Donald Maye says it’s not clear what variables the algorithm weighs when that sensitivity is adjusted. And this decision between efficiency and accuracy… one with potentially devastating consequences… is left up to the people using the device, which in this case, might fall to a mix of volunteers from the teaching staff. Donald Maye: Being presented information and not having the ability to reliably dissect it and understand it. And I think that disconnect in information creates an imbalance of power between the buyers and end users and the people who are selling it. And that can lead to a lot of problems. Jennifer: And what he’s describing… extends well beyond this topic… because the world is becoming ever more technical, and with it, that information imbalance just keeps on getting wider. It’s a bit like looking under the hood of a car. In the past drivers could understand the basic mechanics of how it all worked. Not so much anymore. And back to that laptop problem… making the system less sensitive could miss some weapons… but on the other hand, alarms going off all day are likely to be ignored. Mike Ellenbogen: Yeah. It's a, it's a real challenge within the security domain, right? Whether it's physical or cyber, you know, we call it alert fatigue. Jennifer: Mike Ellenbogen… is the cofounder of Evolv Mike Ellenbogen: If you remember, when car alarms were first introduced, right? If a car alarm went off, you know, in the street, outside your apartment, you know, you'd run to the window to see what's going on. And then they just became annoying and you would ignore them because they were happening all the time. And then people kind of just turned them off. And that's what happens with a lot of these technologies that aren't quite ready for primetime. That those false alarms create. That they undermine people's faith in the technology. And then it just becomes a nuisance. [CREDITS] Jennifer: This episode was produced by Anthony Green and Emma Cillekens with reporting from Mark Keierleber.

But the event also stood out for a different reason—one that only eagle-eyed fans might have noticed. The singer in the video was not Gong himself, but a digital replica created by Baidu, a “digital human” powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Likewise, the lyrics and melody were generated by AI, marking the recording as China’s first AI-generated content music video. Deloitte defines digital humans as AI-powered virtual beings that can produce a whole range of human body language. In recent years, businesses focused on providing round-the-clock services, as well as the media and entertainment industry, are increasingly adopting this nascent technology, aiming to capture a growing market. And as digital humans increasingly populate other sectors like retail, health care, and finance, Emergen Research forecasts that the global market for digital humans will jump to about $530 billion in 2030, from $10 billion in 2020.  “Rising demand is driving the boom of digital humans,” says Shiyan Li, head of the digital human and robotics business at Baidu, which created the digital model-actor, Gong. “In China alone, there are over 400 million ACGN (animation, comics, games, and novel) fans, and an enterprise market worth hundreds of billions of dollars centered on digital humans.” And according to a company that tracks business registrations, Qichacha, China now has more than 280,000 enterprises that engage in digital human-related activities. The debut of Baidu’s digital celebrity may not seem like much at first, as the concept of “virtual idols” has been around for years. For example, US virtual influencer Lil Miquela has been appearing alongside real human celebrities in online advertisements and TV commercials since 2016, gaining over three million Instagram followers. However, there is something different about the virtual Chinese star: a digital human with the ability to listen, speak, and interact with real humans at a level never seen before. And Gong’s digital duties are not limited to singing. On the latest update of Baidu App, China’s leading search-plus-feed app, Gong appears on users’ phones, helping with searches and queries using the model-actor’s real voice. Since this interactive search experience was launched in 2021, it has boosted the number of voice search queries on Baidu App by 18.2%. Baidu AI Cloud first began developing a digital employee in 2019 in collaboration with Shanghai Pudong Development (SPD) Bank. Subsequently, they focused their efforts on building a digital financial advisor to provide a service equivalent to that of a human bank representative when real-life employees were unavailable. Today, SPD Bank says more than 460,000 customers rely on digital humans for banking services and portfolio management each month. “Access to digital humans outside of regular business hours allows SPD Bank to offer 24/7 customer service at low cost and high efficiency,” says a bank representative. More recently, a Baidu-created virtual anchor provided live commentary in sign language at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games for hearing-impaired viewers. In addition to looking like a real person, the avatar was empowered with speech recognition and sign-language interpretation abilities to ensure rapid and highly accurate input and output. With approximately 430 million people around the world experiencing “disabling” hearing loss, according to the World Health Organization, there is strong potential for this technology to be used to increase their ability to access a wide range of content. From entertainment to public services, digital humans are set to play a greater role in our daily lives. But behind their natural and effortless appearance is a complex web of new and emerging technologies pushing the boundaries of AI innovation. Baidu AI Cloud’s digital celebrity and virtual sign-language anchors were created through XiLing, a new digital platform launched in 2021. At the Baidu World 2022 event held on July 21, the company announced a new capability on XiLing, which supports the creation of digital humans that can be livestream hosts who can sing, dance, and respond to comments in real-time—without ever needing a single break. XiLing is unique in its ability to support the entire process of creating a digital human from crafting a realistic persona to endowing it with conversational and content-generation skills. One of its most striking attributes is speed. The platform can generate a 3D avatar based on a real person in one to two weeks, while a 2D avatar can be made in just a matter of minutes.  In addition, using XiLing’s intelligent dialogue tools, creators can quickly customize a digital human’s conversational ability, letting it adapt and learn over time. This capability is powered by Baidu’s PLATO, a hundred-billion-parameter dialogue model that enables digital humans to participate in open-domain conversations—that is, to understand any topic and provide relevant responses. Highly accurate speech recognition and lip-syncing with above-98.5% accuracy allows the digital human to have smoother, more human-like interactions. “Use of advanced AI technologies will keep bringing down the cost of building digital humans and significantly improve their interactions with real humans,” says Li. Just as every real human has their own set of skills and talents, so too does the new generation of digital humans. This can even include giving digital humans the ability to be creative themselves, thanks to the recent progress made by large AI models like Baidu’s ERNIE, which can generate texts and create realistic images when prompted. Digital humans designed to serve as brand spokespersons, for example, can independently create and post on social media, design posters, and perform in videos. Digital humans and their virtual world do not merely represent reproductions of real humans and our physical world, but they could also create an entirely new medium of expression in next-generation social media worlds. “Web3 and the metaverse have sparked a wave of speculations in the tech field today about what the future may bring,” says Li. “A digital replica of self will be core to the metaverse. Digital people for customer service will continue to serve the metaverse with a better experience than a pure graphic interface.”  Yanxia Lu, assistant research director at IDC China, says that the benefits are already clear. ""Digital humans are already demonstrating clear business value in numerous fields today,” says Lu. “In the future, there will definitely be a large team of digital humans coexisting side-by-side with us in life and work.""  In other words, virtual financial advisors and avatar translators are just the beginning. Today, digital humans with the capability to adapt and learn are already poised to dramatically expand access to essential services and more. As society transitions to a more digital world, digital humans are set to play a key role in accompanying us on this journey.  This content was produced by Baidu.

For example, US virtual influencer Lil Miquela has been appearing alongside real human celebrities in online advertisements and TV commercials since 2016, gaining over three million Instagram followers. However, there is something different about the virtual Chinese star: a digital human with the ability to listen, speak, and interact with real humans at a level never seen before. And Gong’s digital duties are not limited to singing. On the latest update of Baidu App, China’s leading search-plus-feed app, Gong appears on users’ phones, helping with searches and queries using the model-actor’s real voice. Since this interactive search experience was launched in 2021, it has boosted the number of voice search queries on Baidu App by 18.2%. Baidu AI Cloud first began developing a digital employee in 2019 in collaboration with Shanghai Pudong Development (SPD) Bank. Subsequently, they focused their efforts on building a digital financial advisor to provide a service equivalent to that of a human bank representative when real-life employees were unavailable. Today, SPD Bank says more than 460,000 customers rely on digital humans for banking services and portfolio management each month. “Access to digital humans outside of regular business hours allows SPD Bank to offer 24/7 customer service at low cost and high efficiency,” says a bank representative. More recently, a Baidu-created virtual anchor provided live commentary in sign language at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games for hearing-impaired viewers. In addition to looking like a real person, the avatar was empowered with speech recognition and sign-language interpretation abilities to ensure rapid and highly accurate input and output. With approximately 430 million people around the world experiencing “disabling” hearing loss, according to the World Health Organization, there is strong potential for this technology to be used to increase their ability to access a wide range of content. From entertainment to public services, digital humans are set to play a greater role in our daily lives. But behind their natural and effortless appearance is a complex web of new and emerging technologies pushing the boundaries of AI innovation. Baidu AI Cloud’s digital celebrity and virtual sign-language anchors were created through XiLing, a new digital platform launched in 2021. At the Baidu World 2022 event held on July 21, the company announced a new capability on XiLing, which supports the creation of digital humans that can be livestream hosts who can sing, dance, and respond to comments in real-time—without ever needing a single break. XiLing is unique in its ability to support the entire process of creating a digital human from crafting a realistic persona to endowing it with conversational and content-generation skills. One of its most striking attributes is speed. The platform can generate a 3D avatar based on a real person in one to two weeks, while a 2D avatar can be made in just a matter of minutes. In addition, using XiLing’s intelligent dialogue tools, creators can quickly customize a digital human’s conversational ability, letting it adapt and learn over time. This capability is powered by Baidu’s PLATO, a hundred-billion-parameter dialogue model that enables digital humans to participate in open-domain conversations—that is, to understand any topic and provide relevant responses. Highly accurate speech recognition and lip-syncing with above-98.5% accuracy allows the digital human to have smoother, more human-like interactions. “Use of advanced AI technologies will keep bringing down the cost of building digital humans and significantly improve their interactions with real humans,” says Li. Just as every real human has their own set of skills and talents, so too does the new generation of digital humans. This can even include giving digital humans the ability to be creative themselves, thanks to the recent progress made by large AI models like Baidu’s ERNIE, which can generate texts and create realistic images when prompted. Digital humans designed to serve as brand spokespersons, for example, can independently create and post on social media, design posters, and perform in videos. Digital humans and their virtual world do not merely represent reproductions of real humans and our physical world, but they could also create an entirely new medium of expression in next-generation social media worlds. “Web3 and the metaverse have sparked a wave of speculations in the tech field today about what the future may bring,” says Li. “A digital replica of self will be core to the metaverse. Digital people for customer service will continue to serve the metaverse with a better experience than a pure graphic interface.” Yanxia Lu, assistant research director at IDC China, says that the benefits are already clear. ""Digital humans are already demonstrating clear business value in numerous fields today,” says Lu. “In the future, there will definitely be a large team of digital humans coexisting side-by-side with us in life and work."" In other words, virtual financial advisors and avatar translators are just the beginning. Today, digital humans with the capability to adapt and learn are already poised to dramatically expand access to essential services and more. As society transitions to a more digital world, digital humans are set to play a key role in accompanying us on this journey. This content was produced by Baidu.

An edit button won’t fix Twitter’s problems,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/01/1058931/edit-button-fix-twitter-problems/,2022-09-01,"<p>Twitter’s users have asked for an edit button for years. Giving them one isn’t going to change their behavior for the better.</p>
","After years of requests, Twitter is finally introducing an edit button, giving its users the ability to change their tweets up to 30 minutes after they’ve been sent. But the feature is unlikely to solve any of the biggest problems facing the company—and in some cases, it could worsen them. The feature will initially be restricted to Twitter staff for testing, before rolling out to subscribers to Twitter’s $5 monthly subscription service Blue later this month. Given that Twitter Blue is a test bed for the company’s new features, it’s highly likely that an edit button will be eventually made available for all users. Twitter has resisted adding the ability to edit tweets for years, even though this has been the most requested feature from its users, including would-be owner Elon Musk. Former chief executive Jack Dorsey said in 2020 that the company would probably never introduce an edit button, explaining that doing so would ruin the “vibe” from Twitter’s early days as an SMS messaging service.  Experts have repeatedly pointed out that the ability to edit tweets could allow bad actors to rewrite history and spread misinformation, even if a full history of tweets is available.  For example, harmless tweets that go viral could easily be edited to later display disinformation or hate speech, and even if the tweet’s previous versions are visible, that doesn’t necessarily mean people will look at them. An edit button would also, in theory, make high-profile users whose tweets garner mass attention even bigger targets for hacking, if bad actors know the tweets are guaranteed a mass audience.     Users will be alerted to the fact that tweets have been edited by an icon, time stamp, and label, which Twitter said is designed to make it clear that the original message has been modified within half an hour of being sent. Tweets can be edited “a few times” within that time frame, and a log of how a tweet has been changed will be displayed when someone taps the label. ""Our goal with testing is to better understand how Edited Tweets will impact the way people use Twitter as well as plan for and anticipate what might happen if we bring it to everyone,"" a Twitter spokesperson said. The company has acknowledged that people might misuse the feature and says it is testing for that potential. It’s likely an attempt to downplay the significance, says Konstantinos Komaitis, an internet policy expert. “Depending on how Twitter decides to design this, it can either help people with typos and there’s nothing more to it, or it can actually shift, I believe, the whole public discourse and the way we interact and share an understanding,” he says. Giving users an edit button could also be interpreted as a handy distraction from the deeper problems the platform is dealing with: its forthcoming legal tussle with Musk, the glaring privacy and security issues laid bare by former security head turned whistleblower Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, and ongoing concerns about its deep-seated inability to curb trolling, hate speech, and other toxic behaviors. An edit button does nothing to solve these issues.  Notifying users that a tweet has been edited will be essential to minimizing the possibility for abuse, Komaitis pointed out, using the example of someone tweeting a picture of a cute dog to generate positive responses and then swapping it for a picture of Hitler. “We know these situations can happen, and it’s not because of Twitter or the internet, but because that’s how society currently functions,” he said, adding that the potential benefits of an edit button are unlikely to outweigh the possibilities for abuse.  “Twitter needs to come up with as many safeguards as possible in order to ensure that it is purely for small mistakes, or a regrettable choice of words, rather than completely changing the way the conversations are taking place.” By limiting the feature to paying subscribers at least for now, Twitter could dramatically shrink, although not fully eradicate, the pool of users who are likely to use it maliciously.  But it also raises questions over whether an edited tweet will count as a real tweet. This could warp the number of daily active users. And it’s also debatable whether using paying subscribers to test the feature is really equivalent to handing it over to the platform’s most toxic user base.  Ultimately, the popularity of the idea of an edit button speaks to our perfectionism, says Charles Arthur, author of Social Warming: How Social Media Polarizes Us All.  “We seem bizarrely desirous of this ability to edit our lives—of using technologies to roll back time, which points to a sort of societal anxiety of ‘Oh no, did I say the wrong thing?’” he says.   “We don’t have the confidence in what we’ve said, even if we’ve got it a bit wrong. The trouble is, anything that can be used maliciously will be used maliciously, and Twitter is the absolute hotbed of people doing malicious things.” Update: a response from a Twitter spokesperson has been added.

That was 30 years ago, on a 1G network—at a data rate about fifteen thousand times slower than today. Now the 6G program manager at Keysight Technologies, Nichols sees the rapid growth of the current mobile wireless standard and knows that there is much more to come. As of June 2022, the Global Mobile Suppliers Association counted nearly 500 operators in 145 countries that had deployed—or planned to deploy—5G capabilities, up from 412 at the end of 2020. Omdia and 5G Americas project that by the end of 2022, more than 1.3 billion connections will be made to global 5G networks. “The intervening decades have seen an explosion in the use of wireless data connections,” he says. “5G systems will not only help with increasing demands for speed, latency, and reliability, but also with the flexibility required to make the most of the costly resources of modern networks: spectrum and energy.” But 5G is just the current stage in the evolution of mobile wireless networks. Today’s dramatic growth in 5G availability is the continuation of a march toward advanced wireless capabilities, one that began more than four decades ago when Japan’s NTT deployed the first automated mobile network. And even while this current generation of wireless connectivity is deployed, engineers and technologists are aiming to push the technology into its next generation, 6G. It’s clear that tomorrow’s innovative applications will require still better connectivity. Augmented reality will allow workers to enhance their surroundings with detailed information or will connect consumers through virtual worlds. Networked devices that collect data from physical objects—from airplanes to tires to infrastructure—promise to deliver more intelligence to management systems. Connected vehicles will communicate with one another, improving driving efficiency and safety. “How 6G will be used is speculative,” Nichols says; however, “the list of 6G use cases varies from ‘5G-on-steroids’ to what looks like science fiction.” To create 6G infrastructure, devices, and software, however, engineers and researchers will have to solve a plethora of problems. Aiming to improve mobile wireless connectivity by an order of magnitude presents challenges that can’t be addressed by merely scaling existing technology. These include mastering the physics of high-frequency signals, managing space requirements within devices for multiple wireless chips and hardware, and developing the software needed to automate the management of distributed and programmable networks. The coming 6G systems will add additional non-contiguous spectrum to an already complex spectrum map. They will also bring more sophisticated active-antenna systems, further integration into networks using other Radio Access Technologies (such as WLAN, Bluetooth, UWB, and Satellite), and joint communications and sensing technology. Integrating all of this into a single device, such as a smartphone, will demand a huge and complex variety of radio transceiver technology. This will require very creative electrical and computer engineering as well was disruptive industrial engineering and power management. Computing power and data storage will be ever increasing challenges for the new high-speed and programmable communication networks. To accommodate exponentially growing populations of devices that need to access the 6G network, new chips will need to process signals more quickly, requiring more power and faster storage. Managing the sensors required to create detailed digital twins—simulations based on the collection of real-world data—also requires a great deal more processing power and fast storage space than is available on current networks. Providing low latency (minimal delay) is already a familiar challenge for mobile networks, and one that will continue as next-generation applications increasingly allow interactive manipulation of data, responsive virtual environments, or real-time monitoring and management of remote systems. New 6G applications will layer on a need for extremely precise timing—absolute predictability of when data packets will be sent or received. Addressing these physical and technical limitations will require leaps of innovation, but the promise of applications powered by advanced 6G connectivity is motivating creative solutions. Adaptive technology solutions are a key area of research. Rather than focus on optimizing the bandwidth for a single device, for example, the 6G network will use nearby devices to help deliver the necessary bandwidth and reduce latency. This 3D signal shaping focuses on combining and processing wireless signals from multiple sources, based on their proximity to the end user. New semiconductor materials will help manage device space requirements as well as handle wider frequency bands. Though it requires complex engineering, one promising approach combines traditional silicon circuits with those made from more exotic compound semiconductors, such as indium phosphide. In addition, researchers are looking at ways of changing the environment with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (“smart surfaces”) that can optimize signal propagation to modify signals in real time to deliver better bandwidth and lower latency. Another avenue of research relies on artificial intelligence to manage networks and optimize communications. Different types of network usage (texting, gaming, and streaming, for example) create different types of network demand. AI solutions enable a system to predict this demand based on behavioral patterns, instead of requiring engineers to always design for the highest demand levels. Nichols sees great potential for networks from improvements in artificial intelligence. “Today’s systems are so complex, with so many levers to pull to address the diverse demands,” says Nichols, “that most decisions on optimizing are limited to first-order adjustments like more sites, updated radios, better backhaul, more efficient data gateways, and throttling certain users.” By contrast, employing artificial intelligence to handle the optimization, he says, presents “a significant opportunity for a move to autonomous, self-optimized, and self-organized networks.” Virtual simulations and digital-twin technology are promising tools that will not only will assist in 6G innovation but will be further enabled by 6G once established. These emerging technologies can help companies test their products and systems in a sandbox that simulates real-world conditions, allowing equipment makers and application developers to test concepts in complex environments and create early product prototypes for 6G networks. While engineers and researchers have proposed innovative solutions, Nichols notes that building 6G networks will also require consensus between technology providers, operators, and carriers. While the rollout of 5G networks continues, industry players should create a cohesive vision for what applications the next-generation network will support and how their technologies will work together. It is this collaboration and complexity, however, that may generate the most exciting and enduring outcomes. Nichols notes that the breadth of engineering specialties required to build 6G, and the industry collaboration necessary to launch it, will drive exciting cross-disciplinary innovation. Because of the resulting demand for new solutions, the path to 6G will be paved, in Nichols’ words, with “a tremendous amount of technical research, development, and innovation from electronics to semiconductors to antennas to radio network systems to internet protocols to artificial intelligence to cybersecurity.” This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

","In association withKeysight Roger Nichols remembers sending his first e-mail using wireless networks in the early 1990s, from the back of a bus during his daily commute. That was 30 years ago, on a 1G network—at a data rate about fifteen thousand times slower than today. Now the 6G program manager at Keysight Technologies, Nichols sees the rapid growth of the current mobile wireless standard and knows that there is much more to come. As of June 2022, the Global Mobile Suppliers Association counted nearly 500 operators in 145 countries that had deployed—or planned to deploy—5G capabilities, up from 412 at the end of 2020. Omdia and 5G Americas project that by the end of 2022, more than 1.3 billion connections will be made to global 5G networks. “The intervening decades have seen an explosion in the use of wireless data connections,” he says. “5G systems will not only help with increasing demands for speed, latency, and reliability, but also with the flexibility required to make the most of the costly resources of modern networks: spectrum and energy.” But 5G is just the current stage in the evolution of mobile wireless networks. Today’s dramatic growth in 5G availability is the continuation of a march toward advanced wireless capabilities, one that began more than four decades ago when Japan’s NTT deployed the first automated mobile network. And even while this current generation of wireless connectivity is deployed, engineers and technologists are aiming to push the technology into its next generation, 6G. It’s clear that tomorrow’s innovative applications will require still better connectivity. Augmented reality will allow workers to enhance their surroundings with detailed information or will connect consumers through virtual worlds. Networked devices that collect data from physical objects—from airplanes to tires to infrastructure—promise to deliver more intelligence to management systems. Connected vehicles will communicate with one another, improving driving efficiency and safety. “How 6G will be used is speculative,” Nichols says; however, “the list of 6G use cases varies from ‘5G-on-steroids’ to what looks like science fiction.” To create 6G infrastructure, devices, and software, however, engineers and researchers will have to solve a plethora of problems. Aiming to improve mobile wireless connectivity by an order of magnitude presents challenges that can’t be addressed by merely scaling existing technology. These include mastering the physics of high-frequency signals, managing space requirements within devices for multiple wireless chips and hardware, and developing the software needed to automate the management of distributed and programmable networks. The coming 6G systems will add additional non-contiguous spectrum to an already complex spectrum map. They will also bring more sophisticated active-antenna systems, further integration into networks using other Radio Access Technologies (such as WLAN, Bluetooth, UWB, and Satellite), and joint communications and sensing technology. Integrating all of this into a single device, such as a smartphone, will demand a huge and complex variety of radio transceiver technology. This will require very creative electrical and computer engineering as well was disruptive industrial engineering and power management. Computing power and data storage will be ever increasing challenges for the new high-speed and programmable communication networks. To accommodate exponentially growing populations of devices that need to access the 6G network, new chips will need to process signals more quickly, requiring more power and faster storage. Managing the sensors required to create detailed digital twins—simulations based on the collection of real-world data—also requires a great deal more processing power and fast storage space than is available on current networks. Providing low latency (minimal delay) is already a familiar challenge for mobile networks, and one that will continue as next-generation applications increasingly allow interactive manipulation of data, responsive virtual environments, or real-time monitoring and management of remote systems. New 6G applications will layer on a need for extremely precise timing—absolute predictability of when data packets will be sent or received. Addressing these physical and technical limitations will require leaps of innovation, but the promise of applications powered by advanced 6G connectivity is motivating creative solutions. Adaptive technology solutions are a key area of research. Rather than focus on optimizing the bandwidth for a single device, for example, the 6G network will use nearby devices to help deliver the necessary bandwidth and reduce latency. This 3D signal shaping focuses on combining and processing wireless signals from multiple sources, based on their proximity to the end user. New semiconductor materials will help manage device space requirements as well as handle wider frequency bands. Though it requires complex engineering, one promising approach combines traditional silicon circuits with those made from more exotic compound semiconductors, such as indium phosphide. In addition, researchers are looking at ways of changing the environment with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (“smart surfaces”) that can optimize signal propagation to modify signals in real time to deliver better bandwidth and lower latency.

Meet the designer behind gender-neutral emoji,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/23/1057142/gender-neutral-emoji-designer/,2022-08-23,"<p>Paul D. Hunt pushed the Unicode Consortium away from stereotypical gender iconography.</p>
","Last year the Unicode Consortium—the group responsible for the selection and design of emoji—released a new series that reflected the multiplicity of gender identities. That’s thanks to Paul D. Hunt, who since 2016 has been a key advocate for making emoji more inclusive, less sexist, and a better reflection of the human experience.  Fighting to dismantle the gender stereotypes we see in emoji may seem unimportant. But consider that since their invention in 1999 by Shigetaka Kurita, emoji have expanded from 176 simple, pixelated icons to (as of September 2021) 3,633 increasingly detailed images. Every day, more and more people around the world have access to mobile phones and to emoji that add expressiveness to their text-based communications. The fight for gender inclusivity in emoji is personal for Hunt, who is nonbinary and transgender. Hunt is also a trained typographer and designer rooted in linguistics and art. There may be no better person on the planet to think about what it means to produce and consume emoji that reflect the multiplicity of gender identities. Hunt’s interest in “language and alphabets and design and culture” was rooted in their small-town childhood in a Mormon community embedded within the Navajo Nation in Arizona. They went to college intending to study for an international business degree but switched to design. Hunt was active in an online community of typographers, Typophile, while interning at a type foundry in Buffalo, New York, and spent time drawing letters and designing fonts before earning a master’s in typeface design at the University of Reading in the UK and becoming a leading typeface designer at Adobe, specializing in fonts that don’t use the Latin alphabet. But it is their participation in the emoji subcommittee of the Unicode Consortium that has garnered Hunt the most acclaim. And their thinking on gender and emoji had a surprising source: RuPaul’s Drag Race. At first, Hunt rolled their eyes at the flamboyance of the Drag Race contestants. “I used to think RuPaul was too camp, and I didn’t really understand this whole drag queen phenomenon,” they say. But Hunt’s husband was a fan, so Hunt began watching the show and was increasingly drawn into it, moved by the contestants’ refusal to fall into conventional gender roles and stereotypes. This led to an epiphany: gender was a performance. Every day we make choices “to skew our appearance one way or another, whether that’s masculine or feminine,” they explain, “and it made me ask what it means to be masculine or feminine.” As the new head of the Emoji Subcommittee for the Unicode Consortium, Jennifer Daniel has a vision for how to make these symbols work for everyone. Emoji tended to codify gender with traditional signs of masculinity (beard, mustache, short hair) and femininity (painted nails, longer hair, skirts). Hunt found this limiting, even disturbing: Why was a nurse a woman and a police officer a man? Why were “frivolous” activities like getting your nails painted or dancing depicted as feminine, while “serious” activities like construction were always depicted as masculine? Why were these images so staunchly gendered anyway? Hunt decided to do something about this. They were already part of the Emoji Subcommittee, a group of designers and industry experts within the nonprofit Unicode Consortium, which works with hardware and software companies to make emoji readable and universal across all devices. So in 2016, Hunt submitted a proposal to push for gender-inclusive emoji, which they defined as “a humanized appearance that employs visual cues that are common to all genders by excluding stereotypes that are either explicitly masculine or feminine.” It was revolutionary. To many, emoji were cutesy, simplistic additions to text, not humanistic and certainly not political. Hunt acknowledges as much, diplomatically saying there was a bit of skepticism from those running the committee. Some designers pointed to Google, which had tried to skirt gender and race with its yellow blobs in Gchat. On some level this worked, but Hunt found the accommodation a bit odd: Why couldn’t emoji express more of the nuances of human experience without resorting to abstraction? Hunt’s proposal found an audience in Jennifer Daniel, who now leads the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee and has been instrumental in redefining the linguistics of emoji by ushering in an era that celebrates inclusivity and creative use of the symbols as a means of expression.  Daniel told me that when she joined the subcommittee, in 2018, “none of them [the gender-inclusive emoji Hunt had proposed] were properly supported.” She pushed for implementation of Hunt’s proposal, releasing guidelines for the creation of a gender-neutral class of emoji as well.  For Hunt, emoji are powerful means of expression precisely because words sometimes fail us. They recall meeting their future husband, an Australian, while living in San Francisco: “When you get to know someone, you build a common story together and develop your own little language.” That language for Hunt and their spouse included the heart emoji with sprinkles, which became a “logo” for the budding relationship. “That emoji meant a lot to me,” they say. “It still does.”  ","Last year the Unicode Consortium—the group responsible for the selection and design of emoji—released a new series that reflected the multiplicity of gender identities.

"Exposing the messy, technologized, and undervalued nature of reproductive labor",https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/23/1057617/ani-liu-art-reproductive-labor/,2022-08-23,"<p>Artist Ani Liu’s work stands out for the precision with which it zeroes in on the frustrations of 21st-century motherhood.</p>
","Messy coils of plastic tubing sprawl across the gallery’s concrete floor. The liquid inside—opaque, white with a yellowish tinge—pulses once, twice, and the eye tracks its progress thanks to the air bubbles cycling through the loops. Could that be … milk? Follow the tubing back to an unassuming rectangular box. If it is milk, a panicked brain might ask, where is the mother? Having a child is an inherently optimistic act. People in the US are doing less and less of it. At this moment the mother, artist Ani Liu, is standing by the door of the pocket-­size Cuchifritos Gallery + Project Space in Lower Manhattan, wrapped in a tie-dyed T-shirt dress for tonight’s opening of her solo exhibition, “Ecologies of Care.” But she has also sat, pumping milk, in the broom closet next to her classroom at the University of Pennsylvania; in her basement studio in Queens; on trains and in cars. The volume of milk circulating through Untitled (pumping) and Untitled (feeding through space and time) represents a week of such sessions, or 5.85 gallons—some of the invisible labor of motherhood. It also represents modern breastfeeding technology—specifically, the Spectra pump that allowed Liu the alleged freedom to return to the workplace just weeks after having her first child. After headlines about a national formula shortage earlier this year, the liquid seems even more precious.  The milk in this exhibit is not real. After much experimenting, Liu ended up filling the pump with “magician’s milk,” a proprietary formula, purchased from a magic shop, that requires no refrigeration and comes with the warning “Not a food product. Do not drink!” Nevertheless, it looks convincing. When installing the piece, Liu originally considered having the milky coils take over the whole gallery floor, even more aggressively immersing visitors in the visual and aural landscape of newborn care. Liu, who holds graduate degrees from the Harvard Graduate School of Design and the MIT Media Lab, resumed teaching just five days after she gave birth in 2021. She had just signed a new contract as an associate professor of practice at Penn, and the university offers maternity leave only to employees of more than a year. Though she was initially allowed to teach over Zoom from her home in Queens, she ended up pumping more than nursing. “I developed this really intense relationship with my pump, where just hearing the sound of it made me let down, rather than my baby’s cry. It was just such a weird Donna Haraway cyborg moment,” she says, referring to the feminist science and technology scholar who wrote, of the cyborg, that it “does not dream of community on the model of the organic family.” It was also a moment that led Liu to new research. Her discoveries emerge in the works on display in the Cuchifritos Gallery, which include a series of three-dimensional meditations on technology, motherhood, and childhood in our algorithm-­enabled world.  Pumping is also on displayas part of the second edition of the exhibition “Designing Motherhood,” now at the MassArt Art Museum in Boston. Michelle Millar Fisher, part of the curatorial team, wrote that the work “cuts right to the heart of the ways in which reproductive labor is hidden, romanticized, socially taboo, and undervalued.”  Liu’s work has additional urgency and resonance after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Who controls, who supports, and who performs reproductive labor are not just bedroom or broom closet questions (and never should have been); they are playing out on the streets, in state houses, and in the Supreme Court.  Millar Fisher has drawn parallels between Liu’s pumping installation and the work of the artist Hiromi Marissa Ozaki, known as Sputniko!, whose 2010 Menstruation Machine simulates the experience of menstruation; the video part of the piece shows a fictional day in the life of a young man who builds a device to experience life as a person with a uterus.  Liu has long been fascinated by this sort of simulated experience. In 2019, after watching YouTube videos of men sampling simulated labor pains in order to understand their wives’ experience, and finding them wanting on multiple levels, she decided to create her own apparatuses, including a garment called Untitled (woman pains), fitted with a belly and electrodes, that would allow any non-pregnant person to experience the weight and discomforts of pregnancy. Another in the series, Untitled (small inconveniences), simulates incontinence. Made in collaboration with fabricator Randi Shandroski, the garments look like lingerie and simulate one result of sex, but these are not experiences generally considered sexy. Her pieces demonstrate a mischievous humor, embedded in the everyday indignities of modern life. Consumer culture might seem to celebrate pregnancy, but the products pushed to pregnant people focus on all the things that are “wrong” with the pregnant body: mood swings, stretch marks, incontinence. In response, Liu created Consumerist Pregnancy, which includes a series of creams, masks, and medications, designed in high millennial style (monochrome packaging, sans serif fonts) but honestly labeled “Fatigue,” “Shortness of Breath,” “Swelling.” If you saw them on a pharmacy shelf you would be initially attracted, but once you read the description, even as a person who has been pregnant, it would be hard not to say No, thank you.  The Surrogacy features a 3D-printed model of a multichambered pig’s uterus which, upon approach, reveals human fetuses in each chamber, a commentary on the ethics of assisted reproduction and the exploitation of human surrogates. Hung on the wall of the gallery is a spreadsheet that, upon inspection, reveals itself to be a minute-by-minute accounting of all the touchpoints of the first month of Liu’s daughter’s life (she’s now two): every feeding, every pee, every poop. One inspiration for the spreadsheet was Post-Partum Document, a 1973–’79 work by conceptual artist Mary Kelly, in which Kelly displayed the liners from her son’s cloth diapers as monochromes in white frames.  Untitled (Consumerist Pregnancy Reports): A set of ritual devices and consumable products made to simulate the biological experience of pregnancy. Liu’s work stands out not just for its topicality, or the precision with which it zeroes in on the frustrations of 21st-­century motherhood, but for its range. She is the kind of artist of whom you might say that she “works at the intersection of art and technology.” But that should really be “technologies,” plural. Different pieces have required her to delve into the intricacies of pumps, circuitry, machine learning, microscopy, and 3D printing, developing enough understanding of each field to identify the necessary expertise of her collaborators. When she was at the Media Lab she joined a biohacking club, which she found to be the ideal educational experience. No matter the question, she says, “someone would sit down with a beer and explain it.” Even her thesis project at the Media Lab, Mind Controlled Spermatozoa (2016–2017), recently wiggled back into the news as six Supreme Court justices, five male and one female, declared jurisdiction over child-bearing bodies.  For that project Liu researched galvanotaxis, the directed movement of an organism or cell in response to an electric field or current. In the accompanying video, she dons an EEG machine, which measures electrical activity in the brain. She then applies those signals to a magnified sample of her now-husband’s sperm and is actually able to direct the movement of spermatozoa to the left and right with her thoughts. (The science is real, if dramatized for the video.) As she writes, “I seek to challenge this status quo by engineering a system by which I (a woman) can control something inherently and symbolical male: spermatozoa (sperm).” The subtitle of the piece is “Women of STEAM Grab Back.” A week after the leak of the draft Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, Liu put the piece up on her Instagram with a new caption. “In the few times I’ve shown this work, men have often expressed to me how violating and unnatural it is to control sperm—sperm that is not even theirs, or in their body,” she wrote. “[T]hink of the plight of female bodies, that are constantly under threat of being controlled, regulated, censored.” Liu’s work attempts to shed light on the constant policing of cisgender women’s bodies, using the very machines and marketing techniques that typically oppress.  Design critic Alexandra Lange is the author of Meet Me by the Fountain: An Inside History of the Mall.

We may never fully know how video games affect our well-being,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/20/1058328/we-may-never-fully-know-how-video-games-affect-our-well-being/,2022-08-20,"<p>But researchers have pinpointed the data might help to provide more clues.</p>
","For decades, lawmakers, researchers, journalists, and parents have worried that video games are bad for us: that they encourage violent behavior or harm mental health. These fears have spilled into policy decisions affecting millions of people. The World Health Organization added “gaming disorder” to its International Classification of Diseases (ICD) in 2019, while China restricts people under 18 from playing games for more than three hours a week in a bid to prevent minors from becoming addicted. However, in recent years a growing body of research has argued that video games are in fact good for us, improving cognition, relieving stress, and bolstering communication skills.  The reality, a new study suggests, is that we simply don’t have a good grip on how games affect our well-being, if at all. The research, described in the Royal Society Open Science journal last month, found little to no evidence for a causal connection between game play and well-being, meaning that time spent playing video games had neither a negative nor positive effect on players’ emotional health. Researchers from the Oxford Internet Institute (OII) at the University of Oxford analyzed how long 38,935 players spent playing seven different games: Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Apex Legends, Eve Online, Forza Horizon 4, Gran Turismo Sport, Outriders, and The Crew 2. This data was provided directly by the games’ publishers—a rarity, as the vast majority of studies on video games rely on players’ self-reports of how long they spend gaming. The Oxford team says such data is biased and rarely accurate.  The gamers’ well-being was assessed through three surveys taken every two weeks over a six-week period. People ranked how often they experienced feelings including “pleasant” and “unpleasant,” and measured their general life satisfaction using the Cantril self-anchoring scale, picturing an imaginary ladder with the top rung representing their best possible life.  Additionally, they answered questions about their experiences and motivations. The researchers say that examining players’ emotional well-being through their moods and emotional experiences is a stepping-stone to assessing mental health.  Although the amount of time the participants spent playing games showed limited if any impact on their well-being, and the way they felt didn’t affect how long they spent gaming, their motivations did have an impact on their emotional state. Participants who played because they wanted to, rather than feeling compelled to play to beat a high score, for example, reported higher levels of well-being, although the relationship was small. Gamers would need to clock up an additional 10 hours a day on top of their average play for any noticeable effect to be observed. The research builds on the findings of a smaller study the same team published in 2020, which found a small positive relation between game play and well-being. This new study is the largest of its kind based on real player behavior collected from real games, which its authors say is a first step toward explicitly determining the real-world causal effects of playing video games on well-being over time.The findings demonstrate the complexity of making definite conclusions about how and why playing video games affects us. The science of researching games is relatively new, and studying them is tough because of how varied they are: a simple puzzle app on a smartphone is very different from a sprawling massively multiplayer online game, and modern games contain vast amounts of data. Another factor is that the industry’s technology evolves more quickly than researchers can conduct studies, meaning their methodologies for studying effects on mental health or aggression can be contentious.  Arguments over whether game addiction is real have led to feuds between government departments and a national debate over policy. The evidence base that the WHO and Chinese authorities are drawing from is “trash” and seriously mismatched to the scale of the decisions being based on them, says Andrew Przybylski, a senior research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute and coauthor of the report. “That’s not to say that countries, parents, and regulators don’t have a very serious role to play in making sure that games are safe and a rewarding part of people’s lives,” he says. “It just means that if we’re going to regulate them, and give parents advice, it has to be vaguely evidence based.” The moral panic around video games has stuck in a way that previous entertainment-fueled panics such as those around rock music and TV haven’t. But the evidence isn’t there.  Media reports that the perpetrators of mass shootings from the mid-1990s onwards were avid gamers, coupled with a slew of studies starting in the early 2000s, fueled concerns that violent games made people more aggressive. These reports found that participants “punished” opponents for longer, gave taste testers larger doses of hot sauce, and were more likely to guess aggressive words such as “explode” in a word completion task after playing violent games. But other researchers have since questioned how effective these studies really were at measuring violent behavior.  A 2020 meta-analysis in Royal Society Open Science, which reexamined 28 studies from previous years, found no evidence for a long-term link between aggressive video games and youth aggression. Lower-quality studies that didn’t use standardized or well-validated measures, it found, were more likely to exaggerate the effects of games on player aggression, while higher-quality studies tended to find negligible effects.  The same pattern has repeated with respect to studies linking video games to poor mental health, which tend to report smaller effects once they use objective data on game duration (as the OII study did) rather than relying on subjective self-reporting from participants, says Peter Etchells, a professor of psychology and science communication at Bath Spa University, who thinks the past 20 to 30 years of gaming studies haven’t had a consistent handle on what they were trying to measure or how to do it. “New studies like this one can help to draw a line under this whole ‘Are video games good or bad for us?’ line, because it is and always has been the wrong question to ask,” he says. “It’s like asking ‘Is food bad for our waistline?’ It’s a stupid question.” “My hope is that we can get better at not thinking about it in terms of ‘Are video games, are video games bad?’ but thinking about that gray area in between,” he adds. “Because that’s where all the interesting stuff is.” Przybylski was among a group of academics who wrote to the WHO in 2016 arguing against the “premature” inclusion of gaming disorder in its ICD guidelines, citing the low quality of the research base and the fact that scholars had failed to reach a consensus. Six years on, not much has changed, and researchers are still divided over the extent to which being addicted to games could differ from addiction to substances or gambling, for example. An interesting next step would be to focus on any participants demonstrating problematic behavior in the OII’s study to see how they can be coached or supported, says Tony van Rooij, a senior researcher at the Trimbos Institute in the Netherlands who focuses on gaming, gambling, and digital balance. Another worthwhile area of study, he says, is the predatory business models that game makers use to exert pressure on players’ behavior, including encouraging them to make microtransactions to skip frustrating levels, play at fixed times, or log in daily to avoid missing out on something. “In our research and experience, we tend to find that there is a large group of ‘healthy’ gamers, who benefit from their gaming,” he says. “But there also is a minority of gamers with unhealthy playing habits—often accompanied by various other issues in life. Gaming is not necessarily the cause of these issues, but obviously extreme participation in gaming needs to be taken into account to restore balance. The study is very rigorous and well done, but I hope it will be a starting point, not a final destination.” Przybylski hopes game companies will make it easier for players to share data from their play with independent researchers, though he concedes that the industry has no financial incentive to turn over that data and runs the risk that the studies will return undesirable results. “I think it’s totally crazy that people who are already signing over their genetics and health information for study can’t go in, eyes open, and donate their play data,” he says. “It’s theirs legally. It’s about making the tools available for something more creative than selling ads or figuring out new ways to monetize players.” Ultimately, despite researchers’ best efforts, academics studying games are unlikely to reach a solid conclusion on how they affect us, says Yemaya Halbrook, a psychology researcher for the Lero Esport Science Research Lab at the University of Limerick in Ireland.  “While we have been moving away from that slowly over the last decade or so, I don’t think there’s ever going to be a general consensus that video games have no positive or negative effect, or only a positive effect. There’s always going to be those people that say that video games are bad for you, and cite biased research,” she says. “We might be able to move them in a direction that says games aren’t entirely bad, but I don’t think we’ll ever get everybody to agree on a singular point, even if it’s a complete, total fact. People are not like that.” ","For decades, lawmakers, researchers, journalists, and parents have worried that video games are bad for us: that they encourage violent behavior or harm mental health. These fears have spilled into policy decisions affecting millions of people. The World Health Organization added “gaming disorder” to its International Classification of Diseases (ICD) in 2019, while China restricts people under 18 from playing games for more than three hours a week in a bid to prevent minors from becoming addicted. However, in recent years a growing body of research has argued that video games are in fact good for us, improving cognition, relieving stress, and bolstering communication skills. The reality, a new study suggests, is that we simply don’t have a good grip on how games affect our well-being, if at all. The research, described in the Royal Society Open Science journal last month, found little to no evidence for a causal connection between game play and well-being, meaning that time spent playing video games had neither a negative nor positive effect on players’ emotional health. Researchers from the Oxford Internet Institute (OII) at the University of Oxford analyzed how long 38,935 players spent playing seven different games: Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Apex Legends, Eve Online, Forza Horizon 4, Gran Turismo Sport, Outriders, and The Crew 2. This data was provided directly by the games’ publishers—a rarity, as the vast majority of studies on video games rely on players’ self-reports of how long they spend gaming. The Oxford team says such data is biased and rarely accurate. The gamers’ well-being was assessed through three surveys taken every two weeks over a six-week period. People ranked how often they experienced feelings including “pleasant” and “unpleasant,” and measured their general life satisfaction using the Cantril self-anchoring scale, picturing an imaginary ladder with the top rung representing their best possible life. Additionally, they answered questions about their experiences and motivations.

Ring’s new TV show is a brilliant but ominous viral marketing ploy,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/19/1058259/ring-nation-new-tv-show-viral-marketing/,2022-08-19,"<p><em>Ring Nation</em> wants to lure you in with funny content—and push you to buy a Ring camera to make your own.</p>
","There’s a genre of video floating around TikTok, Facebook, Nextdoor, and countless other social apps that you’ve probably seen, or at least scrolled past. They’re characterized by their brevity, their fish-eye framing, and often their prominent logo placement—which typically reads “Ring.com.”  This footage comes from Ring customers, who install the company’s camera devices to protect their homes, keep an eye on deliveries, and see or interact with who’s at the door.  The #RingDoorbell hashtag has 2.5 billion views on TikTok alone. Ring captures have become their own category of viral fame, and with the premiere next month of Ring Nation, videos like these will soon have the potential to reach even larger audiences.  At the same time, the show will launder the image of Ring—a company that, over the past almost-decade, has been continuously criticized for its often lax approach to customer data, and especially for allowing law enforcement to access user videos without consent.  Announced last week, Ring Nation will craft a careful image, featuring funny animals, marriage proposals, and heartwarming neighborhood interactions, according to a press release announcing the show. And, perhaps to distinguish the viewing experience from that of just watching any random playlist of Ring videos online, it will be narrated by comedian Wanda Sykes. It comes from MGM studios—which, along with Ring itself, is owned by Amazon—and is produced by Big Fish, the studio behind On Patrol: Live (previously known as LivePD, a controversial reality show that has also blurred the line between police action, and sometimes violence, and entertainment).  “Our customers share videos with us all the time demonstrating how their Ring products and services help connect them with their communities, and protect what matters most to them,” Ring representative Emma Daniels told MIT Technology Review in an email.  These videos will likely beget more videos, says Matthew Guariglia, a policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who focuses on privacy. The TV show will highlight for viewers how “there are so many funny little moments that will be priceless—when they’ve been caught on camera,” he explains. But that will “only spread the ultimate objective,” he adds, which is “being under surveillance …everywhere, all the time.”  And of course, to catch those moments on a Ring camera with its recognizable aesthetics—well, you’ll first need a Ring camera. Once something becomes a genre proven to get views, others will imitate the success of what they’re seeing online or (after September 26) on TV. That’s how internet virality works, and it essentially makes Ring Nation an extended viral marketing campaign that will produce more videos in an endless loop—with each video serving as low-cost marketing for the product itself.  Ring Nation is far from the first time the company, based in Santa Monica, California, has experimented with turning surveillance videos into entertainment.  The first such video made an appearance on the company’s YouTube channel in 2015, just a year after that channel was created. In the short 19-second clip, a mother holds a four-month-old infant in front of a Ring camera and guides the baby’s hand so that the baby appears to give a fistbump. It’s titled, “Bye Daddy! 4-Month-Old Gets to Say Bye Before Daycare Every Morning.” (Admittedly, it’s very cute.) Then, in 2018, the year that Amazon acquired the company, Ring added a new section to its website called Ring TV, a showcase of carefully curated videos from customers’ cameras. In many ways, Ring TV’s content was a predecessor to Ring Nation. Like the upcoming TV show, Ring TV features primarily funny animals, cute kids, and heartwarming neighborhood interactions.  Individual Ring owners also create their own viral media without Amazon’s direct involvement, uploading it to social media platforms where these sorts of videos get a ton of views. In one video with 3.3 million views, for instance, a teenager makes funny faces into the Ring camera outside her dad’s house. Another popular video (3 million views) shows an Amazon driver tripping in a yard as he tries to avoid stepping on the homeowner’s flowers. Many more show people that camera owners consider to be suspicious—often people of color. One example of this—a video with 4 million views—shows a white homeowner answering the door to find two men who speak limited English and who are asking for help putting out a car fire down the street. (At first, the Ring owner doesn't believe them, but he then changes his mind, keeping his viewers in the loop via caption.)   Partnerships with law enforcement give smart cameras to the survivors of domestic violence. But who does it really help? Meanwhile, earlier this year, some Ring users started a TikTok challenge, leaving notes for Amazon delivery drivers, requesting that they do trending dances in front of the camera. The footage, which rarely identifies the person performing a dance, was then uploaded to social media, growing the accounts of Ring owners and creating an even bigger demand for more dancing delivery drivers.  While these moments may appear fun and benign, experts like media psychologist Pamela Rutledge call their use a “sleight of hand,” designed to strip videos of the contexts in which they exist: the normalization of surveillance cameras and easy law enforcement access to Ring videos. This, she says, “subverts civil liberties ... by reframing the activity as normal and fun.”  One of the main liberties threatened by Ring, and the rise of surveillance technologies generally, is privacy and consent. It’s the Ring camera owner who agrees to Ring’s privacy policies and chooses how and whether to share the video by uploading it onto the accompanying Neighbors app or other social networks, making it available to the police, or sending it to the news media. But it’s not just camera owners that the devices capture. Many cameras point at public spaces, meaning any passerby could potentially be recorded, and recent reporting has shown how Ring devices can pick up audio from up to 20 feet away.  According to Daniels, the Ring representative, this type of footage captured without consent will not make it onto the show. “Like with everything we do, privacy is foundational to the show, and we secure permissions for each video from the owner and anyone identifiable in the video or from companies that hold the rights to the clips,” she told MIT Technology Review.  While this is certainly a step toward privacy on the show, and in this particular slice of content, it does little for the rest of us who inadvertently walk by Ring cameras in our daily lives.  In 2021, Ring sold 1.7 million devices, roughly the same number as its next four competitors combined, according to business intelligence firm Strategy Analytics. In other words, it has successfully dominated the market that it created—even while the results regarding safety have been questionable.

They’re characterized by their brevity, their fish-eye framing, and often their prominent logo placement—which typically reads “Ring.com.” This footage comes from Ring customers, who install the company’s camera devices to protect their homes, keep an eye on deliveries, and see or interact with who’s at the door. The #RingDoorbell hashtag has 2.5 billion views on TikTok alone. Ring captures have become their own category of viral fame, and with the premiere next month of Ring Nation, videos like these will soon have the potential to reach even larger audiences. At the same time, the show will launder the image of Ring—a company that, over the past almost-decade, has been continuously criticized for its often lax approach to customer data, and especially for allowing law enforcement to access user videos without consent. Announced last week, Ring Nation will craft a careful image, featuring funny animals, marriage proposals, and heartwarming neighborhood interactions, according to a press release announcing the show. And, perhaps to distinguish the viewing experience from that of just watching any random playlist of Ring videos online, it will be narrated by comedian Wanda Sykes. It comes from MGM studios—which, along with Ring itself, is owned by Amazon—and is produced by Big Fish, the studio behind On Patrol: Live (previously known as LivePD, a controversial reality show that has also blurred the line between police action, and sometimes violence, and entertainment). “Our customers share videos with us all the time demonstrating how their Ring products and services help connect them with their communities, and protect what matters most to them,” Ring representative Emma Daniels told MIT Technology Review in an email. These videos will likely beget more videos, says Matthew Guariglia, a policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who focuses on privacy. The TV show will highlight for viewers how “there are so many funny little moments that will be priceless—when they’ve been caught on camera,” he explains. But that will “only spread the ultimate objective,” he adds, which is “being under surveillance …everywhere, all the time.” And of course, to catch those moments on a Ring camera with its recognizable aesthetics—well, you’ll first need a Ring camera. Once something becomes a genre proven to get views, others will imitate the success of what they’re seeing online or (after September 26) on TV. That’s how internet virality works, and it essentially makes Ring Nation an extended viral marketing campaign that will produce more videos in an endless loop—with each video serving as low-cost marketing for the product itself. Ring Nation is far from the first time the company, based in Santa Monica, California, has experimented with turning surveillance videos into entertainment. The first such video made an appearance on the company’s YouTube channel in 2015, just a year after that channel was created. In the short 19-second clip, a mother holds a four-month-old infant in front of a Ring camera and guides the baby’s hand so that the baby appears to give a fistbump. It’s titled, “Bye Daddy! 4-Month-Old Gets to Say Bye Before Daycare Every Morning.” (Admittedly, it’s very cute.) Then, in 2018, the year that Amazon acquired the company, Ring added a new section to its website called Ring TV, a showcase of carefully curated videos from customers’ cameras. In many ways, Ring TV’s content was a predecessor to Ring Nation. Like the upcoming TV show, Ring TV features primarily funny animals, cute kids, and heartwarming neighborhood interactions. Individual Ring owners also create their own viral media without Amazon’s direct involvement, uploading it to social media platforms where these sorts of videos get a ton of views. In one video with 3.3 million views, for instance, a teenager makes funny faces into the Ring camera outside her dad’s house. Another popular video (3 million views) shows an Amazon driver tripping in a yard as he tries to avoid stepping on the homeowner’s flowers. Many more show people that camera owners consider to be suspicious—often people of color. One example of this—a video with 4 million views—shows a white homeowner answering the door to find two men who speak limited English and who are asking for help putting out a car fire down the street. (At first, the Ring owner doesn't believe them, but he then changes his mind, keeping his viewers in the loop via caption.) Partnerships with law enforcement give smart cameras to the survivors of domestic violence. But who does it really help? Meanwhile, earlier this year, some Ring users started a TikTok challenge, leaving notes for Amazon delivery drivers, requesting that they do trending dances in front of the camera. The footage, which rarely identifies the person performing a dance, was then uploaded to social media, growing the accounts of Ring owners and creating an even bigger demand for more dancing delivery drivers. While these moments may appear fun and benign, experts like media psychologist Pamela Rutledge call their use a “sleight of hand,” designed to strip videos of the contexts in which they exist: the normalization of surveillance cameras and easy law enforcement access to Ring videos. This, she says, “subverts civil liberties ... by reframing the activity as normal and fun.” One of the main liberties threatened by Ring, and the rise of surveillance technologies generally, is privacy and consent. It’s the Ring camera owner who agrees to Ring’s privacy policies and chooses how and whether to share the video by uploading it onto the accompanying Neighbors app or other social networks, making it available to the police, or sending it to the news media. But it’s not just camera owners that the devices capture. Many cameras point at public spaces, meaning any passerby could potentially be recorded, and recent reporting has shown how Ring devices can pick up audio from up to 20 feet away. According to Daniels, the Ring representative, this type of footage captured without consent will not make it onto the show. “Like with everything we do, privacy is foundational to the show, and we secure permissions for each video from the owner and anyone identifiable in the video or from companies that hold the rights to the clips,” she told MIT Technology Review. While this is certainly a step toward privacy on the show, and in this particular slice of content, it does little for the rest of us who inadvertently walk by Ring cameras in our daily lives. In 2021, Ring sold 1.7 million devices, roughly the same number as its next four competitors combined, according to business intelligence firm Strategy Analytics. In other words, it has successfully dominated the market that it created—even while the results regarding safety have been questionable. Previous MIT Technology Review reporting shows that evidence on whether Ring cameras actually reduce crime in a neighborhood is flimsy. Its market domination came, in no small part, as a result of Ring’s efforts, starting in 2016, to partner with law enforcement agencies. At various points, the company offered free cameras to individual officers, as well as entire departments, often in exchange for promoting Ring in the officers’ jurisdictions. For a time, they also offered police partners a special portal to access community videos—stopping only after multiple media outlets reported on the process, which was followed by public outcry.

The fight for “Instagram face”,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/19/1057133/fight-for-instagram-face/,2022-08-19,"<p>Meta banned filters that “encourage plastic surgery,” but a massive demand for beauty augmentation on social media is complicating matters.</p>
","In October 2021, Facebook announced a massive pivot, changing its name to Meta and going all in on augmented and virtual reality through a futuristic vision of the internet called the metaverse. In fact, the strategy had been taking shape gradually for years, with help from a seemingly frivolous product feature on Instagram. Face filters that add puppy ears to your hairline or make your lips appear bigger sit on a sophisticated technical infrastructure for AR and VR that the company, which owns Instagram as well as WhatsApp, has built to support such effects. Thousands of creators have contributed filters free of charge, and the millions of people around the world who use the feature each day have provided Meta with troves of data.  The little research that exists about digital beauty culture has found that visual platforms like Instagram, which rely on AI recommendation algorithms, are narrowing beauty standards at a stunningly rapid pace. Through filters, they’re also helping users achieve those ideals—though only in the digital world. There is evidence that excessive use of these filters online has harmful effects on mental health, especially for young girls. “Instagram face” is a recognized aesthetic template: ethnically ambiguous and featuring the flawless skin, big eyes, full lips, small nose, and perfectly contoured curves made accessible in large part by filters. Some people are excited to see realistic avatars that look like them. Others worry it might make body image issues even worse. But behind every filter is a person dragging lines and shifting shapes on a computer screen to achieve the desired look. Beauty may be subjective, and yet society continues to promote stringent, unattainable ideals that—for women and girls—are disproportionately white, slender, and feminine.  Instagram publishes very little data about filters, especially beauty filters. In September of 2020, Meta announced that over 600 million people had tried at least one of its AR features. The metaverse is a concept much bigger than Meta and other companies investing in AR and VR products. Snap and TikTok capture huge numbers of filter users, though Snap is also investing in place-based AR. Meta’s product suite includes the Oculus headset and Ray-Ban smart glasses, but it’s focused on what made Facebook popular—the face. Beauty filters, especially those that dramatically alter the shape of a face and its features, are particularly popular—and contested. Instagram banned these so-called deformation effects from October 2019 until August 2020 because of concerns about the impact they have on mental health. The policy has since been updated to outlaw only filters that encourage plastic surgery. The policy states that “content must not promote the use or depict the sale of a potentially dangerous cosmetic procedure, as per the Facebook Community Standards. This includes effects that depict such procedures through surgery lines.” According to a statement to MIT Technology Review in April 2021, this policy is enforced by “a combination of human and automated systems to review effects as they are submitted for publishing.” Creators told me, however, that deformation filters often get flagged inconsistently, and it’s not clear what exactly encourages the use of cosmetic surgery.  Though many people use beauty filters merely for fun and entertainment, those puppy ears are actually a big technical feat. First they require face detection, in which an algorithm interprets the various shades of pixels picked up by a camera to identify a face and its features. A digital mask of some standard face is then applied to the image of the real face and adjusts to its shape, aligning the mask’s virtual jawline and nose to the person’s. On that mask, graphics developed by coders create the effects seen on the screen. Computer vision technology of just the past few years has allowed this to happen in real time and in motion.  Spark AR is Instagram’s software developer kit, or SDK, and it allows creators of augmented-reality effects to more easily make and share the face filters that cover the Instagram feed. It is in this deep rabbit hole of filter demonstration videos on YouTube that I first came across Florencia Solari, a creative AR technologist and a well-known creator of filters on Instagram. She showed me how to make a face filter that promised to plump and lift my cheeks and fill out my lips for that Kardashianesque, surgically enhanced face shape. “Thirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse.” “I have this inflate tool that I am going to apply with symmetry,” Solari said, “because any modifications that I do to this face, I want to be symmetrical.” I tried to keep up by dragging the outline of my digital mannequin’s cheekbone up and out with my cursor. Next, I right-clicked on the map of her bottom lip and selected “Increase” several times, playing God. Soon, with Solari as my guide, I had a filter that, while sloppy and simple, I could upload to Instagram and unleash to the world.  Solari is part of a new class of AR and VR creators who have made a career by mastering this technology. She started coding when she was around nine years old and was drawn to the creativity of virtual-­world development. Making her own filters on Instagram was a hobby at first. But in 2020, Solari left a full-time job as an AR developer at Ulta Beauty to pursue online AR full time as an independent consultant. She’s recently worked with Meta and several other big brands (which she says she can’t disclose) to create branded AR web experiences, including filters.  Solari’s very first filter, called “vedette++,” went viral back in September 2019. “I tried to make an interpretation of what the superstar of the future would be,” Solari says. The filter applies an iridescent, slightly green shine to the skin, which is smoothed all over and inflated under each eye to the point that it looks as if half a clementine has been shoved inside each cheek. Lips double in size, and face shape is adjusted so that a distinct jawline tapers into a small chin. “It was kind of a mix of an alien, but with a face that looked like it was full of Botox,” says Solari. “It really became, like, sensational.” The most widespread use of augmented reality isn’t in gaming: it’s the face filters on social media. The result? A mass experiment on girls and young women. Though Meta doesn’t make its filter data public, it does provide creators with some metrics, and I asked Solari and others to share the data with me. The numbers are stunning; vedette++ was viewed 130 million times and used over 1.2 million times in 3.5 months. Solari says the filter was one of the first ever to go viral. It helped that vedette++ was used by model and influencer Bella Hadid. “Influencers have a huge impact on how this spreads … You will get an influencer or a celebrity to use them, and then it will go more viral organically,” she says. According to Solari’s statistics from Meta, vedette++’s impressions spiked exponentially in the days after Hadid used the filter.  Creators say that deformation effects and influencer shares are the keys to virality where filters are concerned. Several creators said the demand for deformation beauty filters is so consistent that they can essentially gamify virality by making a certain kind of effect that fits the “Instagram face” aesthetic.  “This is something we don’t speak about—that deformation can make your filter go viral. If you don’t use deformation, your filter won’t succeed as much as the other ones, even if the others are more technically complicated,” says Lucie Bouchet, a popular filter creator. Bouchet notes that there are exceptions to this pattern, and filters that are especially fun, trendy, or unique also see massive success. Bouchet has stopped using deformation effects in many of her filters and now builds in a feature that enables the deformation effects only if users choose.  But the statistics are hard to ignore. Bouchet’s most popular deformation filter, called “Golden Hair,” amassed almost 300 million impressions, while a similar one without deformation effects garnered a measly 7.2 million. Around 70% of the people using her filters are between 13 and 24. Bouchet’s concerns about the harmful effects of deformation filters, especially on girls, are shared by many creators who make them. I spoke with researcher Claire Pescott in the spring of 2021, when I first wrote about the effects of beauty filters on social media. Pescott studies the behavior of preteens on social media and has observed gender differences in filter use. She found that boys use filters primarily for fun and experimentation, and girls use them to enhance their appearance.  Though Meta declined to speak with me on the record for this story, the company has taken some steps to address recent criticism surrounding the negative impact that Instagram can have on the mental health of users, particularly teenage girls. When whistleblower Frances Haugen came forward with internal company documents, some showed that its leaders had known about these problems for years. According to reporting by the Wall Street Journal, a March 2020 slide presentation by Facebook researchers read, “Thirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse.” Another slide said, “We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls,” and acknowledged that “comparisons on Instagram can change how young women view and describe themselves.” Filters on platforms like Meta, TikTok, and Snapchat are not the only technology working to narrow beauty standards. Photo-editing tools have also exploded over the past 10 years with the rise of social media, and the results can have similar effects on aesthetics and mental health online. Recommendation algorithms and social preferences for certain looks can also  create harm on visual platforms.  But Solari thinks technology itself is not to blame in the first place. “It is not the filters that are making this [problem], but society is like this,” she says. “These are the values that society has and sees as beautiful. And that’s why it goes viral.” Creators observe a consistent and shockingly high demand for deformation beauty filters that fit a particular aesthetic. In December 2019, Instagram banned vedette++ as part of its clampdown on deformation effects. Solari says she wasn’t trying to encourage plastic surgery and believes that most people using her filter wanted to “perform with a face that just looked kind of out of this world.”  She responded to the deformation ban with a scathing Medium post that was widely shared among filter creator communities. It reads: “This isn’t about plastic surgery. This is about FREEDOM. It’s about preserving the most valuable and unique thing we own: Who we are. Our individuality … The internet was our free space. It was a mask, yes, indeed. A mask that served us to be able to BE TRUE to ourselves. Express ourselves beyond our bodies, beyond our physical realities, explore the trans-human and the fantasy.” It’s this fantasy—this opportunity for escapism and expression—that many creators point to when they defend filters, saying that AR and VR offer the ability to test out certain personas and play. Pescott, the researcher, told me that trying on different identities and demonstrating them socially is an essential and healthy part of adolescence. For many people, filters offer a new way to do that.  Solari has thought a lot about the tension between censorship and safety since vedette++’s viral success and subsequent ban. “I don’t believe in censorship of that kind of content, because I believe that people should be able to choose what they want to adopt or not,” she says. But Solari also believes that strict beauty standards do make it hard for people to accept themselves fully. “If we actually want to address this,” she says, “we have to look for a way to help people to really build the strength to say ‘I like myself as I am. I want to show myself as I am.’”  “I find beauty in authenticity, in freedom, and in what I find to be the perfect balance between order and chaos,” she says.

There is evidence that excessive use of these filters online has harmful effects on mental health, especially for young girls. “Instagram face” is a recognized aesthetic template: ethnically ambiguous and featuring the flawless skin, big eyes, full lips, small nose, and perfectly contoured curves made accessible in large part by filters. Some people are excited to see realistic avatars that look like them. Others worry it might make body image issues even worse. But behind every filter is a person dragging lines and shifting shapes on a computer screen to achieve the desired look. Beauty may be subjective, and yet society continues to promote stringent, unattainable ideals that—for women and girls—are disproportionately white, slender, and feminine. Instagram publishes very little data about filters, especially beauty filters. In September of 2020, Meta announced that over 600 million people had tried at least one of its AR features. The metaverse is a concept much bigger than Meta and other companies investing in AR and VR products. Snap and TikTok capture huge numbers of filter users, though Snap is also investing in place-based AR. Meta’s product suite includes the Oculus headset and Ray-Ban smart glasses, but it’s focused on what made Facebook popular—the face. Beauty filters, especially those that dramatically alter the shape of a face and its features, are particularly popular—and contested. Instagram banned these so-called deformation effects from October 2019 until August 2020 because of concerns about the impact they have on mental health. The policy has since been updated to outlaw only filters that encourage plastic surgery. The policy states that “content must not promote the use or depict the sale of a potentially dangerous cosmetic procedure, as per the Facebook Community Standards. This includes effects that depict such procedures through surgery lines.” According to a statement to MIT Technology Review in April 2021, this policy is enforced by “a combination of human and automated systems to review effects as they are submitted for publishing.” Creators told me, however, that deformation filters often get flagged inconsistently, and it’s not clear what exactly encourages the use of cosmetic surgery. Though many people use beauty filters merely for fun and entertainment, those puppy ears are actually a big technical feat. First they require face detection, in which an algorithm interprets the various shades of pixels picked up by a camera to identify a face and its features. A digital mask of some standard face is then applied to the image of the real face and adjusts to its shape, aligning the mask’s virtual jawline and nose to the person’s. On that mask, graphics developed by coders create the effects seen on the screen. Computer vision technology of just the past few years has allowed this to happen in real time and in motion. Spark AR is Instagram’s software developer kit, or SDK, and it allows creators of augmented-reality effects to more easily make and share the face filters that cover the Instagram feed. It is in this deep rabbit hole of filter demonstration videos on YouTube that I first came across Florencia Solari, a creative AR technologist and a well-known creator of filters on Instagram. She showed me how to make a face filter that promised to plump and lift my cheeks and fill out my lips for that Kardashianesque, surgically enhanced face shape. “Thirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse.” “I have this inflate tool that I am going to apply with symmetry,” Solari said, “because any modifications that I do to this face, I want to be symmetrical.” I tried to keep up by dragging the outline of my digital mannequin’s cheekbone up and out with my cursor. Next, I right-clicked on the map of her bottom lip and selected “Increase” several times, playing God. Soon, with Solari as my guide, I had a filter that, while sloppy and simple, I could upload to Instagram and unleash to the world. Solari is part of a new class of AR and VR creators who have made a career by mastering this technology. She started coding when she was around nine years old and was drawn to the creativity of virtual-­world development. Making her own filters on Instagram was a hobby at first. But in 2020, Solari left a full-time job as an AR developer at Ulta Beauty to pursue online AR full time as an independent consultant. She’s recently worked with Meta and several other big brands (which she says she can’t disclose) to create branded AR web experiences, including filters. Solari’s very first filter, called “vedette++,” went viral back in September 2019. “I tried to make an interpretation of what the superstar of the future would be,” Solari says. The filter applies an iridescent, slightly green shine to the skin, which is smoothed all over and inflated under each eye to the point that it looks as if half a clementine has been shoved inside each cheek. Lips double in size, and face shape is adjusted so that a distinct jawline tapers into a small chin. “It was kind of a mix of an alien, but with a face that looked like it was full of Botox,” says Solari. “It really became, like, sensational.” The most widespread use of augmented reality isn’t in gaming: it’s the face filters on social media. The result? A mass experiment on girls and young women. Though Meta doesn’t make its filter data public, it does provide creators with some metrics, and I asked Solari and others to share the data with me. The numbers are stunning; vedette++ was viewed 130 million times and used over 1.2 million times in 3.5 months. Solari says the filter was one of the first ever to go viral. It helped that vedette++ was used by model and influencer Bella Hadid. “Influencers have a huge impact on how this spreads … You will get an influencer or a celebrity to use them, and then it will go more viral organically,” she says. According to Solari’s statistics from Meta, vedette++’s impressions spiked exponentially in the days after Hadid used the filter. Creators say that deformation effects and influencer shares are the keys to virality where filters are concerned. Several creators said the demand for deformation beauty filters is so consistent that they can essentially gamify virality by making a certain kind of effect that fits the “Instagram face” aesthetic. “This is something we don’t speak about—that deformation can make your filter go viral. If you don’t use deformation, your filter won’t succeed as much as the other ones, even if the others are more technically complicated,” says Lucie Bouchet, a popular filter creator. Bouchet notes that there are exceptions to this pattern, and filters that are especially fun, trendy, or unique also see massive success. Bouchet has stopped using deformation effects in many of her filters and now builds in a feature that enables the deformation effects only if users choose. But the statistics are hard to ignore. Bouchet’s most popular deformation filter, called “Golden Hair,” amassed almost 300 million impressions, while a similar one without deformation effects garnered a measly 7.2 million. Around 70% of the people using her filters are between 13 and 24. Bouchet’s concerns about the harmful effects of deformation filters, especially on girls, are shared by many creators who make them. I spoke with researcher Claire Pescott in the spring of 2021, when I first wrote about the effects of beauty filters on social media. Pescott studies the behavior of preteens on social media and has observed gender differences in filter use. She found that boys use filters primarily for fun and experimentation, and girls use them to enhance their appearance. Though Meta declined to speak with me on the record for this story, the company has taken some steps to address recent criticism surrounding the negative impact that Instagram can have on the mental health of users, particularly teenage girls. When whistleblower Frances Haugen came forward with internal company documents, some showed that its leaders had known about these problems for years. According to reporting by the Wall Street Journal, a March 2020 slide presentation by Facebook researchers read, “Thirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse.” Another slide said, “We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls,” and acknowledged that “comparisons on Instagram can change how young women view and describe themselves.” Filters on platforms like Meta, TikTok, and Snapchat are not the only technology working to narrow beauty standards. Photo-editing tools have also exploded over the past 10 years with the rise of social media, and the results can have similar effects on aesthetics and mental health online. Recommendation algorithms and social preferences for certain looks can also create harm on visual platforms. But Solari thinks technology itself is not to blame in the first place. “It is not the filters that are making this [problem], but society is like this,” she says. “These are the values that society has and sees as beautiful. And that’s why it goes viral.” Creators observe a consistent and shockingly high demand for deformation beauty filters that fit a particular aesthetic. In December 2019, Instagram banned vedette++ as part of its clampdown on deformation effects. Solari says she wasn’t trying to encourage plastic surgery and believes that most people using her filter wanted to “perform with a face that just looked kind of out of this world.” She responded to the deformation ban with a scathing Medium post that was widely shared among filter creator communities. It reads: “This isn’t about plastic surgery. This is about FREEDOM. It’s about preserving the most valuable and unique thing we own: Who we are. Our individuality … The internet was our free space. It was a mask, yes, indeed. A mask that served us to be able to BE TRUE to ourselves. Express ourselves beyond our bodies, beyond our physical realities, explore the trans-human and the fantasy.” It’s this fantasy—this opportunity for escapism and expression—that many creators point to when they defend filters, saying that AR and VR offer the ability to test out certain personas and play. Pescott, the researcher, told me that trying on different identities and demonstrating them socially is an essential and healthy part of adolescence. For many people, filters offer a new way to do that. Solari has thought a lot about the tension between censorship and safety since vedette++’s viral success and subsequent ban. “I don’t believe in censorship of that kind of content, because I believe that people should be able to choose what they want to adopt or not,” she says. But Solari also believes that strict beauty standards do make it hard for people to accept themselves fully. “If we actually want to address this,” she says, “we have to look for a way to help people to really build the strength to say ‘I like myself as I am. I want to show myself as I am.’” “I find beauty in authenticity, in freedom, and in what I find to be the perfect balance between order and chaos,” she says.","['facebook', 'announce', 'massive',

A heritage financial services institution isn’t necessarily the first place a technologist looks to grow their career. But that hasn’t been a problem for JPMorgan Chase, which has made itself an appealing career destination for technologists. “Technology is not an afterthought,” says Gill Haus, chief information officer of consumer and community banking at JPMorgan Chase. “It is in everything we do, from our offices to our branches to our contact centers to our web and mobile applications.” Haus explains that there’s more to being a technology company than using technology to solve problems. “What really makes a technology company is how you think about the way you hire teams, the way you groom teams, the way you build software, the way you deploy that software,” says Haus. “It's how you organize around products, not around your business units.” Like a technology startup, the technical teams at JPMorgan Chase solve real-world problems. “Every single day, we are launching new features and products that make it easier for everyone. It's incredibly exciting,” says Haus. However, unlike a startup, JPMorgan Chase has scale. The financial services institution supports 44 million mobile active customers and 59 million digitally active customers in general. The company spends $12 billion on technology annually. “When we launch a solution or bring a new product to market, we don't bring it to market for 1,000 people. We don't bring it to market for a 100,000 people. We bring it to market for millions of customers immediately, and that is incredible,” says Haus. “There's incredible talent here, as you can imagine, because we have such a technical need. Talent begets talent. It's exciting to go to a place where you know you're going to be challenged.” Laurel Ruma: From MIT Technology Review, I'm Laurel Ruma and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace. Our topic today is innovation at scale. Established institutions in every industry have found themselves competing against cloud-born startups that run lean and mean. Legacy companies must not only innovate, but do so on a significantly larger scale than the current generation and much faster to maintain that scale in a rapidly changing marketplace. But success is possible. Two words for you. Scaling innovation. My guest today is Gill Haus, who is the chief information officer of consumer and community banking at JPMorgan Chase. Gill heads the Chase technology team, and is a member of both the consumer and community banking leadership team, and the firm's global technology leadership team. This podcast is produced in association with JPMorgan Chase. Welcome, Gill. Gill Haus: Thank you for having me, Laurel. Laurel: You've worked at a number of different companies, including PayPal and Curb, which is formerly known as RideCharge. What's it like working at a large financial institution after being at several fintechs? And why did you join JPMorgan Chase? Gill: I'll answer it in reverse, which is what led me to come to a company like a JPMorgan Chase. There is a size and a scale that is incredibly attractive, particularly given the technology challenges that we face. To put it in perspective, we have 44 million digitally active mobile customers and 59 million digitally active customers in general. Getting the experience right for them, making it load quickly, showing all the information their customer needs in a secure way, that's a technical masterpiece, and that's exciting for me and that's why I joined a firm like this. That's just the Chase portion of the business, not to mention our corporate and investment bank and other parts of our organization. There's also incredible talent here, as you can imagine, because of the fact that we have such a technical need. Talent begets talent. It's exciting to go to a place where you know that you're going to be challenged. You're going to learn from other people. But also, there's a culture. This one's important and it goes to the first part of your question. There's a culture here of, “We can tackle these problems. We are a startup on our own.” We look at any of the challenges facing us, whether it is in our consumer business, whether it's in our asset wealth management business, whether it's in investment international, and we look at each of those problems the way that a startup would. So, it feels very much like a startup here, like when I was at PayPal or Curb or other companies. The difference is we have the scale, so we have the resources at our disposal should we need them. We have the money to actually be able to make a difference. I do love startups having been there, but unlike some startups, when we launch a solution or bring some new product to market, we don't bring it to market for 1,000 people. We don't bring it to market for 100,000 people. We bring that to market for millions of customers immediately, and that is incredible. The other piece of this, which is really great about a startup, is purpose. A lot of the places that I joined when I was at a startup was because we're going to change the world. We're going to change ride share, which is why I joined Curb. At PayPal we were acquired, but it was about changing how money is used. The purpose that we have here at JPMorgan Chase is incredible because finance is at the center of everyone's life. There's nothing more personal than finance. Whether it is an individual customer, a small business, or a corporation or a government, money is so incredibly important. Every single day, we are launching new features and products that make it easier for everyone. It's incredibly exciting. The technical challenge is huge and that's why it feels a lot like a startup almost every single day, but also why I joined the organization. Laurel: You started as the head of digital technology and probably much like a startup, you moved along quite quickly to lead Chase's technology organization as CIO. How has your role changed? And what advice would you give to technologists who might actually follow that career path? Gill: If you had asked me years ago, “Do you want to be a CIO, whether it's here or anywhere else?” I don't know Laurel, if I would've said yes. And now that I know, I might go like, ""What, really? I don't know."" But what really kept me moving in my career were a few things. The first was the technology itself. I've always been passionate about technology. The roles that I've had have been on solving technical problems and having a curiosity and being technical. Now, I'm not as hands-on as I once was, but I do read constantly about technology. I get into the architecture, and I've done that throughout my career. That's an important thing too, because I believe that anyone that wants to be a CIO or a CTO, particularly in the way that the industry is progressing, you need to understand technology. So, staying close to the technology and curious and wanting to solve those problems has helped me. But there's another part to it, too. In every one of my roles, there have been times when I've seen something that wasn't necessarily working and I had ideas and wanted to help, but it might’ve been outside of my responsibility. I've always leaned in to help, even though I knew that it was going to help someone else in the organization, because it was the right thing to do and it helped the company, it helped other people. So, it ended up building stronger relationships, but also building my skillset. I think that's been a part of my rise too, and it's something that's just incredibly powerful from a cultural perspective. That’s something that I love here. Everybody is in it together to work that way. But I also think that it just speaks volumes about an individual, and people gravitate to want to work with people that operate that way. The reality is we all need help and there have been so many people that have done that for me in my career, and I either hire them or they've hired me and we stay close. So, that's been something else has been important in my career path. The last piece that I would say is, it's important to have two things. There is one, the excitement about the work. And I have that here. I had it in my last role here too, which is there's an excitement about the changes you're making every day, about the problem set and the technologies that we can use and the opportunity. That's really important because that ensures that you're always going to be excited, even if there's a bad day. The other thing that I make sure of is, am I a bit scared? Not scared like something bad is going to happen, but more scared like, can I do it? Do I understand how the technology works? Do I know how to navigate this situation? Having that means you're going to grow and you're going to learn skills you didn't learn before. So you won't get bored because you can get excited, and after a while the excitement wanes, but you still are really jazzed about the things that you're learning. I urge people to find roles where they have both of those challenges. If you have a cultural view of, I'm going to try to solve the problems and it's bigger than me, it's about the company, and I'm going to put myself in a situation that I'm having fun, you'll have energy. And I'm also a little bit scared, you're going to learn. That's the best way, I think, to grow someone's career. And what's so exciting here is we have so many awesome problems to solve, so many incredible people that are looking for assistance, that you just have an environment where people can grow their careers really quickly. I was surprised that I became CIO so quickly, but you can point to so many examples in this company where people that bring the attitude, the aptitude, the skill and the passion, they continue to grow because we're doing some incredible things, and we respect and we value that in our leaders. Laurel: Speaking of problem solving, for a lot of organizations, the pandemic accelerated digital transformation initiatives out of necessity. Perhaps some organizations had a five-year plan to roll out video collaboration solutions for remote work, but suddenly they had to make that a priority when everyone was home for the pandemic. Where was JPMorgan Chase in its digital transformation journey in early 2020, and did you feel the need to accelerate any initiatives to get through that pandemic? Gill: I'm smiling because I joined JPMC on March second of 2020, so it was right before we went into lockdown. I got to see the before and the after really quickly. One of the things that was incredibly apparent then and continues to be apparent is that our customer is our number one focus. That has always been the case and COVID didn't change that. In fact, it was a rallying call for the organization, that we need to make sure even more so, that we're doing right for our customers because our customers were unable to visit branches or perform the services they were used to. And they were also impacted by the pandemic themselves on their finances, etc. So, it was super clear about the mission we had here, even more so, we want to make sure that we're helping those that really depend on us. You could see it in the way that everyone rallied around solving problems. There were some things that the pandemic also drove. There was an increase in digital engagement. That would've probably happened anywhere to your point about a five-year plan, but that was fast-tracked because people were at home, and they needed to transact, and they used their digital devices because there was no other way. I believe that's here to stay and that digital adoption, that acceleration, we're seeing it because we are up 6% year over year. If you think about our digitally active customers, so 58.8 million customers. I mentioned the mobile number, we're up 11% year over year. That's something that we're continuing to see happen. Once you're using our mobile, or you're using web, it's hard to necessarily go back, but you still can. It required us to roll out video conferencing globally to our employees in a span of a weekend, which is not for the faint of heart. When you think about the 200,000 employees that we have, we were able to roll this out at that pace, which speaks not just to the technical powers we have more broadly in the firm, but to how adaptable we are when these sorts of things occur. That was all because we wanted to make sure that our people could service our customers the best way that we could. Remember, we have people that work in our call centers, and they were impacted, and we have people that work in branches, and they're impacted, etc. One of the things that was really clear when the pandemic occurred was how quickly our teams could deploy new software. Many talk about being able to build quickly and being agile. There's the Paycheck Protection Program, and this was the ability to offer small businesses who were not having as much traffic, etc., loans through the government. We had about a week to put this in place, and we were able to stand up that portal in about a week. We had it fully automated in a matter of two-ish weeks, and we were able to provide more funding than any other lender in both 2020 and 2021, which was just incredible. The fact that we were able to build that because of the technology we've invested in over the past years, build that so quickly and scale that to such a large volume for our customers was huge. But we also were able to make some fundamental changes in mobile. We were able to enhance things which might seem simple. We have a product inside of our mobile application called QuickDeposit, and this is where you're able to deposit a check. But as many know, sometimes checks are large numbers. Traditionally we asked people to go into branches to help prevent fraud. Because of the technology that we have, we were able to raise limits in a way that ensured that we were able to manage through fraud appropriately and allow customers that would have formerly had to come into a branch or ATM, make the deposits electronically. Those are the kinds of things that we've seen change, but the pace that we moved, that's not just limited to the Chase part of the business, but we saw this across all of J.P. Morgan. There’s one piece that I think is important on this Laurel. I was in a meeting and here I am a new person in the organization working on the Paycheck Protection Program. I recall there being somebody on Zoom. We were having a conversation and I assumed because I was new and they were in the meeting that they were on my team, and the person said, ""Oh no, I'm not on your team, but I know you're new and you needed assistance. And so here I am to help, and I just figured I'd navigate."" And that has stuck with me about the culture of this organization and how we focus on the customer both externally and internally, to really make sure that we are providing the best service that we possibly can. Laurel: That certainly requires an agile mindset. So, how is JPMorgan Chase transforming into an agile organization? You've laid a couple examples. Clearly you would not have been able to respond to the US government's Payroll Protection Act that quickly if you hadn't been already working on a number of these opportunities and abilities to be more agile. So, what lessons have you learned along the way and how have your teams and customers benefited from this shift? Gill: Oh, yes. An agile transformation is a really hard thing to do. Many people are making agile transformations, so it sounds like it should be easy. You have your scrums, and you have your various ceremonies and retrospectives, and you use a tool to manage your backlog and you're golden. One of the big challenges that we as a company had faced in JPMorgan, was we were organized more around our software and platforms than around our customer and the experiences back. That made it really frustrating for teams because it meant that you likely needed 10, maybe 12 different organizations to agree on building something. It wasn't clear who the owner was. The architectures sometimes would be a bit more frail because you were working through multiple teams. If you want to move quickly or you want to innovate, that's not a model in which you're able to actually operate. You can force it, but it requires many more meetings. It's difficult to know who the decision makers are. You can move more slowly and sometimes an application or a solution looks like many teams built it. There's Conway's Law, and you may have probably mentioned this before on other podcasts, but Dr. Conway said that your software will reflect how you're organized. That's really what we had seen. So, as opposed to us just trying to find a way to navigate around it, we said as an organization, “We're truly going to become agile, and we're going to accept Conway's Law, and we're going to organize around our products back.” In the community and consumer bank, we organized around 100 products, so we have a thousand teams that are aligned around these products. A product, for example, is something like account opening. So, I want to open an account on mobile or web. There is one product for this. There is one product leader, one design leader, one data leader, and one technology leader that are accountable for that product. Now we know who can manage the backlog. Now we know who can work through any kind of architectural decisions. Now we understand who is accountable for ensuring that we have innovation and understanding that customer needs. That has allowed us to pivot quickly, because if I need to move, I can work with the account opening team, they can make the decisions, they can manage a backlog, and they're able to adapt when we have things like the Paycheck Protection Program or other types of efforts that are out there. But it also gives more purpose to the individual teams because they set their destiny, they have more autonomy, and they're working together between tech and product design and data, so we can build the right solutions that we need. This creates a great experience for people in the organization. By the way, the whole of JPMC is moving to operate this way. This lets us not just move more quickly, it gives better work life balance for our employees and less frustration, because it's easier to know where you are. You have that purpose and you accept being part of a particular team. I mentioned we can respond more quickly when there is a challenge, but it's not just those challenges like PPP or a pandemic that we have to address, Laurel. There are places where our customer's needs are changing every single day. And by organizing around products this way, we can understand the data from our customers, and we can experiment, and we can adapt in a truly agile fashion for what our customers really need, versus what we think they might need and building something that doesn't really resonate with them. It allows us to operate in a truly agile fashion, which we were not able to do before and it's quite incredible being able to make a change like this at such scale. Laurel: With those hundreds of products and millions of customers, what are some of the challenges and opportunities that your teams face when operating on this scale? Gill: We are a company, so it's a job. And there are going to be the normal things that you would see in a company, which is we have to prioritize. We're like any other company in that respect. However, working here, in my opinion, is incredible. When you write code in this organization, you are deploying it at scale. The problems that we are solving that could be frustrating because it could be a day where this code isn't working or I'm running into this blocker, I can't figure it out or, I have to support some other change that's occurred — when we make those changes for our engineers, for our product, our design, our data leaders, we are deploying this at scale. The other part is we include the feedback from our millions upon millions of customers to improve an experience and improve the life of those customers. That's something that keeps me going every single day. Yeah, I might feel like this project's been a bit harder than it should have been. However, the difference that I'm making for a customer on every single day is tangible. Somebody buying groceries for their family, somebody buying their first car, somebody refinancing their house, you name it -- the list goes on. Because the work that's being done every single day is making that positive impact, I just feel incredible about it and I think everyone else in the organization does, too. This is the kind of thing that makes me excited about being here. Even if there is a challenge on a particular day. Now, there are things we want to do. We want to deliver software more quickly, and we're constantly working on improving in that space. We have a ton of products that we continue to improve, but that's the opportunity, which is we have thousands of engineers. We hire thousands of designers. And every day we're making it better, but we're also learning. And that's the career opportunity for people because what you join the company to do today, could be something different that you do in a year. That's exciting because what we learn to do in one of our other divisions, we go, ""That's wonderful, bring that over."" Career opportunity, mobility opportunity. And it's a career mindset every single day for people that's exciting and that's the opportunity I think, for our technologists here and the scale, that's really the gravy because most engineers, that's what they want, from an engineering perspective. I want to ship code at scale. Laurel: It's possible some people may be surprised how big a team is, so you're talking about data, design, customer service, as well as product managers, as well as your actual software developers. So with this, you actually have to invest in a collaborative and purpose-driven culture. And that seems to be certainly something that draws you to this organization, but it also creates an attractive workplace that can develop and retain talent. As you said, that is building that purpose-driven company for the customers themselves. So, why are you passionate about this idea of purpose-driven culture and what are the benefits that you're seeing every day? Gill: Yeah, as a purpose-driven company, it's more than just the services that we provide when you think about technology. We're making differences in communities. Because money is central to people's lives, when we make a difference in our mobile app, that's huge. But also we have a large branch network and many people still use us through branches, and if we can be your community bank and we're able to help a family or help a small business, that makes a difference. If we're able to help a large company that is working on investing in some new electric vehicle type technology, we're the ones that are helping change the world in a positive way, and the list goes on. That sense of purpose is what really attracts people to the organization. But we also recognize and are passionate about diversity in general. We know that diverse teams are more innovative, more productive, more effective. You name the thing that teams' ought to be, and diverse teams are that way. We spend a good deal of time ensuring that we are focused on diversity, whether it is internally and how we ensure that you can be your whole self and bring your whole self to work, to the communities that we help. These are the things that really are meaningful and drive a difference for the people that work here. So, that's why people want to come and work here because you make a difference every single day. Laurel: There's obviously an incredible demand for developers and other software and IT professionals across every industry, including banking. So, how are you specifically addressing this challenge and what is JPMorgan Chase doing that is different from competitors? Gill: Tech is not an afterthought. It is in everything that we do. This is from our offices, to our branches, to our contact centers, to our web and mobile applications. It is a core in our purpose. When people look at our organization, they should see that is what we do on a daily basis. In 2021, we hired thousands of software engineers with skill sets that range across full stack development, cloud, data science, machine learning, and engineering. You name the technology, we've invested in it. Now, the market is incredibly hot, and one of the things that we focus on is making sure that when we bring people in, that you are coming here for a career. You're not coming here just for a job. There's training. We do bring people in at entry level, and we put you through training, so you learn how to work in our environment. We also provide additional mobility and opportunity within the organization, so that you are learning, and you are growing. That is another attractive point. Our push for diversity. It's a welcoming culture. You work with people from different walks of life and backgrounds. All of that just make it a really enjoyable place to be. We recognize that attitude and aptitude make the difference. So that's what we are looking for in the talent that we bring in. We're looking for that really incredible talent that wants to change the world, because we're at the center of what everyone does on a daily basis. We're hiring across the country. We're hiring across the world, honestly, Laurel. We have our career page that people can visit, at careers.jpmorganchase.com. The thing that is just really passionate to us is we are focused on being a technology company in the sense of how we build software. We're moving to building our software in a truly DevOps fashion. You build your software, you test your software, you deploy your software, you manage your software in your agile team. We're operating in a way where we can release software more and more all the time. If you name the cloud provider, we're there, and if you name the technology, we are thinking about that technology or using that technology. Because we also deploy it at scale, it's one thing to say, ""I'm using the cloud,"" or, ""I built a mobile application."" It's another to use those technologies for 60 million customers on a regular basis. That is not just incredibly challenging from the user experience, but even the back-end of the plumbing and how we rethink or reimagine how we provide the foundational services to make that happen. Those sorts of things are really attractive to engineers. It's what gets me and the people here excited, too. That's the thing that we believe is really drawing people to the organization. Laurel: Delivering services at scale clearly is important and also, as you said, one of those attractive features. But what is it about the banking industry that makes it so appealing to technologists? Gill: When I was first approached to join a bank, Laurel, with full transparency, I said what I thought most technologists typically are thinking: ""A bank. I don't want to join a bank. I want to join a technology company."" I know I gave a bit about what a technology company is and how I think we are a technology company. When you think about banking and you think about the technology that we have, we employ technology at great scale. So, the first part is, in order to deliver the services we have, there's no way we can't be using technology. But what really makes a technology company is how you think about the way you hire teams, the way that you groom teams, the way that you build your software, the way that you deploy that software, as I mentioned. It's the way that you manage that software production. It's how you organize around products, not around your business units. It's how you obsess over the customer experience. That is what we are doing at JPMorgan Chase. And when you think about the technology problems we're solving, the way that we are solving them, there's no better place to be because we are moving from many heritage technologies into modern, cloud-based technologies. We're rebuilding, re-plumbing our entire deposit platform in a cloud-native manner. That is something that drives trillions of dollars of our deposits. And we'll be moving that to a modern ecosystem that we deploy on a regular basis, in a controlled, well-managed way. This is incredibly exciting. It's exhilarating actually, when I talk about it. We make the difference in people's lives. People ask if we are really committed to this sort of change. We spend for JPMorgan, $12 billion on technology annually. In my division, $4 billion alone. So, there's one thing for all the words that I've used on what we're doing, but also we're putting our money where our mouth is, which is incredible. Laurel: And you've mentioned some of those technologies that you're investing in, like machine learning, artificial intelligence, microservices and all of these technologies drive that product development and digital engagement for customers. Looking forward, what are you thinking about for the future of banking and the banking technology? Gill: There are a few areas where I think the future is. One is collaboration in general across our various business units. One of the reasons we're doing this transformation and we're really modernizing how we operate, is to move—and I'll use API as an example—but to enable our teams to be able to innovate at pace beyond just their local division. Organizing around our product teams makes it easier for us to build those products. By also ensuring that we have APIs and the data that is accessible across those teams, teams can innovate and explore in a truly agile fashion, which is empowering our engineers and designers, data, etc., to be able to do things they once couldn't do. I think you're going to see more of this happening, where I can use elements of data or a service from other portions of the bank within my mobile app that make for a more compelling experience for our customers. But I think the other part of the future of banking really is personalization. We know that you just booked a trip. We can make other recommendations while you're making that booking. If we see a flight is delayed, we can act immediately. If we identify that you have a big inflow of money, we can help you when it comes to, in real time, tell you where you could be spending that money more effectively, what you should be saving. The list goes on with the kinds of experiences we can create. And they're not just limited to our mobile or web app, but it's across our whole ecosystem. When you're in a branch, that kind of data can tell us, I know that you've called us about other types of products, or I saw you perform some experience on our mobile application, and we could tie it all together to a truly personalized experience where you're a customer of one, and that's a really incredible future, I think. There’s also just a little bit of the road less traveled. We know there are going to be things that we need to do or technologies that we haven't really tapped yet. You can see that happening on a regular basis. That's why we are always on the search for the best technologists in the industry and what we have our technologists doing here, which is what have we not unlocked yet. Because there are definitely things that we know we're going to need to do in the future. We're not looking for people that know how to do everything today. We're looking for those who are curious and want to know and are willing to learn, ""Okay, how do I need to do this in the future?"" Because all the things I just recommended, I'm sure there will be something even well beyond that in the coming years. The other part of the future is diversity. I mentioned before that diverse and inclusive teams are just better teams. We know that by science, not just anecdote, and we want this to be that sort of place. We want our teams to be that way. We want an environment where everybody brings their whole self to work. I think you're going to see that more and more, not just here, but even more broadly. It's important, because I do think that it is a secret sauce to how we develop products, because remember, the millions of customers that we have, they are also diverse. It doesn't matter who you are and so our people should reflect those people we serve so we can make better products, can understand our customers more. And that I think is extremely exciting to me on what I think the future of banking holds in store. Laurel: Excellent. Thank you Gill, for joining us today on the Business Lab. Gill: My pleasure, thank you for having me. Laurel: That was Gill Haus, who is a chief information officer for consumer and community banking at JPMorgan Chase, who I spoke to from Cambridge, Massachusetts, the home of MIT and MIT Technology Review, overlooking the Charles River.

A heritage financial services institution isn’t necessarily the first place a technologist looks to grow their career. But that hasn’t been a problem for JPMorgan Chase, which has made itself an appealing career destination for technologists. “Technology is not an afterthought,” says Gill Haus, chief information officer of consumer and community banking at JPMorgan Chase. “It is in everything we do, from our offices to our branches to our contact centers to our web and mobile applications.” Haus explains that there’s more to being a technology company than using technology to solve problems. “What really makes a technology company is how you think about the way you hire teams, the way you groom teams, the way you build software, the way you deploy that software,” says Haus. “It's how you organize around products, not around your business units.” Like a technology startup, the technical teams at JPMorgan Chase solve real-world problems. “Every single day, we are launching new features and products that make it easier for everyone. It's incredibly exciting,” says Haus. However, unlike a startup, JPMorgan Chase has scale. The financial services institution supports 44 million mobile active customers and 59 million digitally active customers in general. The company spends $12 billion on technology annually. “When we launch a solution or bring a new product to market, we don't bring it to market for 1,000 people. We don't bring it to market for a 100,000 people. We bring it to market for millions of customers immediately, and that is incredible,” says Haus. “There's incredible talent here, as you can imagine, because we have such a technical need. Talent begets talent. It's exciting to go to a place where you know you're going to be challenged.” Laurel Ruma: From MIT Technology Review, I'm Laurel Ruma and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace. Our topic today is innovation at scale. Established institutions in every industry have found themselves competing against cloud-born startups that run lean and mean. Legacy companies must not only innovate, but do so on a significantly larger scale than the current generation and much faster to maintain that scale in a rapidly changing marketplace. But success is possible. Two words for you. Scaling innovation. My guest today is Gill Haus, who is the chief information officer of consumer and community banking at JPMorgan Chase. Gill heads the Chase technology team, and is a member of both the consumer and community banking leadership team, and the firm's global technology leadership team. This podcast is produced in association with JPMorgan Chase. Welcome, Gill. Gill Haus: Thank you for having me, Laurel. Laurel: You've worked at a number of different companies, including PayPal and Curb, which is formerly known as RideCharge. What's it like working at a large financial institution after being at several fintechs? And why did you join JPMorgan Chase? Gill: I'll answer it in reverse, which is what led me to come to a company like a JPMorgan Chase. There is a size and a scale that is incredibly attractive, particularly given the technology challenges that we face. To put it in perspective, we have 44 million digitally active mobile customers and 59 million digitally active customers in general. Getting the experience right for them, making it load quickly, showing all the information their customer needs in a secure way, that's a technical masterpiece, and that's exciting for me and that's why I joined a firm like this. That's just the Chase portion of the business, not to mention our corporate and investment bank and other parts of our organization. There's also incredible talent here, as you can imagine, because of the fact that we have such a technical need. Talent begets talent. It's exciting to go to a place where you know that you're going to be challenged. You're going to learn from other people. But also, there's a culture. This one's important and it goes to the first part of your question. There's a culture here of, “We can tackle these problems. We are a startup on our own.” We look at any of the challenges facing us, whether it is in our consumer business, whether it's in our asset wealth management business, whether it's in investment international, and we look at each of those problems the way that a startup would. So, it feels very much like a startup here, like when I was at PayPal or Curb or other companies. The difference is we have the scale, so we have the resources at our disposal should we need them. We have the money to actually be able to make a difference. I do love startups having been there, but unlike some startups, when we launch a solution or bring some new product to market, we don't bring it to market for 1,000 people. We don't bring it to market for 100,000 people. We bring that to market for millions of customers immediately, and that is incredible. The other piece of this, which is really great about a startup, is purpose. A lot of the places that I joined when I was at a startup was because we're going to change the world. We're going to change ride share, which is why I joined Curb. At PayPal we were acquired, but it was about changing how money is used. The purpose that we have here at JPMorgan Chase is incredible because finance is at the center of everyone's life. There's nothing more personal than finance. Whether it is an individual customer, a small business, or a corporation or a government, money is so incredibly important. Every single day, we are launching new features and products that make it easier for everyone. It's incredibly exciting. The technical challenge is huge and that's why it feels a lot like a startup almost every single day, but also why I joined the organization. Laurel: You started as the head of digital technology and probably much like a startup, you moved along quite quickly to lead Chase's technology organization as CIO. How has your role changed? And what advice would you give to technologists who might actually follow that career path? Gill: If you had asked me years ago, “Do you want to be a CIO, whether it's here or anywhere else?” I don't know Laurel, if I would've said yes. And now that I know, I might go like, ""What, really? I don't know."" But what really kept me moving in my career were a few things. The first was the technology itself. I've always been passionate about technology. The roles that I've had have been on solving technical problems and having a curiosity and being technical. Now, I'm not as hands-on as I once was, but I do read constantly about technology. I get into the architecture, and I've done that throughout my career. That's an important thing too, because I believe that anyone that wants to be a CIO or a CTO, particularly in the way that the industry is progressing, you need to understand technology. So, staying close to the technology and curious and wanting to solve those problems has helped me. But there's another part to it, too. In every one of my roles, there have been times when I've seen something that wasn't necessarily working and I had ideas and wanted to help, but it might’ve been outside of my responsibility. I've always leaned in to help, even though I knew that it was going to help someone else in the organization, because it was the right thing to do and it helped the company, it helped other people. So, it ended up building stronger relationships, but also building my skillset. I think that's been a part of my rise too, and it's something that's just incredibly powerful from a cultural perspective. That’s something that I love here. Everybody is in it together to work that way. But I also think that it just speaks volumes about an individual, and people gravitate to want to work with people that operate that way. The reality is we all need help and there have been so many people that have done that for me in my career, and I either hire them or they've hired me and we stay close. So, that's been something else has been important in my career path. The last piece that I would say is, it's important to have two things. There is one, the excitement about the work. And I have that here. I had it in my last role here too, which is there's an excitement about the changes you're making every day, about the problem set and the technologies that we can use and the opportunity. That's really important because that ensures that you're always going to be excited, even if there's a bad day. The other thing that I make sure of is, am I a bit scared? Not scared like something bad is going to happen, but more scared like, can I do it? Do I understand how the technology works? Do I know how to navigate this situation? Having that means you're going to grow and you're going to learn skills you didn't learn before. So you won't get bored because you can get excited, and after a while the excitement wanes, but you still are really jazzed about the things that you're learning. I urge people to find roles where they have both of those challenges. If you have a cultural view of, I'm going to try to solve the problems and it's bigger than me, it's about the company, and I'm going to put myself in a situation that I'm having fun, you'll have energy. And I'm also a little bit scared, you're going to learn. That's the best way, I think, to grow someone's career. And what's so exciting here is we have so many awesome problems to solve, so many incredible people that are looking for assistance, that you just have an environment where people can grow their careers really quickly. I was surprised that I became CIO so quickly, but you can point to so many examples in this company where people that bring the attitude, the aptitude, the skill and the passion, they continue to grow because we're doing some incredible things, and we respect and we value that in our leaders. Laurel: Speaking of problem solving, for a lot of organizations, the pandemic accelerated digital transformation initiatives out of necessity. Perhaps some organizations had a five-year plan to roll out video collaboration solutions for remote work, but suddenly they had to make that a priority when everyone was home for the pandemic. Where was JPMorgan Chase in its digital transformation journey in early 2020, and did you feel the need to accelerate any initiatives to get through that pandemic? Gill: I'm smiling because I joined JPMC on March second of 2020, so it was right before we went into lockdown. I got to see the before and the after really quickly. One of the things that was incredibly apparent then and continues to be apparent is that our customer is our number one focus. That has always been the case and COVID didn't change that. In fact, it was a rallying call for the organization, that we need to make sure even more so, that we're doing right for our customers because our customers were unable to visit branches or perform the services they were used to. And they were also impacted by the pandemic themselves on their finances, etc. So, it was super clear about the mission we had here, even more so, we want to make sure that we're helping those that really depend on us. You could see it in the way that everyone rallied around solving problems. There were some things that the pandemic also drove. There was an increase in digital engagement. That would've probably happened anywhere to your point about a five-year plan, but that was fast-tracked because people were at home, and they needed to transact, and they used their digital devices because there was no other way. I believe that's here to stay and that digital adoption, that acceleration, we're seeing it because we are up 6% year over year. If you think about our digitally active customers, so 58.8 million customers. I mentioned the mobile number, we're up 11% year over year. That's something that we're continuing to see happen. Once you're using our mobile, or you're using web, it's hard to necessarily go back, but you still can. It required us to roll out video conferencing globally to our employees in a span of a weekend, which is not for the faint of heart. When you think about the 200,000 employees that we have, we were able to roll this out at that pace, which speaks not just to the technical powers we have more broadly in the firm, but to how adaptable we are when these sorts of things occur. That was all because we wanted to make sure that our people could service our customers the best way that we could. Remember, we have people that work in our call centers, and they were impacted, and we have people that work in branches, and they're impacted, etc. One of the things that was really clear when the pandemic occurred was how quickly our teams could deploy new software. Many talk about being able to build quickly and being agile. There's the Paycheck Protection Program, and this was the ability to offer small businesses who were not having as much traffic, etc., loans through the government. We had about a week to put this in place, and we were able to stand up that portal in about a week. We had it fully automated in a matter of two-ish weeks, and we were able to provide more funding than any other lender in both 2020 and 2021, which was just incredible. The fact that we were able to build that because of the technology we've invested in over the past years, build that so quickly and scale that to such a large volume for our customers was huge. But we also were able to make some fundamental changes in mobile. We were able to enhance things which might seem simple. We have a product inside of our mobile application called QuickDeposit, and this is where you're able to deposit a check. But as many know, sometimes checks are large numbers. Traditionally we asked people to go into branches to help prevent fraud. Because of the technology that we have, we were able to raise limits in a way that ensured that we were able to manage through fraud appropriately and allow customers that would have formerly had to come into a branch or ATM, make the deposits electronically. Those are the kinds of things that we've seen change, but the pace that we moved, that's not just limited to the Chase part of the business, but we saw this across all of J.P. Morgan. There’s one piece that I think is important on this Laurel. I was in a meeting and here I am a new person in the organization working on the Paycheck Protection Program. I recall there being somebody on Zoom. We were having a conversation and I assumed because I was new and they were in the meeting that they were on my team, and the person said, ""Oh no, I'm not on your team, but I know you're new and you needed assistance. And so here I am to help, and I just figured I'd navigate."" And that has stuck with me about the culture of this organization and how we focus on the customer both externally and internally, to really make sure that we are providing the best service that we possibly can. Laurel: That certainly requires an agile mindset. So, how is JPMorgan Chase transforming into an agile organization? You've laid a couple examples. Clearly you would not have been able to respond to the US government's Payroll Protection Act that quickly if you hadn't been already working on a number of these opportunities and abilities to be more agile. So, what lessons have you learned along the way and how have your teams and customers benefited from this shift? Gill: Oh, yes. An agile transformation is a really hard thing to do. Many people are making agile transformations, so it sounds like it should be easy. You have your scrums, and you have your various ceremonies and retrospectives, and you use a tool to manage your backlog and you're golden. One of the big challenges that we as a company had faced in JPMorgan, was we were organized more around our software and platforms than around our customer and the experiences back. That made it really frustrating for teams because it meant that you likely needed 10, maybe 12 different organizations to agree on building something. It wasn't clear who the owner was. The architectures sometimes would be a bit more frail because you were working through multiple teams. If you want to move quickly or you want to innovate, that's not a model in which you're able to actually operate. You can force it, but it requires many more meetings. It's difficult to know who the decision makers are. You can move more slowly and sometimes an application or a solution looks like many teams built it. There's Conway's Law, and you may have probably mentioned this before on other podcasts, but Dr. Conway said that your software will reflect how you're organized. That's really what we had seen. So, as opposed to us just trying to find a way to navigate around it, we said as an organization, “We're truly going to become agile, and we're going to accept Conway's Law, and we're going to organize around our products back.” In the community and consumer bank, we organized around 100 products, so we have a thousand teams that are aligned around these products. A product, for example, is something like account opening. So, I want to open an account on mobile or web. There is one product for this. There is one product leader, one design leader, one data leader, and one technology leader that are accountable for that product. Now we know who can manage the backlog. Now we know who can work through any kind of architectural decisions. Now we understand who is accountable for ensuring that we have innovation and understanding that customer needs. That has allowed us to pivot quickly, because if I need to move, I can work with the account opening team, they can make the decisions, they can manage a backlog, and they're able to adapt when we have things like the Paycheck Protection Program or other types of efforts that are out there. But it also gives more purpose to the individual teams because they set their destiny, they have more autonomy, and they're working together between tech and product design and data, so we can build the right solutions that we need. This creates a great experience for people in the organization. By the way, the whole of JPMC is moving to operate this way. This lets us not just move more quickly, it gives better work life balance for our employees and less frustration, because it's easier to know where you are. You have that purpose and you accept being part of a particular team. I mentioned we can respond more quickly when there is a challenge, but it's not just those challenges like PPP or a pandemic that we have to address, Laurel. There are places where our customer's needs are changing every single day. And by organizing around products this way, we can understand the data from our customers, and we can experiment, and we can adapt in a truly agile fashion for what our customers really need, versus what we think they might need and building something that doesn't really resonate with them. It allows us to operate in a truly agile fashion, which we were not able to do before and it's quite incredible being able to make a change like this at such scale. Laurel: With those hundreds of products and millions of customers, what are some of the challenges and opportunities that your teams face when operating on this scale? Gill: We are a company, so it's a job. And there are going to be the normal things that you would see in a company, which is we have to prioritize. We're like any other company in that respect. However, working here, in my opinion, is incredible. When you write code in this organization, you are deploying it at scale. The problems that we are solving that could be frustrating because it could be a day where this code isn't working or I'm running into this blocker, I can't figure it out or, I have to support some other change that's occurred — when we make those changes for our engineers, for our product, our design, our data leaders, we are deploying this at scale. The other part is we include the feedback from our millions upon millions of customers to improve an experience and improve the life of those customers. That's something that keeps me going every single day. Yeah, I might feel like this project's been a bit harder than it should have been. However, the difference that I'm making for a customer on every single day is tangible. Somebody buying groceries for their family, somebody buying their first car, somebody refinancing their house, you name it -- the list goes on. Because the work that's being done every single day is making that positive impact, I just feel incredible about it and I think everyone else in the organization does, too. This is the kind of thing that makes me excited about being here. Even if there is a challenge on a particular day. Now, there are things we want to do. We want to deliver software more quickly, and we're constantly working on improving in that space. We have a ton of products that we continue to improve, but that's the opportunity, which is we have thousands of engineers. We hire thousands of designers. And every day we're making it better, but we're also learning. And that's the career opportunity for people because what you join the company to do today, could be something different that you do in a year. That's exciting because what we learn to do in one of our other divisions, we go, ""That's wonderful, bring that over."" Career opportunity, mobility opportunity. And it's a career mindset every single day for people that's exciting and that's the opportunity I think, for our technologists here and the scale, that's really the gravy because most engineers, that's what they want, from an engineering perspective. I want to ship code at scale. Laurel: It's possible some people may be surprised how big a team is, so you're talking about data, design, customer service, as well as product managers, as well as your actual software developers. So with this, you actually have to invest in a collaborative and purpose-driven culture. And that seems to be certainly something that draws you to this organization, but it also creates an attractive workplace that can develop and retain talent. As you said, that is building that purpose-driven company for the customers themselves. So, why are you passionate about this idea of purpose-driven culture and what are the benefits that you're seeing every day? Gill: Yeah, as a purpose-driven company, it's more than just the services that we provide when you think about technology. We're making differences in communities. Because money is central to people's lives, when we make a difference in our mobile app, that's huge. But also we have a large branch network and many people still use us through branches, and if we can be your community bank and we're able to help a family or help a small business, that makes a difference. If we're able to help a large company that is working on investing in some new electric vehicle type technology, we're the ones that are helping change the world in a positive way, and the list goes on. That sense of purpose is what really attracts people to the organization. But we also recognize and are passionate about diversity in general. We know that diverse teams are more innovative, more productive, more effective. You name the thing that teams' ought to be, and diverse teams are that way. We spend a good deal of time ensuring that we are focused on diversity, whether it is internally and how we ensure that you can be your whole self and bring your whole self to work, to the communities that we help. These are the things that really are meaningful and drive a difference for the people that work here. So, that's why people want to come and work here because you make a difference every single day. Laurel: There's obviously an incredible demand for developers and other software and IT professionals across every industry, including banking. So, how are you specifically addressing this challenge and what is JPMorgan Chase doing that is different from competitors? Gill: Tech is not an afterthought. It is in everything that we do. This is from our offices, to our branches, to our contact centers, to our web and mobile applications. It is a core in our purpose. When people look at our organization, they should see that is what we do on a daily basis. In 2021, we hired thousands of software engineers with skill sets that range across full stack development, cloud, data science, machine learning, and engineering. You name the technology, we've invested in it. Now, the market is incredibly hot, and one of the things that we focus on is making sure that when we bring people in, that you are coming here for a career. You're not coming here just for a job. There's training. We do bring people in at entry level, and we put you through training, so you learn how to work in our environment. We also provide additional mobility and opportunity within the organization, so that you are learning, and you are growing. That is another attractive point. Our push for diversity. It's a welcoming culture. You work with people from different walks of life and backgrounds. All of that just make it a really enjoyable place to be. We recognize that attitude and aptitude make the difference. So that's what we are looking for in the talent that we bring in. We're looking for that really incredible talent that wants to change the world, because we're at the center of what everyone does on a daily basis. We're hiring across the country. We're hiring across the world, honestly, Laurel. We have our career page that people can visit, at careers.jpmorganchase.com. The thing that is just really passionate to us is we are focused on being a technology company in the sense of how we build software. We're moving to building our software in a truly DevOps fashion. You build your software, you test your software, you deploy your software, you manage your software in your agile team. We're operating in a way where we can release software more and more all the time. If you name the cloud provider, we're there, and if you name the technology, we are thinking about that technology or using that technology. Because we also deploy it at scale, it's one thing to say, ""I'm using the cloud,"" or, ""I built a mobile application."" It's another to use those technologies for 60 million customers on a regular basis. That is not just incredibly challenging from the user experience, but even the back-end of the plumbing and how we rethink or reimagine how we provide the foundational services to make that happen. Those sorts of things are really attractive to engineers. It's what gets me and the people here excited, too. That's the thing that we believe is really drawing people to the organization. Laurel: Delivering services at scale clearly is important and also, as you said, one of those attractive features. But what is it about the banking industry that makes it so appealing to technologists? Gill: When I was first approached to join a bank, Laurel, with full transparency, I said what I thought most technologists typically are thinking: ""A bank. I don't want to join a bank. I want to join a technology company."" I know I gave a bit about what a technology company is and how I think we are a technology company. When you think about banking and you think about the technology that we have, we employ technology at great scale. So, the first part is, in order to deliver the services we have, there's no way we can't be using technology. But what really makes a technology company is how you think about the way you hire teams, the way that you groom teams, the way that you build your software, the way that you deploy that software, as I mentioned. It's the way that you manage that software production. It's how you organize around products, not around your business units. It's how you obsess over the customer experience. That is what we are doing at JPMorgan Chase. And when you think about the technology problems we're solving, the way that we are solving them, there's no better place to be because we are moving from many heritage technologies into modern, cloud-based technologies. We're rebuilding, re-plumbing our entire deposit platform in a cloud-native manner. That is something that drives trillions of dollars of our deposits. And we'll be moving that to a modern ecosystem that we deploy on a regular basis, in a controlled, well-managed way. This is incredibly exciting. It's exhilarating actually, when I talk about it. We make the difference in people's lives. People ask if we are really committed to this sort of change. We spend for JPMorgan, $12 billion on technology annually. In my division, $4 billion alone. So, there's one thing for all the words that I've used on what we're doing, but also we're putting our money where our mouth is, which is incredible. Laurel: And you've mentioned some of those technologies that you're investing in, like machine learning, artificial intelligence, microservices and all of these technologies drive that product development and digital engagement for customers. Looking forward, what are you thinking about for the future of banking and the banking technology? Gill: There are a few areas where I think the future is. One is collaboration in general across our various business units. One of the reasons we're doing this transformation and we're really modernizing how we operate, is to move—and I'll use API as an example—but to enable our teams to be able to innovate at pace beyond just their local division. Organizing around our product teams makes it easier for us to build those products. By also ensuring that we have APIs and the data that is accessible across those teams, teams can innovate and explore in a truly agile fashion, which is empowering our engineers and designers, data, etc., to be able to do things they once couldn't do. I think you're going to see more of this happening, where I can use elements of data or a service from other portions of the bank within my mobile app that make for a more compelling experience for our customers. But I think the other part of the future of banking really is personalization. We know that you just booked a trip. We can make other recommendations while you're making that booking. If we see a flight is delayed, we can act immediately. If we identify that you have a big inflow of money, we can help you when it comes to, in real time, tell you where you could be spending that money more effectively, what you should be saving. The list goes on with the kinds of experiences we can create. And they're not just limited to our mobile or web app, but it's across our whole ecosystem. When you're in a branch, that kind of data can tell us, I know that you've called us about other types of products, or I saw you perform some experience on our mobile application, and we could tie it all together to a truly personalized experience where you're a customer of one, and that's a really incredible future, I think. There’s also just a little bit of the road less traveled. We know there are going to be things that we need to do or technologies that we haven't really tapped yet. You can see that happening on a regular basis. That's why we are always on the search for the best technologists in the industry and what we have our technologists doing here, which is what have we not unlocked yet. Because there are definitely things that we know we're going to need to do in the future. We're not looking for people that know how to do everything today. We're looking for those who are curious and want to know and are willing to learn, ""Okay, how do I need to do this in the future?"" Because all the things I just recommended, I'm sure there will be something even well beyond that in the coming years. The other part of the future is diversity. I mentioned before that diverse and inclusive teams are just better teams. We know that by science, not just anecdote, and we want this to be that sort of place. We want our teams to be that way. We want an environment where everybody brings their whole self to work. I think you're going to see that more and more, not just here, but even more broadly. It's important, because I do think that it is a secret sauce to how we develop products, because remember, the millions of customers that we have, they are also diverse. It doesn't matter who you are and so our people should reflect those people we serve so we can make better products, can understand our customers more. And that I think is extremely exciting to me on what I think the future of banking holds in store. Laurel: Excellent. Thank you Gill, for joining us today on the Business Lab.

Google examines how different generations handle misinformation,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/11/1057552/gen-z-misinformation/,2022-08-11,"<p>A new survey by Google shows Gen Z is better than millennials or boomers at fact-checking—but previous research tells a different story.</p>
","A habit called “lateral reading” is a core part of any good fact-checking routine. It means opening up a bunch of tabs and doing multiple searches to verify the facts, source, or claims made in a piece of online information. So it seemed like great news when a new study from Poynter, YouGov, and Google indicated that Generation Z is adopting this technique more than any previous generation.  The study, released today by Google as the search engine team there rolls out several changes to how it handles misinformation, asked more than 8,000 people ranging in age from Generation Z (defined for this study as those 18 to 25) to the Silent Generation (68+), across seven countries, about misinformation and how they research questionable content online.  Essentially, the study concludes that younger people are more likely to think they may have unintentionally shared false or misleading information—often driven by the pressure to share emotional content quickly. However, they are also more adept at using advanced fact-checking techniques.  One-third of Gen Z respondents said they practice lateral reading always or most of the time when verifying information—more than double the percentage of boomers. About a third of younger people also said they run searches on multiple search engines to compare results, and go past the first page of search results.  Portions of the survey provide an interesting snapshot of how people of different ages, and in different locations, experience misinformation and think about their own role in stopping or spreading it: 62% of all respondents believe they see misinformation online every week, for instance. Gen Z, millennial, and Gen X readers are more confident in their ability to spot misinformation and more concerned that their close family and friends might believe something misleading online.  However, the study relies on participants to accurately report their own beliefs and habits. And the optimistic figures about Gen Z’s actual habits contrast pretty starkly with other findings on how people verify information online.  Sam Wineburg, a Stanford University professor who studies fact-checking practices, thinks he knows why that might be: when you’re trying to understand how people actually behave on the internet, “self-report,” he says, “is bullshit.”  After boosting unproven covid drugs and campaigning against vaccines, Steve Kirsch was abandoned by his team of scientific advisers—and left out of a job. “What people say they do versus what they do do?” he adds. “That discrepancy goes back to the earliest days of social psychology.” His own research has found that without intervention, younger people seldom use lateral reading or other advanced fact-checking techniques on their own.   In one recent study led by Wineburg and his team at Stanford, researchers wanted to learn whether an online course in fact-checking techniques could improve how college students verify information. Before the course, just three of the 87 students they tested engaged in lateral reading, meaning in this case that they left the website they were asked to evaluate to consult an outside source.  “If people spontaneously did [lateral reading], we’d all be in a lot better shape,” Wineburg said.  In a larger study, more than 3,000 high school students were asked to investigate a series of online claims. The results were pretty bleak: more than half the students tested believed that an anonymous Facebook video filmed in Russia contained “strong evidence” of US voter fraud. (Full disclosure: I was a participant in an earlier study from Wineburg’s team that observed the methods of fact checkers and compared them with those used by historians and Stanford undergraduates.)  Gen Z clearly uses the internet differently from previous generations. But young people are also susceptible to the same traps, weaponized misinformation tactics, and pressure to share that have fueled bad online practices for years.  ","A habit called “lateral reading” is a core part of any good fact-checking routine.

"Software can do better than ‘male,’ ‘female,’ and ‘other’",https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/22/1057853/software-coding-more-gender-options/,2022-08-22,"<p>Providing more-expansive gender options is not a difficult coding problem.</p>
","For transgender and nonbinary people like me, a society organized into only “male” and “female” makes us feel excluded. And it’s something that happens frequently, especially online. Take Gmail. There are three gender options when you register. If you choose “other,” you can write in any gender identity. But first you must choose how you’d like Google to refer to you—as “male,” “female,” or “other.”  Why something as dehumanizing as “other”? Even a choice of the three most popular—“he,” “she,” and “they”—would be reasonable. From a coding perspective, it would be quite simple to update the dropdown language. It should not be difficult for companies to improve gender inclusivity on existing forms. Providing additional options often requires just changing or adding a few lines of code. Here’s what it would look like to add a third gender category in PHP, which is used to program many web forms: Of course, not all software is easy to update.

","For transgender and nonbinary people like me, a society organized into only “male” and “female” makes us feel excluded. And it’s something that happens frequently, especially online. Take Gmail. There are three gender options when you register. If you choose “other,” you can write in any gender identity. But first you must choose how you’d like Google to refer to you—as “male,” “female,” or “other.” Why something as dehumanizing as “other”? Even a choice of the three most popular—“he,” “she,” and “they”—would be reasonable. From a coding perspective, it would be quite simple to update the dropdown language. It should not be difficult for companies to improve gender inclusivity on existing forms. Providing additional options often requires just changing or adding a few lines of code. Here’s what it would look like to add a third gender category in PHP, which is used to program many web forms: Of course, not all software is easy to update.

Erik Prince wants to sell you a “secure” smartphone that’s too good to be true,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/19/1058243/erik-prince-wants-to-sell-you-a-secure-smartphone-thats-too-good-to-be-true/,2022-08-19,"<p>MIT Technology Review obtained Prince’s investor presentation for the “RedPill Phone,” which promises more than it could possibly deliver.</p>
","Erik Prince’s pitch to investors was simple—but certainly ambitious: pay just €5 million and cure the biggest cybersecurity and privacy plagues of our day.  The American billionaire—best known for founding the notorious private military firm Blackwater, which became globally infamous for killing Iraqi civilians and threatening US government investigators—was pushing Unplugged, a smartphone startup promising “free speech, privacy, and security” untethered from dominant tech giants like Apple and Google.  In June, Prince publicly revealed the new phone, priced at $850. But before that, beginning in 2021, he was privately hawking the device to investors—using a previously unreported pitch deck that has been obtained by MIT Technology Review. It boldly claims that the phone and its operating system are “impenetrable” to surveillance, interception, and tampering, and its messenger service is marketed as “impossible to intercept or decrypt.”  Open-source code runs on every computer on the planet—and keeps America’s critical infrastructure going. DARPA is worried about how well it can be trusted Boasting falsely that Unplugged has built “the first operating system free of big tech monetization and analytics,” Prince bragged that the device is protected by “government-grade encryption.” Better yet, the pitch added, Unplugged is to be hosted on a global array of server farms so that it “can never be taken offline.” One option is said to be a server farm “on a vessel” located in an “undisclosed location on international waters, connected via satellite to Elon Musk’s StarLink.” An Unplugged spokesperson explained that ""they benefit in having servers not be subject to any governmental law."" The Unplugged investor pitch deck is a messy mix of these impossible claims, meaningless buzzwords, and outright fiction.  The product is the latest example in a decade-long tradition of privacy- and security-focused smartphones that promise to do far more than your Android or iPhone can to protect you and your data. Ever since Edward Snowden’s 2013 revelations about American spying, a new phone has popped up in this market at least once per year. The trend was already so prominent by 2014 that MIT Technology Review called “ultraprivate phones” one of the year’s technology breakthroughs. Well, mea culpa. Almost every attempt to build this kind of phone has failed. While none of the experts I spoke with had yet been able to test the phone or read its code, because the company hasn't provided access, the evidence available suggests Unplugged will fall wildly short of what's promised. “No device is impenetrable—that’s been proven over time,” says David Richardson, vice president at the mobile security firm Lookout.  A suspected North Korean heist of cryptocurrency only adds to an already long and growing list of big crypto hacks. The selling points of Unplugged’s device, known as the UP Phone, are built on enormous promises of security and privacy that go beyond what any phone can accomplish. Buzzwords like “government-grade encryption” imply some kind of heightened protection, but—as the company never mentions—governments use the same standard encryption as the rest of us. When asked about the phrase by MIT Technology Review, Unplugged acknowledged ""this messaging doesn't resonate well with our community"" and said they won't use it moving forward. “There are two things happening here,” says Allan Liska, a cyberintelligence analyst at the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future. “There are the actual attempts to make real secure phones, and then there is the marketing BS. Distinguishing between those two can be really hard.” Prince told investors the UP Phone is built by “engineers with deep experience in lawful interception, surveillance, and spoofing capabilities.”  While taking various privacy and security enhancements from open source projects, Unplugged president Ryan Paterson told MIT Technology Review via email, Unplugged's proprietary operating system developed their own ""enhancements"" including ""based on knowledge not available to the public (zero-days) and others."" A zero-day vulnerability is an unknown security weakness that can be attacked via exploit that can sell for millions of dollars. Unplugged’s day-to-day technology operations are run by Eran Karpen, a former employee of CommuniTake, the Israeli startup that gave rise to the now infamous hacker-for-hire firm NSO Group. There, Karpen built the IntactPhone, which the company called a “military-grade mobile device.” He’s also a veteran of Israel’s Unit 8200, an agency that conducts cyber espionage and is the country’s equivalent of the NSA.  But anyone with that experience should be able to see through Prince’s claim that the UP Phone is impossible to surveil. “When I worked in US intelligence, we [penetrated] a number of phone companies overseas,” says Liska. “We were inside those phone companies. We could easily track people based on where they connected to the towers. So when you talk about being impenetrable, that’s wrong.” “This is a phone, and the way that phones work is they triangulate to cell towers, and there is always latitude and longitude for exactly where you’re sitting,” he adds. “Nothing you do to the phone is going to change that.” The UP Phone’s operating system, called LibertOS, is a proprietary version of Google’s Android, according to an Unplugged spokesperson. It's running on an unclear mix of hardware that a company spokesperson says they've designed on their own. Even just maintaining a unique Android “fork”—a version of the operating system that departs from the original, like a fork in the road—is a difficult endeavor that can cost massive money and resources, experts warn. For a small startup, that can be an insurmountable challenge. “There's such a high volume of vulnerabilities that Android is disclosing and patching on an ongoing basis that you really do need to stay on top of all of those,” says Richardson. Keeping all the software and hardware compatible with every new version of Android is something that very few companies other than tech giants can effectively do. To deal with that, some niche phones simply don’t adopt new Android versions—a cheaper but more dangerous road. Another key issue is life span. Apple’s iPhones are considered the most secure consumer device on the market due in part to the fact that the company offers security updates to some of its older phones for six years, longer than virtually all competitors. When support for a phone ends, security vulnerabilities go unaddressed, and the phone is no longer secure. There is no information available on how long UP Phones will receive security support. Some other privacy phones are serious if imperfect products. The Librem 5, for example, is built by Purism, an American “social purpose corporation” specializing in privacy-oriented products. The phone is fully transparent and publishes source code and hardware details for anyone to see—unlike Unplugged, which has released precious few details next to its big promises. Librem is based on Linux, a free and open-source operating system that gives the lie to Prince’s false claim of being first to create an operating system outside Big Tech. Numerous commercially available phones have done this already. The Librem’s critical reception has been nuanced: reviewers have praised the phone’s ambition and details, as well as the relatively straightforward and honest marketing, a respectable feat in and of itself. (But, like so many Linux devices, it will appeal mostly to tech experts and people who can tolerate a significant learning curve.) GrapheneOS is another sober and credible project that has set out to deliver a secure, open-source, auditable operating system for Android phones.  Unplugged sits on the opposite end of this spectrum. The company’s claim that the phone is  “impenetrable” recalls the “hack-proof” phone that John McAfee, known for being accused of running a multimillion-dollar cryptocurrency fraud just before his death, tried to sell in 2017. Since it was publicly unveiled in June 2022, the Unplugged phone has become an object of skepticism and scorn among cybersecurity experts. “Words and phrases like ‘government-grade’ and ‘impenetrable’ are rightly mocked online by the computer security community because we know that they’re used to fool people,” says Nicholas Weaver, a cybersecurity researcher at the International Computer Science Institute.  Weaver believes the UP phone is not so much about the technology as it is about the perceived sales opportunity. “This is right-wing affinity fraud,” he argues.  In fact, the phone was originally called the “RedPill Phone,” a name based on a meme adored by the American far right. Prince is a vocal supporter of former president Donald Trump, and he debuted the phone on “War Room,” a podcast hosted by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon. Bannon and his fans got a discount code from the show.  It’s initially surprising, then, to see Prince pitch investors on the idea that the phone will appeal to “right wing and left wing alike.” But this offers a clue as to why Unplugged dropped the RedPill name.  Still, Prince may find a receptive audience in Bannon’s followers—which could matter greatly to the success of the phone. Its future will likely come down to how much customers believe in Prince and his claims.  “I think for the layperson, it comes down to trust,” says Kyle Rankin, president of Purism. “Does this vendor that’s selling you a phone require you to trust them to be secure? And then if so, are they worthy of that trust? It boils down to that.” The question of trust has long been a tricky one for many security and privacy phones. For example, the security firm DarkMatter, an incognito intelligence agency for the United Arab Emirates that has reportedly been busted hacking dissidents and journalists, marketed its own “ultrasecure” phone called the Katim beginning in 2018. The same year, a sleek black phone dubbed Anom was marketed specifically to people involved in organized crime, promising an “ultrasecure” device “hardened against targeted surveillance and intrusion.” In fact, however, the phone company was secretly run by the FBI.  Often the reasons for failure are simpler. The Blackphone, a security-first device that came out almost immediately after the Snowden leaks, is reported to have  quickly fallen millions of dollars into debt because of low sales. And that device was more than $200 less expensive than the UP Phone. In short, the market is littered with failure. Ambitions to build a more secure smartphone are noble. Claims that your phone is impenetrable are misleading at best and dangerous at worst. The UP Phone is due out in November 2022.

Inside the software that will become the next battle front in US-China chip war,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/18/1058116/eda-software-us-china-chip-war/,2022-08-18,"<p>The US has moved to restrict export of EDA software. What is it, and how will the move affect China?</p>
","Tech Review Explains: where our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you better understand the world we live in—and what comes next. The days when computer chips were designed by hand are long gone. Where chips contained thousands of transistors in the 1970s, they have more than a hundred billion today, and it’s impossible to create these designs manually. That’s where electronic design automation (EDA) software comes in. It’s a category of tools that help electrical engineers design and develop ever more complex chips.  This software now forms the latest battle front in the tech trade war between China and the United States. On August 12, the US Commerce Department announced a multilateral export control on certain EDA tools, blocking China and over 150 other countries—essentially any country that isn’t a traditional US ally—from accessing them without specially granted licenses.  EDA software is a small but mighty part of the semiconductor supply chain, and it’s mostly controlled by three Western companies. That gives the US a powerful point of leverage, similar to the way it wanted to restrict access to lithography machines—another crucial tool for chipmaking—last month. So how has the industry become so American-centric, and why can’t China just develop its own alternative software?  Electronic design automation (also known as electronic computer-aided design, or ECAD) is the specialized software used in chipmaking. It’s like the CAD software that architects use, except it’s more sophisticated, since it deals with billions of minuscule transistors on an integrated circuit. There’s no single dominant software program that represents the best in the industry. Instead, a series of software modules are often used throughout the whole design flow: logic design, debugging, component placement, wire routing, optimization of time and power consumption, verification, and more. Because modern-day chips are so complex, each step requires a different software tool.  Although the global EDA market was valued at only around $10 billion in 2021, making it a small fraction of the $595 billion semiconductor market, it’s of unique importance to the entire supply chain. The semiconductor ecosystem today can be seen as a triangle, says Mike Demler, a consultant who has been in the chip design and EDA industry for over 40 years. On one corner are the foundries, or chip manufacturers like TSMC; on another corner are intellectual-property companies like ARM, which make and sell reusable design units or layouts; and on the third corner are the EDA tools. All three together make sure the supply chain moves smoothly. From the name, it may sound as if EDA tools are only important to chip design firms, but they are also used by chip manufacturers to verify that a design is feasible before production. There’s no way for a foundry to make a single chip as a prototype; it has to invest in months of time and production, and each time, hundreds of chips are fabricated on the same semiconductor base. It would be an enormous waste if they were found to have design flaws. Therefore, manufacturers rely on a special type of EDA tool to do their own validation.  There are only a few companies that sell software for each step of the chipmaking process, and they have dominated this market for decades. The top three companies—Cadence (American), Synopsys (American), and Mentor Graphics (American but acquired by the German company Siemens in 2017)—control about 70% of the global EDA market. Their dominance is so strong that many EDA startups specialize in one niche use and then sell themselves to one of these three companies, further cementing the oligopoly.  US companies’ outsize influence on the EDA industry makes it easy for the US government to squeeze China’s access. In its latest announcement, it pledged to add certain EDA tools to its list of technologies banned from export. The US will coordinate with 41 other countries, including Germany, to implement these restrictions.  The restricted tools are those that can be used for GAAFET (gate-all-around field-effect transistor) architecture, the most advanced circuit structure today, which is critical to making the latest chips and more advanced ones in the future. The Commerce Department is still seeking public comment to identify which EDA software is most helpful in achieving this specific structure and therefore should be added to the list.  Chinese hardware giant Huawei was similarly restricted in 2019, losing access to all US EDA tools, and the Biden administration has continued the Trump administration’s preference for export controls as a trade war weapon. “Their previous round of restrictions on Huawei was so successful [that] they found this to be the track to pursue,” says Xiaomeng Lu, an analyst at the consultancy firm Eurasia Group. In the short term China won’t be that badly affected, because Chinese foundries are not advanced enough to make the state-of-the-art chips that need the GAAFET structure. But the blockade means Chinese chip design firms won’t be able to access the most advanced tools, and as time passes, they’ll most likely fall behind.  However, blocking the export of software is very different from blocking the export of bulky hardware like lithography machines, which are impossible to smuggle into China because they are so traceable. EDA software tools are distributed online, so they can be pirated.  Chinese companies could either hold on to the EDA software they have already purchased or resort to hacking licenses or acquiring them through shadow entities. That makes it harder to predict how effective this latest round of restrictions will be.  China has slowly realized that it needs to develop domestic alternatives. In its latest five-year plan, which is the country’s top economic blueprint, EDA was listed as the first cutting-edge technology within the semiconductor industry where China needs to make breakthroughs. This means more government resources will be put into R&D in this area, including China’s government-backed semiconductor investment fund, which invested in the Chinese EDA company Huada Empyrean in 2018. Huada Empyrean, whose founder has worked in EDA design since the 1980s, is the country’s current leader in domestic EDA software, but it only accounts for 6% of the domestic EDA market. It is also far from developing a whole design flow, meaning its product can only replace a small part of what American companies offer. There are more startups emerging to fill the gap, most of them led by former Chinese employees of Cadence or Synopsys, like Nanjing-based startup X-Epic and Shanghai-based Hejian Industrial Software. With more international experience and less historical burden, these startups may be better positioned to challenge the status quo, says Douglas Fuller, an associate professor at Copenhagen Business School. “In the longer term, if they cobbled them together, they could be a better alternative to Huada,” he says. China has a vibrant software industry, which has produced some world-famous consumer tech apps like Tencent’s WeChat and Alibaba’s Alipay. “But in terms of industrial-use, corporate-use software? That’s China’s drawback,” says Lu. “For the longest time, Chinese industrial policy makers didn't realize [EDA software] is the real bottleneck.”  It’s an area where it takes decades and billions of dollars of investment to make significant research advancements, so even though Chinese companies want to catch up now, it will take a long time before they make much progress. One big issue is talent. EDA tool development is such a niche field, and Chinese companies have traditionally struggled to attract many of the small numbers of engineers trained in making EDA tools. The latest EDA export control is targeted at a very specialized and advanced section of the industry. “This high-end software is not yet widely used by Chinese firms, so the restriction's immediate commercial impact on US suppliers is limited,” says Lu.  But export controls are generally not welcomed by chip companies, as such policies can reduce the demand for American products and therefore their income. This is true not just for EDA companies, but also the foundries, IP companies, equipment manufacturers, and everyone else on the supply chain. “You would have a lot of angry companies,” Fuller says. “Not only in the US—not just the EDA companies.”  ","Tech Review Explains: where our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you better understand the world we live in—and what comes next.

Hackers linked to China have been targeting human rights groups for years,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/16/1057894/hackers-linked-to-china-have-been-targeting-human-rights-groups-for-years/,2022-08-16,"<p>In a new report shared exclusively with MIT Technology Review, researchers expose a cyber-espionage campaign on “a tight budget” that proves simple can still be effective.</p>
","A hacking group linked to China has spent the last three years targeting human rights organizations, think tanks, news media, and agencies of multiple foreign governments, according to a revealing new report from the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.  The report, shared exclusively with MIT Technology Review, offers new clues about how private contractors and front companies operating with relatively few resources can run long-standing hacking operations and succeed against high-value targets with crude but effective tactics. By using private-sector hackers, experts say, the Chinese government gains the ability to hit more espionage targets—and frees up resources within intelligence and military agencies to carry out more advanced hacking. The operation also hints at a widespread and persistent failure among vulnerable institutions to implement even basic cybersecurity defenses. A decade-long quest to become a cyber superpower is paying off for China. The hackers, known as RedAlpha, have taken aim at organizations including Amnesty International, the International Federation for Human Rights, Radio Free Asia, the Mercator Institute for China Studies, and other think tanks and government and humanitarian groups around the world. The hackers’ impact remains unclear, but judging from the sheer length of the campaign, analysts expect that the digital espionage has, broadly speaking, seen success.  Recorded Future researchers have “high” confidence that RedAlpha is sponsored by the Chinese government as all of the targets “fall within [its] strategic interests,” says Jon Condra, director of the organization’s strategic threats team.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, the hacking group has over the past few years been particularly interested in organizations in Taiwan, including the Democratic Progressive Party and the American Institute in Taiwan, which is the de facto United States embassy in the small island democracy. The government in Beijing claims Taiwan as part of Chinese territory. RedAlpha has been active since at least 2015, though it wasn’t publicly identified until 2018, in a report by Citizen Lab. It has consistently targeted groups that the Chinese Communist Party calls the “five poisons”: Tibetans, Uyghurs, Taiwanese, democracy activists, and the Falun Gong. All of these include domestic dissidents who, for various reasons, criticize and challenge the Communist Party’s grip on China. They also share international visibility and support. Citizen Lab’s work first uncovered RedAlpha’s campaign against the Tibetan community, government agencies, and a media group. In the years since, Recorded Future has identified additional cyber campaigns against Tibetans, and last year a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers indicated that the group is expanding its focus to include individuals, vulnerable ethnic groups, civil society organizations, and a rising number of government agencies.  What’s particularly interesting about these new findings is that RedAlpha is still operating with the same simple and inexpensive playbook that it used years ago. In fact, this latest slate of espionage was linked to previous campaigns because the group reused many of the same domains, IP addresses, tactics, malware, and even domain registration information that has been publicly identified by cybersecurity experts for years. The Justice Department’s effort to prosecute cases of economic espionage had drifted from its stated mission and drawn fierce criticism for appearing to target researchers because of their ethnicity. “If it’s not broken, don’t change it,” Condra says. RedAlpha’s tactics are so simple and straightforward that Condra describes its work as espionage likely conducted on “a tight budget”—but in this case at least, simple can be pretty effective. “This is probably not the most well-resourced group,” he says. “They may want to cut corners and save some money when they register domains or acquire hosting. If there are campaigns they do with tactics that seem to work regardless of public exposure, there is no reason for them to change. It works and it’s cost effective.”  More specifically, RedAlpha has created and weaponized hundreds of fake, malicious domains disguised as their targets in an effort to steal usernames and passwords. “I’m willing to bet this is a pretty effective tactic for them,” Condra says. Researchers say this is likely due to poor adoption of basic security safeguards by organizations in their crosshairs, which creates a low bar to entry for the hackers.  “There are a lot of organizations that have not implemented multifactor authentication,” Condra adds. “That’s even more true on the government side in countries that move slower, have tighter budgets, and have more institutional resistance to change. We wouldn’t see RedAlpha doing this over the course of three years if they weren’t getting something out of it from their targets.” (Multifactor authentication is a cybersecurity technology that prevents hackers from taking over an account even if they have stolen a password; it is widely recommended and relatively easy to implement, but is often pushed aside for other priorities.)  As tensions continue to increase between the United States and China over Taiwan, analysts say, the hackers were likely conducting espionage with the goal of producing political intelligence. The group also impersonated government agencies from India, Brazil, Vietnam, and Portugal. China is widely considered to be one of the world’s most active and highly capable cyber powers, alongside the United States. While it has hackers in its intelligence and military agencies, China has also reportedly used private contractors like RedAlpha to conduct cyber-espionage operations, according to multiple American indictments.  Significant clues point to RedAlpha’s connections to important state groups. Shared details on registration of malicious domains connect the group to an individual who once said he was a member of the Green Army, China’s first underground hacking group, dating back to 1997. The Green Army, in fact, is one of the most important groups in the history of Chinese hacking; an alliance of several thousand Chinese nationalist hackers who targeted foreign websites, the organization gave rise to some of the country’s most prominent hackers, and parts of the faction evolved into major private sector cybersecurity firms still active today. What’s more, an email address used to register several of RedAlpha’s malicious domains across multiple espionage campaigns has been connected to a Chinese company that works with numerous government-owned companies, as well as the People’s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, an elite state-run institution focused on researching high-tech Chinese military capabilities. Now known as Jiangsu Cimer Information Security Technology Co., the company provides defensive and offensive cybersecurity products. Jiangsu Cimer did not respond to a request for comment.  “This strategy allows [the Chinese government] to outsource some of the lower-hanging fruit, the simple stuff that still needs to get done,” Condra says. “But this doesn’t necessarily need to be done by the most professional operators in China. They don’t need to burn the most valuable, advanced tools on low-level campaigns.” When reached for comment, a Chinese government spokesperson said the country opposes cyber attacks and “will never encourage, support, or connive at” them. ","A hacking group linked to China has spent the last three years targeting human rights organizations, think tanks, news media, and agencies of multiple foreign governments, according to a revealing new report from the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future. The report, shared exclusively with MIT Technology Review, offers new clues about how private contractors and front companies operating with relatively few resources can run long-standing hacking operations and succeed against high-value targets with crude but effective tactics. By using private-sector hackers, experts say, the Chinese government gains the ability to hit more espionage targets—and frees up resources within intelligence and military agencies to carry out more advanced hacking. The operation also hints at a widespread and persistent failure among vulnerable institutions to implement even basic cybersecurity defenses. A decade-long quest to become a cyber superpower is paying off for China. The hackers, known as RedAlpha, have taken aim at organizations including Amnesty International, the International Federation for Human Rights, Radio Free Asia, the Mercator Institute for China Studies, and other think tanks and government and humanitarian groups around the world. The hackers’ impact remains unclear, but judging from the sheer length of the campaign, analysts expect that the digital espionage has, broadly speaking, seen success. Recorded Future researchers have “high” confidence that RedAlpha is sponsored by the Chinese government as all of the targets “fall within [its] strategic interests,” says Jon Condra, director of the organization’s strategic threats team. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the hacking group has over the past few years been particularly interested in organizations in Taiwan, including the Democratic Progressive Party and the American Institute in Taiwan, which is the de facto United States embassy in the small island democracy. The government in Beijing claims Taiwan as part of Chinese territory. RedAlpha has been active since at least 2015, though it wasn’t publicly identified until 2018, in a report by Citizen Lab. It has consistently targeted groups that the Chinese Communist Party calls the “five poisons”: Tibetans, Uyghurs, Taiwanese, democracy activists, and the Falun Gong. All of these include domestic dissidents who, for various reasons, criticize and challenge the Communist Party’s grip on China. They also share international visibility and support. Citizen Lab’s work first uncovered RedAlpha’s campaign against the Tibetan community, government agencies, and a media group. In the years since, Recorded Future has identified additional cyber campaigns against Tibetans, and last year a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers indicated that the group is expanding its focus to include individuals, vulnerable ethnic groups, civil society organizations, and a rising number of government agencies. What’s particularly interesting about these new findings is that RedAlpha is still operating with the same simple and inexpensive playbook that it used years ago. In fact, this latest slate of espionage was linked to previous campaigns because the group reused many of the same domains, IP addresses, tactics, malware, and even domain registration information that has been publicly identified by cybersecurity experts for years. The Justice Department’s effort to prosecute cases of economic espionage had drifted from its stated mission and drawn fierce criticism for appearing to target researchers because of their ethnicity. “If it’s not broken, don’t change it,” Condra says. RedAlpha’s tactics are so simple and straightforward that Condra describes its work as espionage likely conducted on “a tight budget”—but in this case at least, simple can be pretty effective. “This is probably not the most well-resourced group,” he says. “They may want to cut corners and save some money when they register domains or acquire hosting. If there are campaigns they do with tactics that seem to work regardless of public exposure, there is no reason for them to change. It works and it’s cost effective.” More specifically, RedAlpha has created and weaponized hundreds of fake, malicious domains disguised as their targets in an effort to steal usernames and passwords. “I’m willing to bet this is a pretty effective tactic for them,” Condra says. Researchers say this is likely due to poor adoption of basic security safeguards by organizations in their crosshairs, which creates a low bar to entry for the hackers. “There are a lot of organizations that have not implemented multifactor authentication,” Condra adds. “That’s even more true on the government side in countries that move slower, have tighter budgets, and have more institutional resistance to change. We wouldn’t see RedAlpha doing this over the course of three years if they weren’t getting something out of it from their targets.” (Multifactor authentication is a cybersecurity technology that prevents hackers from taking over an account even if they have stolen a password; it is widely recommended and relatively easy to implement, but is often pushed aside for other priorities.) As tensions continue to increase between the United States and China over Taiwan, analysts say, the hackers were likely conducting espionage with the goal of producing political intelligence. The group also impersonated government agencies from India, Brazil, Vietnam, and Portugal. China is widely considered to be one of the world’s most active and highly capable cyber powers, alongside the United States. While it has hackers in its intelligence and military agencies, China has also reportedly used private contractors like RedAlpha to conduct cyber-espionage operations, according to multiple American indictments.

These external threats often feel more urgent and more dangerous, carrying greater potential consequences for the business. There’s no question about intent—it’s malicious. From a psychological perspective, it’s straightforward for security teams to identify the enemy and prepare for a fight. But what happens when the threat is internal? What if it’s coming from a teammate, a colleague you eat lunch with, or even the executive you report to? Security teams can’t take the same approach as with external actors, mainly because insiders aren’t faceless enemies to take down, even if their impact can be just as damaging. Insider risk occurs when sensitive corporate data—intellectual property, digital assets, trade secrets, crown jewels—move to untrusted places like personal devices, email, or cloud destinations. Such data movement presents considerable competitive, financial, privacy, and compliance risk. The scope of the problem is significant. According to Aberdeen Research, one in three reported data breaches involve an insider. The cost of a data breach from an insider can account for up to 20% of a company’s annual revenue. Insider risk is not a new problem, but it has become increasingly urgent due to drivers like digital transformation, hybrid-remote work, and the “great resignation,” not to mention a noticeable uptick in the use of contractors and recent layoffs. Insider risk can occur anywhere within a company, by anyone. It can come from former disgruntled employees stealing artificial intelligence trade secrets or someone poached by a competitor taking mobile chip design secrets on their way out the door. It can even come from the C-suite, as one company learned recently when its CFO accidentally shared a document to the entire company titled “Restructuring.” Unintentional data exposure can cause employee unrest, or even trigger US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD) filing requirements for public companies, if the leaked data could affect shareholders. For the security team, it may be inappropriate to take a combative approach—intended for outside threats—with a CFO over an unintentional data share. There is a better way. The way we should approach an external risk—like malware, for example—versus that from insiders is vastly different. There are many factors to consider when managing insider risk, especially as they relate to the desired business outcome. Insider investigations should not fall solely within the purview of the security team and often require the collaboration of security, HR, and legal. According to Gartner, “Survey data…indicates that over 50% of insider incidents are non-malicious,” which means that, more often than not, the employee at the root of the incident was simply trying to get their work done, making a mistake, or taking a shortcut. Treating them as though their actions were intentionally malicious is the wrong approach and could backfire. Those involved in the investigation must take an empathetic approach devoid of judgment. Otherwise, the risk of that employee making the same mistake again or becoming disgruntled and disenfranchised rises significantly.  Approaching insider investigations with empathy requires a psychological shift. It is the first step to building trust, so the best outcome for the organization can be reached. Here are five important elements of an empathetic approach to insider investigations: Approaching insider investigations with empathy helps build a culture of trust, open communication, and respect.

Corruption is sending shock waves through China’s chipmaking industry,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/05/1056975/corruption-chinas-chipmaking-industry/,2022-08-05,"<p>The arrests of several top semiconductor fund executives could force the government to rethink how it invests in the sector.</p>
","China’s chipmaking industry descended into chaos last week, with at least four top executives associated with a state-owned semiconductor fund arrested on corruption charges. It’s an explosive turn of events that could force the country to fundamentally rethink how it invests in chip development, according to analysts and experts.  On July 30, China’s top anticorruption institution announced that Ding Wenwu, the chief executive of the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, nicknamed the “Big Fund,” had been arrested for “suspected serious violations of the law.” Ding is not the only person in trouble. Two weeks ago, Lu Jun, a former executive at the Big Fund’s management institution, was also taken into custody, along with two other fund managers, according to the Chinese news outlet Caixin. Established in 2014, the Big Fund was intended to use government money to build a supply chain of chips made in China, thus reducing reliance on the US and its allies. The fund epitomizes the way the Chinese government can throw its weight behind a strategic industry—in this case, semiconductors.  Eight years later, a total of $30 billion poured into the industry—with $20 billion more on the way—has yielded a complicated mix of successes and failures. The fact that the fund was driven by a political mission and not financial interests made it ripe for corruption, and analysts say the latest investigations may push China to manage semiconductor funding with more precision and professional knowledge. The idea of the Big Fund was to pour money into industries not getting funding from traditional routes like venture capital. Instead of startups, its first $20 billion funding round, in 2014, went after publicly listed companies and their subsidiaries, often in semiconductor materials and manufacturing, according to Rui Ma, a tech analyst and host of the podcast Tech Buzz China. These companies find it harder to make money because any progress in chipmaking requires a long period of time and significant investment in research. Therefore they’re less attractive to venture capitalists, Ma says.  The Big Fund was arguably ahead of its time. In 2014, China’s central government decided it could use public funding to address the capacity gap in chip production while several local governments started experimenting with smaller funds. But it wasn’t until 2019, when the US cut off Huawei from accessing chips made with US technologies, that the situation became urgent. The semiconductor industry traditionally relies on global supplies, and Chinese tech companies are dependent on overseas suppliers like Taiwan’s TSMC, Korea’s Samsung, or the Netherlands’ ASML. All those countries are US allies.  The urgency has only intensified in recent months and years: the US is increasingly squeezing China’s ability to access advanced chip technologies, even asking ASML to stop exporting older lithography machines to China. That makes the Big Fund, and the associated self-sufficiency drive, ever more important.  The Chinese government has yet to reveal the exact reason why Ding and other people are being investigated. But most media outlets and analysts have associated the case with a cluster of corruption investigations around Tsinghua Unigroup, a semiconductor company invested in by the Big Fund that failed spectacularly in recent years. Founded in 1988, Tsinghua Unigroup is one of the oldest chipmakers in China. It made headlines in 2015 when its plan to acquire the American company Micron Technologies was blocked by the US government. Many of its ambitious acquisitions were backed by the Big Fund, which invested at least $2 billion in Unigroup and its subsidiaries to develop wafer manufacturing, flash memory chips, and 5G chips. But the juggernaut eventually faced bankruptcy in 2021. In July 2022, three former or current executives of Unigroup, including its chairman of 13 years, were put under investigation over corruption allegations, although no public charges have been posted so far. It remains unclear whether the failure of Unigroup directly triggered the anticorruption earthquake within Big Fund. However, the strategy that the latter has taken—throwing massive investments against the wall and seeing what sticks—can fail miserably. According to longtime observers, that strategy is also the perfect breeding ground for corruption. “This is the least surprising corruption investigation I’ve heard of for a while,” says Matt Sheehan, a fellow at the US think tank the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Not because I know Ding Wenwu is personally corrupt, but when you have that amount of money sloshing around in an industry, it’d be way more surprising if there isn’t a major corruption scandal.” A significant part of the problem was a lack of precision, says Sheehan. China knew it needed to invest in semiconductors but didn’t know what exact sub-industry or company to prioritize. The country has been forced to learn by trial and error, feeling its way through issues like the bankruptcy of Unigroup and the expanding technology blockade by the US. The next step should be more targeted investments into specific companies, Sheehan says. That might mean a new boss for the Big Fund—someone who’s better versed in getting financial returns, says Paul Triolo, a senior VP at the business strategy firm Albright Stonebridge, which advises companies operating in China. Many of the Big Fund’s managers came from government backgrounds and may simply have lacked the relevant experience. Ding, who’s under investigation now, used to be a department director at China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. “You need competent people to run this [Big Fund] that understand the industry, finance, and are not going to fund projects that don’t have a sound commercial basis,” Triolo says. Ultimately, these investigations may end up being positive for China’s semiconductor industry because they highlight the limitation of politically driven funding and may push the Big Fund to be managed on a more market-based basis. Beijing’s appetite for experiments is waning as its worries about self-sufficiency intensify. “They can’t afford to squander $5 billion on fabs that aren’t going to be viable,” says Triolo.

On July 30, China’s top anticorruption institution announced that Ding Wenwu, the chief executive of the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, nicknamed the “Big Fund,” had been arrested for “suspected serious violations of the law.” Ding is not the only person in trouble. Two weeks ago, Lu Jun, a former executive at the Big Fund’s management institution, was also taken into custody, along with two other fund managers, according to the Chinese news outlet Caixin. Established in 2014, the Big Fund was intended to use government money to build a supply chain of chips made in China, thus reducing reliance on the US and its allies. The fund epitomizes the way the Chinese government can throw its weight behind a strategic industry—in this case, semiconductors. Eight years later, a total of $30 billion poured into the industry—with $20 billion more on the way—has yielded a complicated mix of successes and failures. The fact that the fund was driven by a political mission and not financial interests made it ripe for corruption, and analysts say the latest investigations may push China to manage semiconductor funding with more precision and professional knowledge. The idea of the Big Fund was to pour money into industries not getting funding from traditional routes like venture capital. Instead of startups, its first $20 billion funding round, in 2014, went after publicly listed companies and their subsidiaries, often in semiconductor materials and manufacturing, according to Rui Ma, a tech analyst and host of the podcast Tech Buzz China. These companies find it harder to make money because any progress in chipmaking requires a long period of time and significant investment in research. Therefore they’re less attractive to venture capitalists, Ma says. The Big Fund was arguably ahead of its time. In 2014, China’s central government decided it could use public funding to address the capacity gap in chip production while several local governments started experimenting with smaller funds. But it wasn’t until 2019, when the US cut off Huawei from accessing chips made with US technologies, that the situation became urgent. The semiconductor industry traditionally relies on global supplies, and Chinese tech companies are dependent on overseas suppliers like Taiwan’s TSMC, Korea’s Samsung, or the Netherlands’ ASML. All those countries are US allies. The urgency has only intensified in recent months and years: the US is increasingly squeezing China’s ability to access advanced chip technologies, even asking ASML to stop exporting older lithography machines to China. That makes the Big Fund, and the associated self-sufficiency drive, ever more important. The Chinese government has yet to reveal the exact reason why Ding and other people are being investigated. But most media outlets and analysts have associated the case with a cluster of corruption investigations around Tsinghua Unigroup, a semiconductor company invested in by the Big Fund that failed spectacularly in recent years. Founded in 1988, Tsinghua Unigroup is one of the oldest chipmakers in China. It made headlines in 2015 when its plan to acquire the American company Micron Technologies was blocked by the US government. Many of its ambitious acquisitions were backed by the Big Fund, which invested at least $2 billion in Unigroup and its subsidiaries to develop wafer manufacturing, flash memory chips, and 5G chips. But the juggernaut eventually faced bankruptcy in 2021. In July 2022, three former or current executives of Unigroup, including its chairman of 13 years, were put under investigation over corruption allegations, although no public charges have been posted so far. It remains unclear whether the failure of Unigroup directly triggered the anticorruption earthquake within Big Fund. However, the strategy that the latter has taken—throwing massive investments against the wall and seeing what sticks—can fail miserably. According to longtime observers, that strategy is also the perfect breeding ground for corruption. “This is the least surprising corruption investigation I’ve heard of for a while,” says Matt Sheehan, a fellow at the US think tank the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Not because I know Ding Wenwu is personally corrupt, but when you have that amount of money sloshing around in an industry, it’d be way more surprising if there isn’t a major corruption scandal.” A significant part of the problem was a lack of precision, says Sheehan. China knew it needed to invest in semiconductors but didn’t know what exact sub-industry or company to prioritize. The country has been forced to learn by trial and error, feeling its way through issues like the bankruptcy of Unigroup and the expanding technology blockade by the US. The next step should be more targeted investments into specific companies, Sheehan says. That might mean a new boss for the Big Fund—someone who’s better versed in getting financial returns, says Paul Triolo, a senior VP at the business strategy firm Albright Stonebridge, which advises companies operating in China. Many of the Big Fund’s managers came from government backgrounds and may simply have lacked the relevant experience. Ding, who’s under investigation now, used to be a department director at China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. “You need competent people to run this [Big Fund] that understand the industry, finance, and are not going to fund projects that don’t have a sound commercial basis,” Triolo says. Ultimately, these investigations may end up being positive for China’s semiconductor industry because they highlight the limitation of politically driven funding and may push the Big Fund to be managed on a more market-based basis. Beijing’s appetite for experiments is waning as its worries about self-sufficiency intensify. “They can’t afford to squander $5 billion on fabs that aren’t going to be viable,” says Triolo.","['chipmake', 'industry', 'descend', 'chaos', 'last', 'week', 'least', 'top', 'executive', 'associate', 'stateowned', 'semiconductor', 'fund', 'arrest', 'corruption', 'charge', '’',

How governments seize millions in stolen cryptocurrency,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/07/26/1056447/how-governments-seize-millions-in-cryptocurrency/,2022-07-26,"<p>Cryptocurrency hacks are increasing. Here’s how the government tries to track, freeze, and seize the stolen money before it disappears out of reach.</p>
","Tech Review Explains: where our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you better understand the world we live in—and what comes next. There have been so many recent multimillion-dollar cryptocurrency thefts that it’s easy to lose track. Organized crime, bad cybersecurity, financially motivated spies, and colorful criminals of all kinds have made so many headlines that even huge heists can go mostly unnoticed by the public.  A suspected North Korean heist of cryptocurrency only adds to an already long and growing list of big crypto hacks. But sometimes the government is able to get it back. Last week, the United States seized $500,000 in cryptocurrency from alleged North Korean hackers who got that money by extorting American medical organizations. That’s just a drop in the bucket considering the grand total: the IRS alone seized $3.5 billion in cryptocurrency in 2021.  But how exactly does seizing cryptocurrency work? Skilled criminals know they need to make dirty money clean. Money laundering is the age-old act of making the capital gained from illegal activity look as if it has no connection to the crime itself, so that the money can then be used freely. “I’d say the laundering is more sophisticated than the hacks themselves,” Christopher Janczewski, who was a lead case agent at the IRS specializing in cryptocurrency cases, told MIT Technology Review previously.  More than $8.6 billion was successfully laundered through cryptocurrency in 2021.  Unique among nations, North Korea has used theft of cryptocurrency as a means to fund its financially isolated regime. Pyongyang uses cryptocurrency to get around the restrictions imposed upon it and pay for anything from weapons to luxuries. The tactics are always evolving. A “peel chain” moves cryptocurrency through thousands of transactions to obfuscate the source and destination. “Chain hopping” crosses blockchains and currencies. “Cryptocurrency mixers” take transactions from anyone and then pay out in different wallets or even different currencies in an effort to disconnect the deposits and withdrawals. All of this is meant to throw off investigators. The US government has invested significantly in blockchain surveillance and analysis tools. Between rising electricity rates and soaring climate costs, cryptomining is taking its toll on communities. Companies like Chainalysis, TRM Labs, and Elliptic sell software to track and analyze the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Governments have heavily bought into this nascent industry as a way to unmask hackers stealing, laundering, and cashing out of illicit cryptocurrency. For example, TRM Forensics is a product designed to trace cryptocurrency transactions across 26 different blockchains, graph the flow of funds, and identify the wallets where the coins ended up. Similarly, Chainalysis Reactor provides ongoing surveillance of different cryptocurrency assets so a customer, like a US government agency, can know if a specific wallet belongs to a darknet market, a high-risk cryptocurrency exchange, or an online casino. The output will include neat sets of data visualizations ready for government investigations and, eventually, court prosecutions. But no amount of tracing by software will actually get the money back.  “Tracing is just one tool in the toolbox,” says Ari Redbord, a former federal prosecutor and currently the head of government affairs at TRM Labs. “Then they have to use police work for the end of the rainbow. Some of it is just great investigative work.” There are three basic ways the US government can lawfully access and seize funds.  The largest single seizure in US history came just this year, when the Justice Department took hold of $3.6 billion in cryptocurrency allegedly stolen during the 2016 hack of Bitfinex, a virtual currency exchange. This case was, in key ways, much simpler for American police because two arrests of US residents were made in Manhattan. Blockchain analysis found that the stolen currency was moved, after a long but unsuccessful attempt to launder the cash, to accounts controlled by a suspect. Police got a search warrant for the suspect’s cloud storage account, which contained an encrypted file. The file was decrypted and found to contain 2,000 cryptocurrency addresses and private keys. Almost every wallet was linked directly to the Bitfinex hack. Law enforcement received a seizure warrant and took the money into the government’s possession—and arrested two suspects. The cryptocurrency ecosystem has a reputation in the popular imagination as a Wild West. But the truth is that, in a bid to do business and make money in wealthy nations, exchanges and other cryptocurrency businesses have become vastly more compliant with Western law enforcement over the years.  After meeting probable-cause and burden-of-proof requirements, law enforcement can get seizure warrants for any illicit funds that eventually land on compliant exchanges—and many funds eventually do. Law enforcement will then work with the crypto business to move the funds to a government-controlled wallet or freeze them. “Another method is that the adversary or a member of their conspiracy cooperates and provides private keys to the government as part of a plea negotiation or cooperation to benefit them in some way,” says Gurvais Grigg, who was assistant director of the FBI before becoming an executive at Chainalysis. The third possibility is to compromise the target’s security—which can happen in numerous ways.  “When you're talking about a country like North Korea or Russian cyber criminal organizations, it can take years of building out networks of confidential informants and working with other governments, even those that aren't always friendly to us,” Redbord says. “One piece is potentially hacking into a server or machine or, frankly more likely, just great police work.” For hackers outside the United States, the task is trickier. An arrest can be impossible if the suspect is in a country that doesn’t cooperate with Washington, so prosecutors focus elsewhere. “Good prosecutors understand that a criminal prosecution is only one part of the larger investigation and results in these types of cases,” says Redbord, who was a prosecutor for 11 years. Instead, the focus is the money. The other aspects are regulation, politics, and diplomacy. There are several notable “rogue areas” around the world that don’t comply with international anti-money-laundering rules, Grigg says, including North Korea and Iran, “but those parts of the world are becoming smaller and smaller islands.” There are two reasons for that. If you’re a business, compliance means you have a chance to access the world’s richest markets; if you’re a nation, it means your own lawful orders can be honored in return. As governments become better at surveilling and seizing cryptocurrency, hackers and criminal tactics continue to evolve. Mixers offer a popular tactic these days. Mixers take in funds from various origins, pool them together, and then send funds back out at random as a way to obfuscate their source and ultimate destination. Although there are numerous reasons one could use mixers, their chief customers have always been criminals and hackers.  According to a recent report from Chainalysis, mixers have moved over $50 million monthly on average this year, twice as much as last year. Blockchain analysis firms are hustling to tackle the problem and reliably “demix” the funds, but for now, mixers remain a go-to tool for criminals. The US Treasury Department has opted for another, more immediate approach: in May 2022, the US issued the first sanctions against a cryptocurrency mixer. This one was allegedly used to launder cryptocurrency following a $600 million theft by North Korean hackers. “The last thing we’ve seen is the increase in the multiplicity of attacks,” Griggs says. “Think of thousands of wildebeests crossing a river at once so that crocodiles can only get a few. Attackers have flooded the zone with an increased number of attacks, potentially in the hopes of making it difficult for authorities to catch an individual actor.  “The problem is that investigators can link what appear to be disparate attacks back to a central command, and in some cases this might make it easier for the government to prove a large conspiracy.”The efforts to track, freeze, and seize the funds will only become more important. And it’s just as certain that billions will continue to slip through the cracks. Just before news of the US seizure against North Korean hackers made headlines, another group from North Korea launched an international ransomware hacking campaign.
