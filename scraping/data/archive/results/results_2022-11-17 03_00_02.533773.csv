This is a sponsored article brought to you by UL Solutions . Invest in building your team ’ s excellence with functional safety training and certification services from UL Solutions , a global safety science leader . Our UL Certified Functional Safety Certification programs provide your team opportunities to learn about — or deepen their existing knowledge and skills in — functional safety to achieve professional credentials in this space . We offer personnel certification at both the professional and expert levels in automotive , autonomous vehicles , electronics and semiconductors , machinery , industrial automation , and cybersecurity . You can now register for any of the offerings listed below . All our instructor-led , virtual courses provide a deep dive into key functional safety standards . UL Certified Functional Safety Professional in IEC 61511 Class with Exam - Virtual This three-day course provides a comprehensive overview of the IEC 61511:2016 and ANSI/ISA 61511:2018 standards for the process industry . Participants who complete all three days of training can take a two-hour certification exam on the morning of the fourth day . Those who pass the exam earn individual certification as a UL Certified Functional Safety Professional in IEC 61511 or UL-CFSP . Purchase training→ Functional Safety Overview and Designing Safety-Related Electronic Control Systems in Accordance with IEC 61508 Standard Class with Exam - Virtual ( English ) This three-day course helps engineers , developers and managers successfully apply IEC 61508 to their safety-related electrical systems . IEC 61508 serves as the base functional safety standard for various industries , including process , nuclear and machinery , among others . This course includes a one-hour follow-up Q & A session ( scheduled at a later date ) with one of UL Solutions ’ functional safety experts . Purchase training→ UL Certified Autonomy Safety Professional Training in UL 4600 2nd Edition Class with Exam - Virtual ( English ) This 2.5-day course highlights modern-day autonomous robotics , industrial automation , sensors and semi-automated technologies and how they can apply to safety . The course focuses on UL 4600 , the Standard for Evaluation of Autonomous Products , and includes information on related safety standards . Purchase training→ UL Certified Functional Safety Professional Training in Agriculture and Construction Machinery Class with Exam - Virtual ( English ) This 2.5-day course will cover functional safety standards and concepts related to agricultural and construction earth-moving machinery . Applicable standards covered in this training include the EU Machinery Directive ; ISO 19014:2018 , Earth-Moving Machinery — Functional Safety — Part 1 : Methodology to Determine Safety-Related Parts of the Control System and Performance Requirements ; and ISO 25119:2018 , Tractors and Machinery for Agriculture and Forestry — Safety-Related Parts of Control Systems . UL Solutions ’ experts will cover topics such as hazard identification and risk assessment per ISO 12100:2010 , Safety of Machinery — General Principles for Design — Risk Assessment and Risk Reduction . Case studies on a range of topics , including motor drives and safety product life cycles , will also help provide examples of how the requirements and concepts of the standards apply . Purchase training→ UL Certified Functional Safety Professional Training in Machinery Class with Exam - Virtual ( English ) This 2.5-day course is for engineers working on programmable machinery and control systems . The training course will cover functional safety standards and concepts related to the EU Machinery Directive , including ISO 13849 , Safety of Machinery - Safety-Related Parts of Control Systems ; IEC 61800-5-2 , Adjustable Speed Electrical Power Drive Systems - Part 5-2 : Safety Requirements - Functional ; and IEC 62061 , Safety of Machinery - Functional Safety of Safety-Related Electrical , Electronic and Programmable Electronic Control Systems . Purchase training→ The prosthetics industry is too focused on high-tech limbs that are complicated , costly , and often impractical The author , Britt Young , holding her Ottobock bebionic bionic arm . In Jules Verne ’ s 1865 novel From the Earth to the Moon , members of the fictitious Baltimore Gun Club , all disabled Civil War veterans , restlessly search for a new enemy to conquer . They had spent the war innovating new , deadlier weaponry . By the war ’ s end , with “ not quite one arm between four persons , and exactly two legs between six , ” these self-taught amputee-weaponsmiths decide to repurpose their skills toward a new projectile : a rocket ship . The story of the Baltimore Gun Club propelling themselves to the moon is about the extraordinary masculine power of the veteran , who doesn ’ t simply “ overcome ” his disability ; he derives power and ambition from it . Their “ crutches , wooden legs , artificial arms , steel hooks , caoutchouc [ rubber ] jaws , silver craniums [ and ] platinum noses ” don ’ t play leading roles in their personalities—they are merely tools on their bodies . These piecemeal men are unlikely crusaders of invention with an even more unlikely mission . And yet who better to design the next great leap in technology than men remade by technology themselves ?",0.0
