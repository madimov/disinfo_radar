        Celebrating the Art of Code
    ",https://spectrum.ieee.org/art-of-code,2022-11-15 20:00:17.479036,,"The Computer History Museum ’ s yearlong exhibition looks at the software that makes the world This is an early MacPaint drawing by the artist Susan Kare . The Computer History Museum released the source code for MacPaint and QuickDraw in 2010 . We use software as an engine to power and move our digital world . We create software from code—that is , special languages that we can read and write , and that determine what computers and digital technologies actually do . Writing code is an art , a creative human activity undertaken by both individuals and by teams , and using sophisticated tools . The code that people create can be art in another sense also : For those who are familiar with these special languages , they can see beauty within it , much as we all can appreciate the design of a stunning garden or public park . The Computer History Museum invites you to accompany us for a yearlong tour through our “ Art of Code ” exhibition , which will provide many opportunities to explore remarkable stories , events , and historical source code releases . We will hear from experts and luminaries about how software is created and the important consequences it has for society . We will explore firsthand the source code behind major developments in computing . And we will engage in discussions about critical issues today and their relationship to code . A cassette containing the Apple II ’ s DOS source code , which CHM released in 2013.Computer History Museum In September , we kicked off the Art of Code by marking the 50th anniversary of the breakthrough software language and environment Smalltalk . Smalltalk embraced a fresh , modular , and dynamic approach to the art of code called object-oriented programming . It was also a major step in the use of computers by children . The reverberations of each are still felt today . You can watch the full program of our Smalltalk event here and read a blog recap here . Children animating horses in Smalltalk-72 on an Alto computer . In 2020 , CHM began hosting the Smalltalk Zoo , a collection of historical versions of Smalltalk from 1972 to 1995 in an in-browser emulation.PARC Library In October , we celebrated this year ’ s new CHM Fellows , who all have made remarkable contributions to the art of code , including Smalltalk , the pathbreaking Plato system of online communities , learning , and collaboration , and the development of the Internet itself . Watch the full program here and read a blog recap here . We will announce other events for the Art of Code throughout the coming year . Ken Thompson [ seated ] and Dennis Ritchie work with a DEC PDP-11 , to which they migrated the UNIX software in 1971 . In 2019 , CHM released the source code for the earliest version of UNIX.Computer History Museum For programmers , developers , coders , and other students of code , Art of Code will have a remarkable series of historical source code releases over the coming year . We will begin with the public release of the source code for PostScript , the innovative software behind printing as we know it , the rise of Adobe , and PDF . Closely following will be CHM ’ s public release of the source code for the Apple Lisa computer , a remarkably influential project by Apple that did so much to bring the graphical user interface and “ What You See is What You Get ” approaches into personal computing . This set of floppy disks contains Microsoft 's MS-DOS 2.0 . In 2010 , CHM released the source code for MS-DOS 1.1 and 2.0.Computer History Museum Later in the year , look for events and offerings marking the 50th anniversaries of some of the pathbreaking developments in networked personal computing at Xerox PARC : the revolutionary Xerox Alto system and the era-defining network technology of Ethernet . CHM will also be releasing a digital archive of PARC ’ s extraordinary historical contributions , including source code , documents , images , and more . Please join the Computer History Museum for this Art of Code journey by signing up here for news and updates , and begin your own journey through our Art of Code resources by watching this movie , exploring this playlist of CHM ’ s historical source code releases , and visiting Make Software , Change the World ! in person and online . Editor 's note : This post originally appeared on the blog of the Computer History Museum . David C. Brock is an historian of technology , director of curatorial affairs at the Computer History Museum , and director of CHM ’ s Software History Center . He focuses on histories of computing and semiconductors as well as on oral history . He is the coauthor of Moore ’ s Law : The Life of Gordon Moore , Silicon Valley ’ s Quiet Revolutionary and is on Twitter @ dcbrock @ federate.social . Hoff thought designing 12 custom chips for a calculator was crazy , so he created the Intel 4004 The rays of the rising sun have barely reached the foothills of Silicon Valley , but Marcian E. ( Ted ) Hoff Jr. is already up to his elbows in electronic parts , digging through stacks of dusty circuit boards . This is the monthly flea market at Foothill College , and he rarely misses it . Ted Hoff is part of electronics industry legend . While a research manager at Intel Corp. , then based in Mountain View , he realized that silicon technology had advanced to the point that , with careful engineering , a complete central processor could fit on a chip . Teaming up with Stanley Mazor and Federico Faggin , he created the first commercial microprocessor , the Intel 4004 .",0.0
