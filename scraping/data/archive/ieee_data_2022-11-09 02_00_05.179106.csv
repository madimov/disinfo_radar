	No one sets out to put together half a puzzle. Similarly, researchers and engineers in the defense industry want to see the whole picture – seeing their innovations make it into the hands of warfighters and commercial customers. 
 
	That desire is fueling growth at BAE Systems’ FAST Labs research and development (R&D) organization.
 
	BAE Systems formed its FAST Labs R&D organization with the goal of cultivating innovation and creating disruptive technology. It is unique in the defense industry because it is an in-house, customer-focused R&D organization collaborating internally across the BAE Systems enterprise to develop and evolve technologies in advanced electronics, autonomy, cyber, electromagnetic warfare, sensors and processing, and more.

	Today, the FAST Labs R&D organization is a place where research teams can invent and see their work come to life. While there are many examples we cannot publicly report, word has gotten out to the research and engineering community – especially those who have grown frustrated with the traditional defense R&D process or have been working on compartmentalized projects in the industry.
 
	At FAST Labs, engineers get to turn their breakthrough technology innovations into real-life impact.
