"The China AI and Autonomy Report: Issue 18, June 30, 2022 - Intro (no tag)",https://www.cna.org/our-media/newsletters/china-ai-and-autonomy-report/issue-18,2022-06-30 00:00:00,"Intro (no tag) Welcome to the China AI and Autonomy Report, a biweekly newsletter published by CNA.
In this issue, a PLA Daily article discusses using unmanned systems and AI to aid surprise attacks in deep-sea warfare. The PRC’s first 100+ ton unmanned surface vessel has conducted its first autonomous sea trial. PRC researchers have reportedly developed an AI model for use in space warfare, while engineers at the Aviation Industry Corporation of China have developed an unmanned cargo plane that adheres to Chinese Civil Aviation Regulations. The South China Morning Post reports that the PRC has developed an exascale supercomputing capability nearly on par with that of the US. The PRC has fully approved the “East Data, West Computing” plan, which has established 10 computing centers, although obstacles to its success remain.
