We begin this issue with coverage of the PRC exercises around Taiwan that followed Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's trip there on August 2-3. According to Taiwan media, PRC UAVs overflew Jinmen and other islands belonging to Taiwan, leading the Taiwan military to fire flares as warning shots. We also discuss three indicators that PRC commercial unmanned systems are being used for military purposes: (1) The Russian embassy in Beijing deleted a Weibo post praising the military utility of drones manufactured by the PRC company DJI. (2) A “robot dog” carrying an anti-tank weapon demonstrated at a Russian arms exhibition appeared to be of PRC origin. (3) The US-based website The War Zone reported extensively on strikes against the Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters and a Russian oil refinery that were conducted using UAVs similar in appearance to a PRC commercial drone. In non-military news, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has published a list of 30 recommendation algorithms, along with short descriptions of their use. The normally tightly held algorithms were submitted to CAC by many of China's top tech companies in accordance with a regulation that came into effect on March 1. Meanwhile, the Beijing city government has announced a plan to develop the market for virtual humans—digital avatars often used in advertising and entertainment.

We begin with PRC media discussion of the Russia-Ukraine war and counter UAV operations. The Hong Kong-based Phoenix News reports that the Russian military has been successful in downing Ukrainian UAVs with the use of an integrated air defense system combining long-, medium-, and short-range missiles and artillery. An article in the PLA Daily, however, discusses some of the difficulties in countering UAVs and concludes that challenges will remain for some time. As for future warfare, a PLA Daily article urges its readers to move beyond a mentality focused on mechanized warfare and to focus instead on intellingentized warfare. The PLA Daily also carried a lengthy article on the use of “digital twin” technologies to improve the PLA’s education, training, command and control, and research and development (R&D). Meanwhile, a student team from the PLA’s National University of Defense Technology took two first-place finishes in an international robotics competition held in Bangkok. Moving away from military news, Guangming Daily discusses how technology can be used to address grassroots social governance issues. In industry news, both Fortune and the Financial Times report that venture capital firm Sequoia China will invest a likely record-breaking US$9 billion in PRC tech startups, focusing on PRC government priorities such as AI.

We begin this issue with a discussion of two PRC media reports commenting on the successes and challenges that the Russian military has experienced in its UAV and counter-UAV operations in Ukraine. Some of the challenges discussed include the inability of Russian radar systems to detect Ukraine’s UAVs, large numbers of Ukraine’s UAVs overwhelming Russia’s air defense systems, and the Russian military’s inability to obtain a sufficient supply of UAVs for the war effort. We also cover several PLA Daily articles examining intelligent warfare, discussing such topics as countering unmanned systems, cognitive warfare in a “post-truth” era, the importance of high-quality data in command decision-making, and hybrid warfare involving the metaverse. Recognizing the critical role of information fusion technologies in collecting data from various types of sources in an intelligentized warfare environment, the Chinese Institute of Command and Control has established the Information Fusion Professional Committee. PLA researchers are trying to use AI-enabled cubesats (satellites weighing less than 2 kg) to defend their satellites, envisioning that AI could be used to determine exactly when and where to release the cubesats to fend off enemy satellites. A journal article reveals that China’s smart court SoS (system of systems) “now connects to the desk of every working judge across the country.” The smart court SoS trains on 100,000 cases from across the country every day, and judges must provide an explanation if they disagree with the system’s recommended case decisions. Meanwhile, the PRC government has fined ride-hailing company Didi $1.2 billion for violating its laws on data security and personal information protection.
