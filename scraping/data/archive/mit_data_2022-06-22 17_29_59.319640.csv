In Hollywood, for example, studios are using AI to surface and measure bias in scripts—the very tools producers and writers need to create more equitable and inclusive media. However, AI is only as smart as the data it's trained on, and that data reflects real-life biases. To avoid perpetuating stereotypes and exclusivity, technologists are addressing equity and inclusion both in real-life and in their innovations. As technologists look to use AI to find human-centric solutions to optimize industry practices and everyday lives alike, it’s critical to be mindful of the ways that our innate biases can have unintended consequences. “As humans, we are highly biased,” says Beena Ammanath, the global head of the Deloitte AI Institute, and tech and AI ethics lead at Deloitte. “And as these biases get baked into the systems, there is very high likelihood of sections of society being left behind—underrepresented minorities, people who don't have access to certain tools—and it can drive more inequity in the world.”       Projects that begin with good intentions -- to create equal outcomes or mitigate past inequities -- can still end up biased if systems are trained with biased data or researchers aren’t accounting for how their own perspectives affect lines of research. Thus far, adjusting for AI biases has often been reactive with the discovery of biased algorithms or underrepresented demographics emerging after the fact, says Ammanath. But, companies now have to learn how to be proactive, to mitigate these issues early on, and to take accountability for missteps in their AI endeavors.   In AI, bias appears in the form of algorithmic bias. “Algorithmic bias is a set of several challenges in constructing an AI model,” explains Kirk Bresniker, chief architect at Hewlett Packard Labs and vice president at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). “We can have a challenge because we have an algorithm that is not capable of handling diverse inputs, or because we haven't gathered broad enough sets of data to incorporate into the training of our model. In either case, we have insufficient data.” Algorithmic bias can also come from inaccurate processing, data being modified, or someone injecting a false signal. Whether intentional or not, the bias results in unfair outcomes, perhaps privileging one group or excluding another altogether. As an example, Ammanath describes an algorithm designed to recognize different types of shoes such as flip flops, sandals, formal shoes, and sneakers. However, when it was released, the algorithm couldn’t recognize women’s shoes with heels. The development team was a group of fresh college grads—all male—who never thought of training it on the heels of women’s shoes.  “This is a trivial example, but you realize that the data set was limited,” Ammanath said. “Now think of a similar algorithm using historical data to diagnose a disease or an illness. What if it wasn't trained on certain body types or certain genders or certain races? Those impacts are huge.       Critically, she says If you don't have that diversity at the table, you are going to miss certain scenarios.”     Simply obtaining more (and more diverse) datasets is a formidable challenge, especially as data has become more centralized. Data sharing brings up many concerns, not the least of which are security and privacy.       “Right now, we have a situation where individual users have far less power than the vast companies that are collecting and processing their data,” says Nathan Schneider assistant professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Boulder. It is likely that expanded laws and regulations will eventually dictate when and how data can be shared and used. But, innovation doesn’t wait for lawmakers. Right now, the onus is on AI-developing organizations to be good data stewards, protecting individual privacy while striving to reduce algorithmic bias. Because technology is maturing so quickly, it’s impossible to rely on regulations to cover every possible scenario, says Deloitte’s Ammanath. “We are going to enter an era where you're balancing between being adherent to existing regulations and at the same time, self-regulating.”  This kind of self-regulation means raising the bar for the entire supply chain of technologies that go into building AI solutions, from the data to the training to the infrastructure required to make those solutions possible. Further, companies need to create pathways for individuals across departments to raise concerns over biases. While it is unlikely that bias can be eliminated altogether, companies must regularly audit the efficacy of their AI solutions. Because of the highly contextual nature of AI, self-regulation will look different for each company. HPE, for example, established ethical AI guidelines. A diverse set of individuals from across the company spent nearly a year working together to establish the company’s principles for AI, and then vetted those principles with a broad set of employees to ensure they could be followed and that they made sense for the corporate culture. “We wanted to raise the general understanding of the issues and then collect best practices,"" says HPE’s Bresniker. “This is everyone’s job—to be literate in this area.”       Technologists have reached a maturity with AI that has progressed from research to practical applications and value creation across all industries. The growing pervasiveness of AI across society means that organizations now have an ethical responsibility to provide robust, inclusive, and accessible solutions. This responsibility has prompted organizations to examine, sometimes for the first time, the data they’re pulling into a process. “We want people to establish that providence, that measurable confidence in the data that's going in,” says Bresniker. “They have that ability to stop perpetuating systemic inequalities and create equitable outcomes for a better future.” This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

It outstripped the original DALL-E in almost every way. Now, just a few weeks later, Google Brain has revealed its own image-making AI, called Imagen. And it performs even better than DALL-E 2: it scores higher on a standard measure for rating the quality of computer-generated images, and the pictures it produced were preferred by a group of human judges. “We’re living through the AI space race!” one Twitter user commented. “The stock image industry is officially toast,” tweeted another.

Mixing concepts like “fuzzy panda” and “making dough” forces the neural network to learn how to manipulate those concepts in a way that makes sense. But the cuteness hides a darker side to these tools, one that the public doesn’t get to see because it would reveal the ugly truth about how they are created. Most of the images that OpenAI and Google make public are cherry-picked. We only see cute images that match their prompts with uncanny accuracy—that’s to be expected. But we also see no images that contain hateful stereotypes, racism, or misogyny. There is no violent, sexist imagery. There is no panda porn. And from what we know about how these tools are built—there should be. Not a single human face depicted in the hundreds of pictures in the paper, haha. I guess that's one way to eliminate concerns over representation bias. https://t.co/tKX8khoTDR It’s no secret that large models, such as DALL-E 2 and Imagen, trained on vast numbers of documents and images taken from the web, absorb the worst aspects of that data as well as the best. OpenAI and Google explicitly acknowledge this.    Scroll down the Imagen website—past the dragon fruit wearing a karate belt and the small cactus wearing a hat and sunglasses—to the section on societal impact and you get this: “While a subset of our training data was filtered to removed noise and undesirable content, such as pornographic imagery and toxic language, we also utilized [the] LAION-400M dataset which is known to contain a wide range of inappropriate content including pornographic imagery, racist slurs, and harmful social stereotypes. Imagen relies on text encoders trained on uncurated web-scale data, and thus inherits the social biases and limitations of large language models. As such, there is a risk that Imagen has encoded harmful stereotypes and representations, which guides our decision to not release Imagen for public use without further safeguards in place.” It's the same kind of acknowledgement that OpenAI made when it revealed GPT-3 in 2019: “internet-trained models have internet-scale biases.” And as Mike Cook, who researches AI creativity at Queen Mary University of London, has pointed out, it’s in the ethics statements that accompanied Google’s large language model PaLM and OpenAI’s DALL-E 2. In short, these firms know that their models are capable of producing awful content, and they have no idea how to fix that.  I feel like at some point in the last few years we somehow confused ""AI ethics"" with ""pointing at the mess you made and shrugging"".https://t.co/JEu2ngilEZ pic.twitter.com/mMbNQUzgXW For now, the solution is to keep them caged up. OpenAI is making DALL-E 2 available only to a handful of trusted users; Google has no plans to release Imagen. That’s fine if these were simply proprietary tools. But these firms are pushing the boundaries of what AI can do and their work shapes the kind of AI that all of us live with. They are creating new marvels, but also new horrors— and moving on with a shrug. When Google’s in-house ethics team raised problems with the large language models, in 2020 it sparked a fight that ended with two of its leading researchers being fired. Large language models and image-making AIs have the potential to be world-changing technologies, but only if their toxicity is tamed. This will require a lot more research. There are small steps to open these kinds of neural network up for widespread study. A few weeks ago Meta released a large language model to researchers, warts and all. And Hugging Face is set to release its open-source version of GPT-3 in the next couple of months.  For now, enjoy the teddies.

"The Download: DeepMind’s AI shortcomings, and China’s social media translation problem",https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/05/23/1052629/download-deepmind-ai-gato-china-social-media-translation-english-twitter/,2022-05-23,"<p>Plus: Ukraine's startup employees are getting back to work</p>
","This is today's edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what's going on in the world of technology. The hype around DeepMind's new AI model misses what's actually cool about it Earlier this month, DeepMind presented a new “generalist” AI model called Gato. The model can play the video game Atari, caption images, chat, and stack blocks with a real robot arm, the Alphabet-owned AI lab announced. All in all, Gato can do hundreds of different tasks.But while Gato is undeniably fascinating, in the week since its release some researchers have got a bit carried away.One of DeepMind’s top researchers and a coauthor of the Gato paper, Nando de Freitas, couldn’t contain his excitement. “The game is over!” he tweeted, suggesting that there is now a clear path from Gato to artificial general intelligence, or ‘AGI’, a vague concept of human or superhuman-level AI. The way to build AGI, he claimed, is mostly a question of scale: making models such as Gato bigger and better.Unsurprisingly, de Freitas’s announcement triggered breathless press coverage that Deepmind is “on the verge” of human-level artificial intelligence.

","This is today's edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what's going on in the world of technology. The hype around DeepMind's new AI model misses what's actually cool about it Earlier this month, DeepMind presented a new “generalist” AI model called Gato. The model can play the video game Atari, caption images, chat, and stack blocks with a real robot arm, the Alphabet-owned AI lab announced. All in all, Gato can do hundreds of different tasks.But while Gato is undeniably fascinating, in the week since its release some researchers have got a bit carried away.One of DeepMind’s top researchers and a coauthor of the Gato paper, Nando de Freitas, couldn’t contain his excitement. “The game is over!” he tweeted, suggesting that there is now a clear path from Gato to artificial general intelligence, or ‘AGI’, a vague concept of human or superhuman-level AI. The way to build AGI, he claimed, is mostly a question of scale: making models such as Gato bigger and better.Unsurprisingly, de Freitas’s announcement triggered breathless press coverage that Deepmind is “on the verge” of human-level artificial intelligence. This is not the first time hype has outstripped reality. Other exciting new AI models, such as OpenAI’s text generator GPT-3 and image generator DALL-E, have generated similar grand claims.For many in the field, this kind of feverish discourse overshadows other important research areas in AI.

The hype around DeepMind’s new AI model misses what’s actually cool about it,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/05/23/1052627/deepmind-gato-ai-model-hype/,2022-05-23,"<p>Some worry that the chatter about these tools is doing the whole field a disservice.</p>
","Earlier this month, DeepMind presented a new “generalist” AI model called Gato. The model can play Atari video games, caption images, chat, and stack blocks with a real robot arm, the Alphabet-owned AI lab announced. All in all, Gato can do 604 different tasks.  But while Gato is undeniably fascinating, in the week since its release some researchers have gotten a bit carried away. One of DeepMind’s top researchers and a coauthor of the Gato paper, Nando de Freitas, couldn’t contain his excitement. “The game is over!” he tweeted, suggesting that there is now a clear path from Gato to artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a vague concept of human- or superhuman-level AI. The way to build AGI, he claimed, is mostly a question of scale: making models such as Gato bigger and better.  Unsurprisingly, de Freitas’s announcement triggered breathless press coverage that DeepMind is “on the verge” of human-level artificial intelligence. This is not the first time hype has outstripped reality. Other exciting new AI models, such as OpenAI’s text generator GPT-3 and image generator DALL-E, have generated similarly grand claims. For many in the field, this kind of feverish discourse overshadows other important research areas in AI.  That’s a shame, because Gato is an interesting step. Some models have started to mix different skills: DALL-E, for example, generates images from text descriptions. Others use a single training technique to learn to recognize pictures and sentences. And DeepMind's AlphaZero learned to play Go, chess, and shogi.  But here’s the crucial difference: AlphaZero could only learn one task at a time. After learning to play Go, it had to forget everything before learning to play chess, and so on. It could not learn to play both games at once. This is what Gato does: it learns multiple different tasks at the same time, which means it can switch between them without having to forget one skill before learning another. It’s a small advance but a significant one. A machine that could think like a person has been the guiding vision of AI research since the earliest days—and remains its most divisive idea. The downside is that Gato doesn’t perform the tasks as well as models that can only do one thing. Robots still need to learn “common-sense knowledge” about how the world works from text, says Jacob Andreas, an assistant professor at MIT who specializes in artificial intelligence and natural-language and speech processing.    This could come in handy in robots that could help people around the house, for example. “When you drop [a robot] into a kitchen and ask them to make a cup of tea for the first time, they know what steps are involved in making a cup of tea and in which cabinet tea bags are likely to be located,” says Andreas.  Some external researchers were explicitly dismissive of de Freitas’s claim. “This is far from being ‘intelligent,’” says Gary Marcus, an AI researcher who has been critical of deep learning. The hype around Gato demonstrates that the field of AI is blighted by an unhelpful “triumphalist culture,” he says. The deep-learning models that often generate the most excitement about the potential to reach human-level intelligence make mistakes that “if a human made these errors, you’d be like, something’s wrong with this person,” Marcus says.  “Nature is trying to tell us something here, which is this doesn’t really work, but the field is so believing its own press clippings that it just can’t see that,” he adds.  Even de Freitas’s DeepMind colleagues Jackie Kay and Scott Reed, who worked with him on Gato, were more circumspect when I asked them directly about his claims. When asked whether Gato was heading toward AGI, they wouldn’t be drawn. “I don’t actually think it’s really feasible to make predictions with these kinds of things. I try to avoid that. It’s like predicting the stock market,” said Kay. Reed said the question was a difficult one: “I think most machine-learning people will studiously avoid answering. Very hard to predict, but, you know, hopefully we get there someday.” In a way, the fact that DeepMind called Gato a “generalist” might have made it a victim of the AI sector’s excessive hype around AGI. The AI systems of today are called “narrow,” meaning they can only do a specific, restricted set of tasks such as generate text.  Some technologists, including some at DeepMind, think that one day humans will develop “broader” AI systems that will be able to function as well as or even better than humans. Though some call this artificial general intelligence, others say it is like ""belief in magic.“ Many top researchers, such as Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, question whether it is even possible at all. Gato is a “generalist” in the sense that it can do many different things at the same time. But that is a world apart from a “general” AI that can meaningfully adapt to new tasks that are different from what the model was trained on, says MIT’s Andreas: “We’re still quite far from being able to do that.” Making models bigger will also not address the issue that models don’t have “lifelong learning,” which would mean that if taught something once, they would understand all the implications and use it to inform all the other decisions they make, he says. The hype around tools like Gato is harmful for the general development of AI, argues Emmanuel Kahembwe, an AI and robotics researcher and part of the Black in AI organization cofounded by Timnit Gebru. “There are many interesting topics that are left to the side, that are underfunded, that deserve more attention, but that’s not what the big tech companies and the bulk of researchers in such tech companies are interested in,” he says. Tech companies ought to take a step back and take stock of why they are building what they are building, says Vilas Dhar, president of the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, a charity that funds AI projects “for good.”  “AGI speaks to something deeply human—the idea that we can become more than we are, by building tools that propel us to greatness,” he says. “And that’s really nice, except it also is a way to distract us from the fact that we have real problems that face us today that we should be trying to address using AI.” ","Earlier this month, DeepMind presented a new “generalist” AI model called Gato.

AI technologies have emerged as the only viable way to turn this data into information. As more computing produces more data, more computing power is needed to power AI. Next generation AI will soon look to planetary-scale computing systems to further fuel AI’s computational requirements. We’ll examine some of the technologies, such as neuromorphic and quantum computing, that will unlock the next step in performance that is intractable with current computing systems. Arun Subramaniyan joined Intel to lead the Cloud & AI Strategy team. Arun joined Intel from AWS, where he led the global solutions team for Machine Learning, Quantum Computing, High Performance Computing (HPC), Autonomous Vehicles, and Autonomous Computing at AWS. His team was responsible for developing solutions across all areas of HPC, quantum computing, and large-scale machine learning applications, spanning $1.5B+ portfolio. Arun founded and grew the global teams for Autonomous Computing and Quantum Computing Go-to-market and solutions at AWS and grew the businesses 2-3x. Arun’s primary areas of research focus are Bayesian methods, global optimization, probabilistic deep learning for large scale applications, and distributed computing. He enjoys working at the intersection of massively parallel computing and modeling large-scale systems. Before AWS, Arun founded and led the AI products team at GE’s Oil & Gas division and grew the digital products business successfully. He and his team developed deep learning-augmented hybrid analytics for all segments of the oil & gas industry. Arun led the development of the Digital Twin platform for GE at GE’s Global Research Center. The platform continues to enable several thousand engineers to build advanced models efficiently. The asset specific cumulative damage modeling techniques he and his team pioneered define the standard for industrial damage modeling. As a Six Sigma Master Black Belt, he developed advanced techniques and tools for efficiently modeling large scale systems like jet engine fleets, gas turbines in powerplants, and accelerated design times by 3-4X. Arun is a prolific researcher with a Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering from Purdue University with 19 granted patents (54 filed), and 50+ international publications that have been cited more than 1000 times with an h-index of 13. He is also a recipient of the Hull Award from GE, which honors technologists for their outstanding technical impact.

Meta has built a massive new language AI—and it’s giving it away for free,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/05/03/1051691/meta-ai-large-language-model-gpt3-ethics-huggingface-transparency/,2022-05-03,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Facebook’s parent company is inviting researchers to pore over and pick apart the flaws in its version of GPT-3</span></p>
","Meta’s AI lab has created a massive new language model that shares both the remarkable abilities and the harmful flaws of OpenAI’s pioneering neural network GPT-3. And in an unprecedented move for Big Tech, it is giving it away to researchers—together with details about how it was built and trained. “We strongly believe that the ability for others to scrutinize your work is an important part of research. We really invite that collaboration,” says Joelle Pineau, a longtime advocate for transparency in the development of technology, who is now managing director at Meta AI. Meta’s move is the first time that a fully trained large language model will be made available to any researcher who wants to study it. The news has been welcomed by many concerned about the way this powerful technology is being built by small teams behind closed doors. “I applaud the transparency here,” says Emily M. Bender, a computational linguist at the University of Washington and a frequent critic of the way language models are developed and deployed.   “It’s a great move,” says Thomas Wolf, chief scientist at Hugging Face, the AI startup behind BigScience, a project in which more than 1,000 volunteers around the world are collaborating on an open-source language model. “The more open models the better,” he says.  Large language models—powerful programs that can generate paragraphs of text and mimic human conversation—have become one of the hottest trends in AI in the last couple of years. But they have deep flaws, parroting misinformation, prejudice, and toxic language. In theory, putting more people to work on the problem should help. Yet because language models require vast amounts of data and computing power to train, they have so far remained projects for rich tech firms. The wider research community, including ethicists and social scientists concerned about their misuse, has had to watch from the sidelines.   Meta AI says it wants to change that. “Many of us have been university researchers,” says Pineau. “We know the gap that exists between universities and industry in terms of the ability to build these models. Making this one available to researchers was a no-brainer.” She hopes that others will pore over their work and pull it apart or build on it. Breakthroughs come faster when more people are involved, she says. Meta is making its model, called Open Pretrained Transformer (OPT), available for non-commercial use. It is also releasing its code and a logbook that documents the training process. The logbook contains daily updates from members of the team about the training data: how it was added to the model and when, what worked and what didn’t. In more than 100 pages of notes, the researchers log every bug, crash, and reboot in a three-month training process that ran nonstop from October 2021 to January 2022. With 175 billion parameters (the values in a neural network that get tweaked during training), OPT is the same size as GPT-3. This was by design, says Pineau. The team built OPT to match GPT-3 both in its accuracy on language tasks and in its toxicity. OpenAI has made GPT-3 available as a paid service but has not shared the model itself or its code. The idea was to provide researchers with a similar language model to study, says Pineau. OpenAI declined an invitation to comment on Meta’s announcement.  Google, which is exploring the use of large language models in its search products, has also been criticized for a lack of transparency. The company sparked controversy in 2020 when it forced out leading members of its AI ethics team after they produced a study that highlighted problems with the technology.   So why is Meta doing this? After all, Meta is a company that has said little about how the algorithms behind Facebook and Instagram work and has a reputation for burying unfavorable findings by its own in-house research teams. A big reason for the different approach by Meta AI is Pineau herself, who has been pushing for more transparency in AI for a number of years. Tech giants dominate research but the line between real breakthrough and product showcase can be fuzzy. Some scientists have had enough. Pineau helped change how research is published in several of the largest conferences, introducing a checklist of things that researchers must submit alongside their results, including code and details about how experiments are run. Since she joined Meta (then Facebook) in 2017, she has championed that culture in its AI lab.  “That commitment to open science is why I’m here,” she says. “I wouldn’t be here on any other terms.” Ultimately, Pineau wants to change how we judge AI. “What we call state-of-the-art nowadays can’t just be about performance,” she says. “It has to be state-of-the-art in terms of responsibility as well.” Still, giving away a large language model is a bold move for Meta. “I can’t tell you that there’s no risk of this model producing language that we’re not proud of,” says Pineau. “It will.” Margaret Mitchell, one of the AI ethics researchers Google forced out in 2020, who is now at Hugging Face, sees the release of OPT as a positive move. But she thinks there are limits to transparency. Has the language model been tested with sufficient rigor? Do the foreseeable benefits outweigh the foreseeable harms—such as the generation of misinformation, or racist and misogynistic language?  “Releasing a large language model to the world where a wide audience is likely to use it, or be affected by its output, comes with responsibilities,” she says. Mitchell notes that this model will be able to generate harmful content not only by itself, but through downstream applications that researchers build on top of it. Meta AI audited OPT to remove some harmful behaviors, but the point is to release a model that researchers can learn from, warts and all, says Pineau. “There were a lot of conversations about how to do that in a way that lets us sleep at night, knowing that there’s a non-zero risk in terms of reputation, a non-zero risk in terms of harm,” she says. She dismisses the idea that you should not release a model because it’s too dangerous—which is the reason OpenAI gave for not releasing GPT-3’s predecessor, GPT-2. “I understand the weaknesses of these models, but that’s not a research mindset,” she says. Hundreds of scientists around the world are working together to understand one of the most powerful emerging technologies before it’s too late. Bender, who coauthored the study at the center of the Google dispute with Mitchell, is also concerned about how the potential harms will be handled. “One thing that is really key in mitigating the risks of any kind of machine-learning technology is to ground evaluations and explorations in specific use cases,” she says. “What will the system be used for? Who will be using it, and how will the system outputs be presented to them?” Some researchers question why large language models are being built at all, given their potential for harm. For Pineau, these concerns should be met with more exposure, not less. “I believe the only way to build trust is extreme transparency,” she says. “We have different opinions around the world about what speech is appropriate, and AI is a part of that conversation,” she says. She doesn’t expect language models to say things that everyone agrees with. “But how do we grapple with that? You need many voices in that discussion.” ","Meta’s AI lab has created a massive new language model that shares both the remarkable abilities and the harmful flaws of OpenAI’s pioneering neural network GPT-3. And in an unprecedented move for Big Tech, it is giving it away to researchers—together with details about how it was built and trained. “We strongly believe that the ability for others to scrutinize your work is an important part of research. We really invite that collaboration,” says Joelle Pineau, a longtime advocate for transparency in the development of technology, who is now managing director at Meta AI. Meta’s move is the first time that a fully trained large language model will be made available to any researcher who wants to study it. The news has been welcomed by many concerned about the way this powerful technology is being built by small teams behind closed doors. “I applaud the transparency here,” says Emily M. Bender, a computational linguist at the University of Washington and a frequent critic of the way language models are developed and deployed. “It’s a great move,” says Thomas Wolf, chief scientist at Hugging Face, the AI startup behind BigScience, a project in which more than 1,000 volunteers around the world are collaborating on an open-source language model. “The more open models the better,” he says. Large language models—powerful programs that can generate paragraphs of text and mimic human conversation—have become one of the hottest trends in AI in the last couple of years. But they have deep flaws, parroting misinformation, prejudice, and toxic language. In theory, putting more people to work on the problem should help.

The big story This company delivers packages faster than Amazon, but workers pay the price June 2021 Early one morning in October 2020, 27-year-old Jang Deok-joon came home after working his overnight shift at South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang and jumped into the shower. He had worked at the company’s warehouse in the southern city of Daegu for a little over a year, hauling crates full of items ready to be shipped to delivery hubs. When he didn’t come out of the bathroom for over an hour and a half, his father opened the door to find him unconscious and curled in a ball in the bathtub, his arms tucked tightly into his chest. He was rushed to the hospital, but with no pulse and failing to breathe on his own, doctors pronounced him dead at 9:09 a.m. The coroner ruled that he had died from a heart attack. Jang was the third Coupang worker to die that year, adding to growing concern about the nature of the company’s success. And it has been astoundingly successful: rising to become South Korea’s third-largest employer in just a few years, harnessing a vast network of warehouses, 37,000 workers, a fleet of drivers, and a suite of AI-driven tools to take a commanding position in South Korea's crowded ecommerce market.Coupang’s proprietary AI algorithms calculate everything from the most efficient way to stack packages in delivery trucks, to the precise route and order of deliveries for drivers. In warehouses, AI anticipates purchases and calculates shipping deadlines for outbound packages, allowing it to promise delivery in less than a day for millions of items. Such innovations are why Coupang confidently bills itself as the “future of ecommerce,” and were the driving force behind its recent launch on Nasdaq—the biggest US IPO by an Asian company since Alibaba in 2014. But what does all this innovation and efficiency mean for the company’s workers? Read the full story. —Max S.

When he didn’t come out of the bathroom for over an hour and a half, his father opened the door to find him unconscious and curled in a ball in the bathtub, his arms tucked tightly into his chest. He was rushed to the hospital, but with no pulse and failing to breathe on his own, doctors pronounced him dead at 9:09 a.m. The coroner ruled that he had died from a heart attack. Jang was the third Coupang worker to die that year, adding to growing concern about the nature of the company’s success. And it has been astoundingly successful: rising to become South Korea’s third-largest employer in just a few years, harnessing a vast network of warehouses, 37,000 workers, a fleet of drivers, and a suite of AI-driven tools to take a commanding position in South Korea's crowded ecommerce market.Coupang’s proprietary AI algorithms calculate everything from the most efficient way to stack packages in delivery trucks, to the precise route and order of deliveries for drivers. In warehouses, AI anticipates purchases and calculates shipping deadlines for outbound packages, allowing it to promise delivery in less than a day for millions of items. Such innovations are why Coupang confidently bills itself as the “future of ecommerce,” and were the driving force behind its recent launch on Nasdaq—the biggest US IPO by an Asian company since Alibaba in 2014. But what does all this innovation and efficiency mean for the company’s workers? Read the full story. —Max S.

Why people are trolling their spam texts,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/06/20/1054435/people-trolling-spam-texts/,2022-06-20,"<p>Our phones are being inundated with text scams. Some people are using humor to fight back.</p>
","The other night, I received a mysterious WhatsApp message. “Dr. Kevin?” it began, the question mark suggesting the sender felt bad for interrupting my evening. “My puppy is very slow and won’t eat dog food. Can you make an appointment for me?” I was mystified. My name is not Kevin, I am not a veterinarian, and I was in no position to help this person and their puppy. I nearly typed out a response saying “Sorry, wrong number” when I realized this was probably a scam to get me to confirm my number. I did not respond, but many others who received similar texts have. Some are even throwing it back at their spammers by spinning wild tales and sending hilarious messages to frustrate whoever is on the other side. They’re fighting back with snark, and in some cases posting screenshots of their conversations online.  Spam texts are on the rise, and so are the number of people who are striking back through “scambaiting,” which refers to “the act of wasting an offender’s time,” says Jack Whittaker, a PhD student in sociology at the University of Surrey who is studying the phenomenon. However, experts say responding defeats the point, as it opens a person up to even more spam texts. Spam texts seeking to scam their recipients into giving up valuable information are not new. Some of the earliest digital spam was sent via email chain letters, the most notorious being for scams in which someone impersonating a Nigerian prince claimed to need the receiver’s help in depositing a large sum of money.  Once smartphones became common, scammers switched to texting. And in 2022, spam texts are much more personal. Often they mimic a misdirected text, perhaps addressing the receiver by the wrong name or using a generic first line (“How’s it going” or “I had fun tonight!” are common) to prompt a response. If you’ve received any such messages lately, you’re not alone. “There’s been an incredible spike in spam texts,” says J. Michael Skiba, a professor at Colorado State University who specializes in cybercrime and international financial fraud. Globally, 90 billion of them were sent last year, he says; in the US, 47 billion spam texts were sent from January to October 2021, up 55% from that same period in 2020. According to RoboKiller, a spam blocking firm, scam texts led to $86 million in losses in the US alone in 2020. “People are just bombarded with these,” Skiba says. Skiba says texting has several advantages over email from a scammer’s perspective—a note from a phone number raises less suspicion than one from a sketchy email address, and the casual nature of texting makes grammatical errors less noticeable. Many people also feel a very human urge to respond to a text. “It’s a psychological trick in that you know the text is not correct, but it appeals to your desire to help and say, ‘You’ve got the wrong number,’” Skiba says.  The person on the other side, however, is most likely working with an organized group of scammers in a call center and hoping you say exactly that. A single response is enough for a scammer to verify that a phone number is real. That response leads to a domino effect that could invite even more spam texts to your phone. Ultimately, scammers are looking to at least verify your number to potentially sell it to other groups; getting your personal information is a sweet bonus.  “I would 100% recommend not responding at all,” Skiba says.  But a scroll through Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, and TikTok shows that people aren’t taking that advice. Instead, many are engaging with spam texters and posting their conversations for the world to see. Gabriel Bosslet, an associate professor of medicine in Indianapolis, decided to mess with a recent spam texter by firing off increasingly outlandish replies. He’s been doing this kind of thing since the early 2000s, when he started writing back to mysterious emails that were clearly Nigerian prince scams. Once it’s clear he’s corresponding with a scammer, Bosslet goes into troll mode, fabricating fanciful stories and characters—the more bizarre, the better. “None of it is true,” he says. “I just make it all up.” I like having fun with spam texts pic.twitter.com/izU7i4VDtR Asked what his goal is in these conversations, Bosslet says it’s just to connect and interact with a stranger. He brings up the example of Wanda Dench, a grandmother who accidentally texted then-17-year-old Jamal Hinton an invitation to Thanksgiving dinner that has turned into a sweet annual tradition. “I realize that’s super odd, but I am open to some sort of interaction like that,” he says.  Jason Tanamor, an author from Portland, Oregon, has also started texting spammers back. And, like Bosslet, he isn’t trying to reform anyone. “I just try to get them to say ‘deez nuts’ because it makes me giggle,” Tanamor says. For him, chatting up a spammer can be fun; if he has time, he simply tries to keep the conversation going for as long as he can.  A post shared by Jason Tanamor is writing a pilot. (@jasontanamor) Neither Bosslet nor Tanamor was aware that answering spam texts probably verified their number, allowing their spammers to sell it to other spammers—resulting in even more spam texts. But neither cares. For them, messaging back with outlandish jokes is a form of entertainment. And both expressed empathy for the people on the other side of the phone.  But others have a more vengeful approach. Whittaker at the University of Surrey says some people have taken scambaiting to extremes, joining online forums where they create elaborate hoaxes to trap the perpetrators. That can be dangerous, he says. “Scambaiting can also [lead to] hacking into an offender’s computer as a form of public entertainment,” he says. That’s problematic, possibly exposing people’s private information, and it’s also illegal, despite the moral high ground scambaiters may claim.  Three top livestreaming personalities on the platform Taobao commanded legions of fans who bought billions of dollars’ worth of goods—until they suddenly went dark. Whittaker cites Jim Browning, the alias of a YouTuber and software engineer who has used scambaiting to delete stolen files from call centers involved in spam texts. Other scammers who have been exposed by people like Browning have retaliated by swatting scambaiters (making a false crime report to call out law enforcement) or luring them to dangerous locales.  “Scambaiting activities can become quite radical,” Whittaker says. “Also, scammers wise up to these tactics quickly, so wasting an offender’s time can actually teach them to become more wise to the efforts to waste their time.” It’s a dilemma for people who mess with a scammer. It can be satisfying, if only as a form of rebellion against an annoying modern intrusion. But that rebellion can be costly, in terms of both the time it takes and the risk of setting off an avalanche of future spam texts that could, if scambaiters fall for them, put them at risk of financial or personal ruin.  The US Federal Trade Commission and consumer advocates have attempted to fight back with Do Not Call registries and efforts to stop spam texts at the network level, but spammers are constantly evolving their tactics to bypass these laws. That can make it feel as though there’s only one way to handle the frustrating situation: with a joke about “deez nuts.” ","The other night, I received a mysterious WhatsApp message. “Dr. Kevin?” it began, the question mark suggesting the sender felt bad for interrupting my evening. “My puppy is very slow and won’t eat dog food.

Now China wants to censor online comments,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/06/18/1054452/china-censors-social-media-comments/,2022-06-18,"<p>A draft update of rules would dramatically increase the power of China’s censorship machine, but platforms will pay the price.</p>
","China is fine-tuning its censorship machine, this time proposing changes in how to regulate the billions of online comments posted in the country every day. On June 17, the internet regulator Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) published a draft update on the responsibilities of platforms and content creators in managing online comments. One line stands out: all online comments would have to be pre-reviewed before being published. Users and observers are worried that the move could be used to further tighten freedom of expression in China. The new changes affect Provisions on the Management of Internet Post Comments Services, a regulation that first came into effect in 2017. Five years later, the Cyberspace Administration wants to bring it up to date.  “The proposed revisions primarily update the current version of the comment rules to bring them into line with the language and policies of more recent authority, such as new laws on the protection of personal information, data security, and general content regulations,” says Jeremy Daum, a senior fellow at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center.  The provisions cover many types of comments, including anything from forum posts, replies, messages left on public message boards, and “bullet chats” (an innovative way that video platforms in China use to display real-time comments on top of a video). All formats, including texts, symbols, GIFs, pictures, audio, and videos, fall under this regulation.  There’s a need for a stand-alone regulation on comments because the vast number makes them difficult to censor as rigorously as other content, like articles or videos, says Eric Liu, a former censor for Weibo who’s now researching Chinese censorship at China Digital Times.  “One thing everyone in the censorship industry knows is that nobody pays attention to the replies and bullet chats. They are moderated carelessly, with minimum effort,” Liu says.  But recently, there have been several awkward cases where comments under government Weibo accounts went rogue, pointing out government lies or rejecting the official narrative. That could be what has prompted the regulator’s proposed update. Chinese social platforms are currently on the front lines of censorship work, often actively removing posts before the government and other users can even see them. ByteDance famously employs thousands of content reviewers, who make up the largest number of employees at the company. Other companies outsource the task to “censorship-for-hire” firms, including one owned by China’s party mouthpiece People’s Daily. The platforms are frequently punished for letting things slip. Beijing is constantly refining its social media control, mending loopholes and introducing new restrictions. But the vagueness of the latest revisions makes people worry that the government may ignore practical challenges. For example, if the new rule about mandating pre-publish reviews is to be strictly enforced—which would require reading billions of public messages posted by Chinese users every day—it will force the platforms to dramatically increase the number of people they employ to carry out censorship. The tricky question is, no one knows if the government intends to enforce this immediately. One specific change about “先审后发,” a censoring practice some Chinese social media platforms use to review content before it’s even published, has particularly caught people’s attention. On Weibo, the popular Twitter-like service, such stricter control measures are currently applied only to accounts that have violated content censorship rules before, or when there’s an ongoing heated discussion about a sensitive topic. The 2017 version limited such actions to “comments under news information,” so it didn’t need to be applied universally. But the new update takes out that restriction. On social media, some Chinese users are worried that this means the practice can be expanded to cover every single comment online. Under one Weibo post about the change, the most liked comment says, “Is this restriction necessary? If only there’s a guarantee it won’t be abused.”  That is an extreme interpretation of the proposed change, says Liu, because censoring every comment would incur astronomical costs to social media platforms. It’s unlikely Beijing will go so far to enforce blanket pre-publish censorship, but Liu says the revisions are more likely intended to force platforms to take more responsibility in moderating the comments section, which has traditionally been ignored. Whether there is a pre-publish censorship system in place can determine where online social protests break out. In April, a video about the Shanghai covid lockdown went viral on WeChat Channels but not Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok—partly because the latter platform reviews every video before it’s published, while the former didn’t at the time. The regulator is now seeking public comments on the proposed revisions until July 1, 2022, and they may not take effect for many months. Right now, discussions about how strictly they will be enforced are only speculative. But it’s clear that China is identifying the Great Firewall’s loopholes and updating its regulations to address them. The most recent changes are “unapologetically part of China's continued expansion of content regulations beyond mainstream media to now cover user content generated through comments and other interactive features,” says Daum. The changes will also expand who can censor online comments. CAC now asks that platforms share the power of censoring comments with content creators—in Chinese internet lingo, “public account operators.” Currently, government-affiliated accounts are already empowered to do this on sites like Weibo. If this revision becomes law, creators will also become part of the censorship machine, responsible for identifying “illegal or negative” content and reporting it.  “Although China’s internet is one of the most censored in the world, there is still some space for discussing sensitive topics. People can play a clever cat-and-mouse game with censors and make creative adjustments once posts are censored,” says William Nee, research and advocacy coordinator at Chinese Human Rights Defenders.  “However, the new system could make that next to impossible and tighten the already limited space for freedom of expression on sensitive topics even further.”  ","China is fine-tuning its censorship machine, this time proposing changes in how to regulate the billions of online comments posted in the country every day.

Inside the experimental world of animal infrastructure,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/06/16/1053631/inside-animal-infrastructure/,2022-06-16,"<p>Wildlife crossings cut down on roadkill. But are they really a boon for conservation?</p>
","In the mid-2000s, toads were meeting a gruesome end near Ede, an old, leafy town in the middle of the Netherlands. Local residents came to the rescue. For a few weeks each spring, the town erected a set of temporary fences along a kilometer or so of road, in an area where the animals crossed over from their winter habitat in the south to three breeding ponds in the north. When the toads hit the barrier, they’d hop sideways for a few meters until they dropped into a bucket, one of 36 pitfall traps that lined the fence.  Every day, volunteers would diligently carry the toads to the other side and send them on their way. It was a crude, somewhat laborious way of mitigating the hardship of being an amphibian in a world built for humans. But it was a lifeline that Ede residents were happy to provide for their warty neighbors—which, like so many other species worldwide, have suffered difficulties feeding, breeding, and migrating as their familiar landscape is carved apart by human infrastructure.  What followed has taken on the air of a cautionary fable among a small international community of ecologists and ecological designers. A few years in, Ede decided to swap its ad hoc screens for permanent barriers and replace the three dozen buckets with a pair of wildlife tunnels passing under the road. For ecologist Edgar van der Grift and other scientists monitoring the change, it was clear that the underpasses were popular. Many toads hopped happily toward their breeding ponds—even finding occasion to copulate mid-journey, a 2019 study notes.  But when the researchers studied the effect that this new infrastructure was having on the toad population, they were alarmed by the results. “We saw a crash,” says van der Grift, one of the world’s leading experts in wildlife crossing structures. “In five, six years, the population went down from over 10,000 individuals to less than 1,000.” In the years since, van der Grift has persuaded Ede to add a third tunnel, in a heavily frequented spot along the road. But discussions are still ongoing about how to reverse Ede’s dwindling numbers. For advocates of wildlife crossings, any such sign of failure inevitably sets alarm bells ringing far and wide. Countries have started to invest big in these bridges and tunnels. President Biden’s November infrastructure bill allocated a landmark $350 million investment in animal crossings across the US, where some estimate roughly 1 million vertebrate animals die each day. In April, the National Wildlife Federation broke ground on a pioneering urban bridge—a $90 million custom-designed acre of “wilderness” that will float across 10 lanes of the US 101 freeway, linking two islands of mountain lion habitat north of Los Angeles. Early adopters Canada and the Netherlands are already home to decades-old networks of road-spanning projects, with arcs of chaotic forest reaching over highways. Australia, Brazil, China, and South Africa are following suit, hoping they can avoid the fate of seeing natural habitats sliced into sickly, disjointed fragments. Around the world, cities are building a huge variety of structures intended to mitigate the impacts of urbanization and roadbuilding on wildlife. The list includes green roofs, tree-lined skyscrapers, living seawalls, artificial wetlands, and all manner of shelters and “hibernacula,” including 3D-printed hempcrete birdboxes for endangered owls in Melbourne and gigantic bat caves constructed like earthen igloos in the Texas hills. But the data on how effective these approaches are remains patchy and unclear. That is true even for wildlife crossings, the best-studied and most heavily funded example of such animal infrastructure. Though road ecologists know these crossings can play a vital role in reducing roadkill, the story of their impact on wildlife conservation is still being told. This question is only growing more urgent: to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2040, a projected $97 trillion “tsunami” of new roads, railways, pipelines, and power lines will be needed, which would in effect double human infrastructure from 2012 levels, according to the World Wildlife Fund. That would put even more pressure on global biodiversity; one-sixth of all species at risk of extinction are threatened by human infrastructure development. Wildlife crossings certainly look like success stories. Every day, remote-sensing cameras beam back images of animals taking advantage of them. There are the eager pioneers, like roe deer and foxes, which cross even before construction is completed. There are shy holdouts, like gray wolves or grizzly bears, which might take generations to become users. At Singapore’s Mandai Wildlife Bridge, a total of 70 species—including pangolins, sambar deer, long-tailed macaques, fruit bats, and red jungle fowl (a close relative of the domestic chicken)—have crossed the road.  “Ten seconds after they’re open, there’s animals using them,” says Darryl Jones, the author of A Clouded Leopard in the Middle of the Road, which tells the stories of deadly highways and lifesaving crossings from Brisbane, Australia, to Alberta, Canada. “The big new question now is—and this is the valid question—So what? Does that actually make a difference?” It takes less than half an hour by train to get from Amsterdam to the Gooi, a region of historic villages and medieval fortified settlements that’s home to the Dutch TV industry. But this short ride takes you across one of the most intensively engineered landscapes on earth: over railroad girder bridges, across shipping canals, past windmills—both ancient stone structures and today’s tubular steel turbines—and expanses of fields created by the polder-dike system that transformed the country’s natural marshy wetlands into productive farmland. For those interested in learning about the limits of wildlife crossings, the Gooi is a good place to start. The region boasts one of the world’s densest collections of such infrastructure, with four bridges, two major underpasses, and a network of tunnels for badgers, amphibians, and reptiles, all within about 10 minutes’ drive from the quaint local capital of Hilversum. Despite millions of dollars in losses, iBuying’s failure doesn’t signal the end of tech-led disruption, just a fumbled beginning. As van der Grift walks along the deck of one of these bridges, he points out fox droppings, blue herons, and trails where groups of roe deer walk in single file, retracing their footsteps each day. From this point, atop the bridge, the six-lane highway below is invisible, shielded by the raised banks or “berms” on either side. But it can be heard, despite efforts to dampen the noise with the foliage of local beech and spruce. The crossing is studded with ponds, close enough together for toads to comfortably hop their way from one to the next.  The Netherlands built its first wildlife bridges to stop deer from becoming roadkill. But in the 1990s, the country began to shift to a more holistic ecological mindset, using bridges to link fragments of protected areas. In 2005 the Dutch parliament made such “defragmentation” a long-term nationwide policy, known as MJPO in Dutch. The program marked a shift to a strategic conservation-driven agenda, one that prioritized helping a broad sweep of species—including reptiles, bats, and butterflies—to move across the human-altered landscape. In modeling carried out for the Dutch transport ministry, van der Grift identified 215 bottlenecks where species struggled to pass, flagging them as places where crossings could make the greatest difference. Today there are 70 wildlife bridges in the country and more than 2,000 other structures, such as badger tunnels, rope bridges between trees, and aquatic underpasses.  To understand the real value a bridge has, it is important to step back and see the damage that arrives with each tarmac carriageway, says van der Grift, a gentle giant with a dry sense of humor earned in two decades of trying—with mixed results—to thwart animals’ seemingly insatiable desire to throw themselves under cars. A road forms a barrier, one that animals either can’t or do not want to traverse. “It inhibits animals to cross and to get in contact with each other,” van der Grift says. The effects go far beyond roadkill. If the barrier is significant enough, it can make entire animal populations less viable, prone to inbreeding and decline.  Wildlife crossings can reduce this barrier effect, the thinking goes, making the road more permeable for a range of species. But few studies so far have been able to say conclusively whether this is really happening or not, he explains.  The devil is in the details. In the case of Ede, for example, there was plenty of amphibian traffic in the toad tunnels. But there were not enough structures—just two tunnels initially, hundreds of meters apart, rather than the 10 or more that scientists had recommended. “Many toads that move along the barrier and want to cross the road to get to the breeding pond—they basically gave up because they didn’t encounter a crossing structure early enough,” says Marcel Huijser, a leading US-based road ecologist and a longtime friend of van der Grift’s.  Unexpected impacts and side effects crop up at nearly every crossing. Underpasses—often considered a cheaper alternative—seem to be less popular with many species and are rarely used by butterflies. Many aquatic mammals won’t swim into a tunnel where they can’t see the other end, but they can be convinced to walk through the same tunnel if a narrow ledge is built above the waterline. On one bridge in the Gooi, a big buck unexpectedly took over, exerting a territorial effect outside of rutting seasons. He acts as a gatekeeper, allowing does to cross but shutting off access to most males. At the bridge we are standing on, van der Grift is tracking slow worms, armless and legless reptiles that wobble forward like clumsy snakes. Decades after being split by the road and railways, the populations on the east and west sides of the highway had developed distinct genetic profiles. When the bridge opened in 2016, he hoped to see the two populations start to mix. And indeed, DNA testing suggests they are. “We see now that the genetic patterns of the populations are getting closer to each other,” he says. “So there is exchange.”  But the ultimate goal is to ensure self-sustaining, healthy, viable animal populations. And it’s still unclear whether the defragmentation efforts are accomplishing that. Van der Grift says he and colleagues wrote a plan for a nationwide empirical evaluation of the MJPO program around a decade ago, but it was never funded (MJPO has since concluded and been superseded by other defragmentation plans). Such studies are often considered prohibitively expensive. It can require decades of tracking population sizes to sort the signal from the noise, explains Silviu Petrovan, a zoologist at the University of Cambridge. Some animals, like amphibians, naturally have population numbers that vary greatly from year to year, he says, meaning totals can zigzag “due to reasons that have nothing to do with your mediation.” “We are now at the stage where the data is coming in—it’s really coming through.” One animal that seems to have benefited from Dutch defragmentation policies is the badger. In the 1980s there were fewer than 1,200 of them nationwide. Since the country began building under-road “badger pipes,” their numbers have more than tripled. Models by van der Grift’s team strongly indicate that the tunnels have a positive effect on population viability. But no robust scientific study has been carried out to prove it, he says. That would entail decades of population monitoring. The Netherlands is not alone in its limited assessment of the impact of wildlife crossings. “Even when we do enough, we don’t do the research for long enough, funded well enough—including a ‘before’ setting, including control settings—to be able to conclude that we actually reached our objectives,” Petrovan says. Many crossing projects don’t even reach the point of clearly defining the objectives they set out to achieve, he says. Jones strikes a more optimistic tone. “We are now at the stage where the data is coming in—it’s really coming through,” he says. He’s particularly encouraged by the ability to do genetic testing: “We’ve got very profoundly useful and effective ways to assess this stuff.” Historically, in the US, conservation has not been the point of animal crossings. Wildlife bridges have so far been seen almost exclusively as traffic safety tools: two dozen or so overpasses built at hot spots for migrating deer and elk. Threatened smaller species barely register among the diverse victims of the highway. “Amphibians? Reptiles? Please …” says van der Grift, summing up how such concerns are typically laughed away.  Most studies of US crossings have tracked their impact on road collisions and insurance claims. There, they excel: “When sited correctly, with appropriate fencing, to the target species, we know what wildlife crossings work well over 90% of the time,” says Nina-Marie Lister, who leads the Ecological Design Lab at Ryerson University in Toronto. “They avoid 90 to 95% of wildlife vehicle collisions. That’s an astonishing number in the world of science.”  Clockwise from top left: California’s mountain lions, Kenya’s elephants, Singapore’s pangolins, and the Netherlands’ amphibians are among the focal points of wildlife crossing developments. The reduction in property damage and human injury can be significant. In the mid-2010s, for example, a project on State Highway 9 in Grand County, Colorado, added two wildlife bridges, five large arch underpasses, and 10.4 miles of wildlife fencing at a cost of $10 million. The result was an 89% reduction in roadkill. The Center for Large Landscape Conservation, a nonprofit working on ecological connectivity, projected that the crossings would pay for themselves in approximately 22 years, less than a third of the structures’ planned 75-year life span. But if the goal is simply to stop animals from being hit by cars, there is no need for a bridge. “You simply could put a fence and prevent them from going entirely, and your mortality would drop to zero,” says Petrovan, who conducts research on wildlife crossings for Conservation Evidence, a database of scientific findings about conservation actions. “It helps us feel better, because we see fewer individuals killed. But for the population, it doesn’t actually give any benefits,” he says.  Huijser says the US has been less inclined than his native Netherlands—and “almost anywhere else I’ve worked”—to think about conservation as a goal of crossings. But that is changing. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which was signed into law in November and has allocated $350 million for wildlife crossings for the next five years, ​​provides new federal funding for projects and research to reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions as well as connect fragmented areas of habitat. Although that amount is just 0.3% of the bill’s $110 billion budget for roads, road ecologists have hailed it as a landmark investment. There is now a publicly funded way to build crossings that target conservation goals, even though collision reduction remains the primary focus, says Rob Ament, senior conservationist at the Center for Large Landscape Conservation. The dedicated funding also means wildlife crossings are no longer competing with potholes for scarce tax dollars. “I think it’s actually a huge step forward,” Ament says. The bill acknowledges that we need to design infrastructure “with both things in mind: the needs of people—the movement of goods and people—but also the movement of wildlife,” he says. “And finally, we’re doing that.” But what to build? North America’s most influential examples of crossings lie along the Rocky Mountain Front in Canada. The area, which boasts the richest diversity of large mammals on the continent, is bisected by the Trans-Canada Highway. At Banff National Park, a set of 44 wildlife crossings (six overpasses and 38 underpasses) have been built to bridge the gap, creating a linked-up system used by a wide range of species including elk, cougars, and coyotes, as well as rarer animals such as red fox, grizzly bears, wolves, wolverines, snakes, beavers, and lynx.  But Banff’s wildlife crossings, like most, suffer from a sort of Horseless Carriage Syndrome, their designs circumscribed by existing infrastructure. Tunnels are often little-adapted culverts, the (usually concrete) tubes that ferry water under roads. And overpasses have generally been borrowed wholesale from roadways—they are built as if they are going to carry the weight of an 18-wheeler and then “top-dressed” with foliage, Lister says.  A scattering of experiments are starting to rethink this model. One is the Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing, the $90 million wildlife bridge under construction north of Los Angeles. Designed by architect Robert Rock, it avoids the humped arch of older bridges in favor of a vast flat expanse that needs just one column to support it between mountains and across a highway traversed each day by an estimated 300,000 cars. It is the “poster child for innovation,” says Renee Callahan, executive director of ARC Solutions, a group that researches how to build better wildlife bridges. “It’s literally designed for species from mountain lions to mule deer to deer mouse,” Callahan says. “They’re designing it all the way down—to literally the mycorrhizal layer, in terms of the soil, to make sure that the soil itself has the fungal network that can support the native vegetation.”  There are many unknowns as construction starts, not least how different species will react to the sheer volume of vehicles passing beneath. The National Park Service will be monitoring activity on the bridge as well as DNA profiles of animals on either side of the freeway. Many are watching to see what will happen with the area’s population of mountain lions. Over time, inbreeding has led to genetic abnormalities, like a telltale kink in local cats’ tails. The agency predicted that the population would become extinct within decades without a crossing. Across the US, the infrastructure bill’s $350 million falls far short of what will be needed to address the fragmentation created by the country’s 4 million miles of public roads. But there are a handful of innovations that could tip the cost-­benefit analysis by allowing crossings to be built at lower cost or in places where it was not feasible before.  Animal bridges are currently built only where there is protected land on both sides of the road, as the typical expense of constructing a concrete bridge would be hard to justify on a site that someone might develop in a few years’ time. Lighter, cheaper, modular systems could be used in places whose futures are less secure, explains Huijser: “If the adjacent lands become unsuitable for wildlife, we take it apart and you can move it.”  One candidate material for such modular systems is precast concrete. There’s also excitement about fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP), a material less dense than concrete that is made from structural fibers set in resin. FRP has been used to build foot and bike bridges in Europe and a quick-and-easy wildlife bridge in Rhenen, just south of the Gooi in the Netherlands. Currently the Federal Highway Administration does not allow it to be used in traffic infrastructure in the US, but there are growing demands for change. “These are barriers that are principally about policy and governance. They’re not about science and they’re not about technology,” says Lister. “They know that the last thing anybody wants is for a big structure, with a lot of publicity, to get built—and then it doesn’t work.” Designers like Lister and innovators like Callahan are vocal proponents of building wildlife bridges across the country. Road ecologists and wildlife scientists, on the other hand, remain more cautious. “They are hypercritical because they know that the last thing anybody wants is for a big structure, with a lot of publicity, to get built—and then it doesn’t work. Because everybody will come out of the woodwork and say, ‘See! Waste of time! Complete crap!’” Jones says.  But today even cautious types want to see more built. Although we may not have conducted enough research to have all the answers, it would be dangerous to take that as a signal we should stop, Huijser says. He calls such over-cautiousness a “type II error”—a false negative. In this time of mass extinction, it is as if the house is burning down and our solution so far has been to squirt a water pistol at it a few times. To conclude that water isn’t the answer would be a mistake.  Despite the challenges in Ede and elsewhere, van der Grift says, the answer is learning while building. We still need to invest in the real work of tagging, installing trail cams, and doing DNA testing and long-term population monitoring, he emphasizes. But we must first build more crossings—and the evidence we have so far says to build big and bold. “You have to realize that you almost cannot do too much,” he says. “You do what you think is necessary, study it, and then, nine out of 10 times, you will see, ‘Oh, I should have done more.’ But there’s no point in waiting until you have figured that out.” Matthew Ponsford is a freelance reporter based in London. ","In the mid-2000s, toads were meeting a gruesome end near Ede, an old, leafy town in the middle of the Netherlands. Local residents came to the rescue. For a few weeks each spring, the town erected a set of temporary fences along a kilometer or so of road, in an area where the animals crossed over from their winter habitat in the south to three breeding ponds in the north. When the toads hit the barrier, they’d hop sideways for a few meters until they dropped into a bucket, one of 36 pitfall traps that lined the fence. Every day, volunteers would diligently carry the toads to the other side and send them on their way. It was a crude, somewhat laborious way of mitigating the hardship of being an amphibian in a world built for humans. But it was a lifeline that Ede residents were happy to provide for their warty neighbors—which, like so many other species worldwide, have suffered difficulties feeding, breeding, and migrating as their familiar landscape is carved apart by human infrastructure. What followed has taken on the air of a cautionary fable among a small international community of ecologists and ecological designers. A few years in, Ede decided to swap its ad hoc screens for permanent barriers and replace the three dozen buckets with a pair of wildlife tunnels passing under the road. For ecologist Edgar van der Grift and other scientists monitoring the change, it was clear that the underpasses were popular. Many toads hopped happily toward their breeding ponds—even finding occasion to copulate mid-journey, a 2019 study notes. But when the researchers studied the effect that this new infrastructure was having on the toad population, they were alarmed by the results. “We saw a crash,” says van der Grift, one of the world’s leading experts in wildlife crossing structures. “In five, six years, the population went down from over 10,000 individuals to less than 1,000.” In the years since, van der Grift has persuaded Ede to add a third tunnel, in a heavily frequented spot along the road. But discussions are still ongoing about how to reverse Ede’s dwindling numbers. For advocates of wildlife crossings, any such sign of failure inevitably sets alarm bells ringing far and wide. Countries have started to invest big in these bridges and tunnels. President Biden’s November infrastructure bill allocated a landmark $350 million investment in animal crossings across the US, where some estimate roughly 1 million vertebrate animals die each day. In April, the National Wildlife Federation broke ground on a pioneering urban bridge—a $90 million custom-designed acre of “wilderness” that will float across 10 lanes of the US 101 freeway, linking two islands of mountain lion habitat north of Los Angeles. Early adopters Canada and the Netherlands are already home to decades-old networks of road-spanning projects, with arcs of chaotic forest reaching over highways. Australia, Brazil, China, and South Africa are following suit, hoping they can avoid the fate of seeing natural habitats sliced into sickly, disjointed fragments. Around the world, cities are building a huge variety of structures intended to mitigate the impacts of urbanization and roadbuilding on wildlife. The list includes green roofs, tree-lined skyscrapers, living seawalls, artificial wetlands, and all manner of shelters and “hibernacula,” including 3D-printed hempcrete birdboxes for endangered owls in Melbourne and gigantic bat caves constructed like earthen igloos in the Texas hills. But the data on how effective these approaches are remains patchy and unclear. That is true even for wildlife crossings, the best-studied and most heavily funded example of such animal infrastructure. Though road ecologists know these crossings can play a vital role in reducing roadkill, the story of their impact on wildlife conservation is still being told. This question is only growing more urgent: to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2040, a projected $97 trillion “tsunami” of new roads, railways, pipelines, and power lines will be needed, which would in effect double human infrastructure from 2012 levels, according to the World Wildlife Fund. That would put even more pressure on global biodiversity; one-sixth of all species at risk of extinction are threatened by human infrastructure development. Wildlife crossings certainly look like success stories. Every day, remote-sensing cameras beam back images of animals taking advantage of them. There are the eager pioneers, like roe deer and foxes, which cross even before construction is completed. There are shy holdouts, like gray wolves or grizzly bears, which might take generations to become users. At Singapore’s Mandai Wildlife Bridge, a total of 70 species—including pangolins, sambar deer, long-tailed macaques, fruit bats, and red jungle fowl (a close relative of the domestic chicken)—have crossed the road. “Ten seconds after they’re open, there’s animals using them,” says Darryl Jones, the author of A Clouded Leopard in the Middle of the Road, which tells the stories of deadly highways and lifesaving crossings from Brisbane, Australia, to Alberta, Canada. “The big new question now is—and this is the valid question—So what? Does that actually make a difference?” It takes less than half an hour by train to get from Amsterdam to the Gooi, a region of historic villages and medieval fortified settlements that’s home to the Dutch TV industry. But this short ride takes you across one of the most intensively engineered landscapes on earth: over railroad girder bridges, across shipping canals, past windmills—both ancient stone structures and today’s tubular steel turbines—and expanses of fields created by the polder-dike system that transformed the country’s natural marshy wetlands into productive farmland. For those interested in learning about the limits of wildlife crossings, the Gooi is a good place to start. The region boasts one of the world’s densest collections of such infrastructure, with four bridges, two major underpasses, and a network of tunnels for badgers, amphibians, and reptiles, all within about 10 minutes’ drive from the quaint local capital of Hilversum. Despite millions of dollars in losses, iBuying’s failure doesn’t signal the end of tech-led disruption, just a fumbled beginning. As van der Grift walks along the deck of one of these bridges, he points out fox droppings, blue herons, and trails where groups of roe deer walk in single file, retracing their footsteps each day. From this point, atop the bridge, the six-lane highway below is invisible, shielded by the raised banks or “berms” on either side. But it can be heard, despite efforts to dampen the noise with the foliage of local beech and spruce. The crossing is studded with ponds, close enough together for toads to comfortably hop their way from one to the next. The Netherlands built its first wildlife bridges to stop deer from becoming roadkill. But in the 1990s, the country began to shift to a more holistic ecological mindset, using bridges to link fragments of protected areas. In 2005 the Dutch parliament made such “defragmentation” a long-term nationwide policy, known as MJPO in Dutch. The program marked a shift to a strategic conservation-driven agenda, one that prioritized helping a broad sweep of species—including reptiles, bats, and butterflies—to move across the human-altered landscape. In modeling carried out for the Dutch transport ministry, van der Grift identified 215 bottlenecks where species struggled to pass, flagging them as places where crossings could make the greatest difference. Today there are 70 wildlife bridges in the country and more than 2,000 other structures, such as badger tunnels, rope bridges between trees, and aquatic underpasses. To understand the real value a bridge has, it is important to step back and see the damage that arrives with each tarmac carriageway, says van der Grift, a gentle giant with a dry sense of humor earned in two decades of trying—with mixed results—to thwart animals’ seemingly insatiable desire to throw themselves under cars. A road forms a barrier, one that animals either can’t or do not want to traverse. “It inhibits animals to cross and to get in contact with each other,” van der Grift says. The effects go far beyond roadkill. If the barrier is significant enough, it can make entire animal populations less viable, prone to inbreeding and decline. Wildlife crossings can reduce this barrier effect, the thinking goes, making the road more permeable for a range of species. But few studies so far have been able to say conclusively whether this is really happening or not, he explains. The devil is in the details. In the case of Ede, for example, there was plenty of amphibian traffic in the toad tunnels. But there were not enough structures—just two tunnels initially, hundreds of meters apart, rather than the 10 or more that scientists had recommended. “Many toads that move along the barrier and want to cross the road to get to the breeding pond—they basically gave up because they didn’t encounter a crossing structure early enough,” says Marcel Huijser, a leading US-based road ecologist and a longtime friend of van der Grift’s. Unexpected impacts and side effects crop up at nearly every crossing. Underpasses—often considered a cheaper alternative—seem to be less popular with many species and are rarely used by butterflies. Many aquatic mammals won’t swim into a tunnel where they can’t see the other end, but they can be convinced to walk through the same tunnel if a narrow ledge is built above the waterline. On one bridge in the Gooi, a big buck unexpectedly took over, exerting a territorial effect outside of rutting seasons. He acts as a gatekeeper, allowing does to cross but shutting off access to most males. At the bridge we are standing on, van der Grift is tracking slow worms, armless and legless reptiles that wobble forward like clumsy snakes. Decades after being split by the road and railways, the populations on the east and west sides of the highway had developed distinct genetic profiles. When the bridge opened in 2016, he hoped to see the two populations start to mix. And indeed, DNA testing suggests they are. “We see now that the genetic patterns of the populations are getting closer to each other,” he says. “So there is exchange.” But the ultimate goal is to ensure self-sustaining, healthy, viable animal populations. And it’s still unclear whether the defragmentation efforts are accomplishing that. Van der Grift says he and colleagues wrote a plan for a nationwide empirical evaluation of the MJPO program around a decade ago, but it was never funded (MJPO has since concluded and been superseded by other defragmentation plans). Such studies are often considered prohibitively expensive. It can require decades of tracking population sizes to sort the signal from the noise, explains Silviu Petrovan, a zoologist at the University of Cambridge. Some animals, like amphibians, naturally have population numbers that vary greatly from year to year, he says, meaning totals can zigzag “due to reasons that have nothing to do with your mediation.” “We are now at the stage where the data is coming in—it’s really coming through.” One animal that seems to have benefited from Dutch defragmentation policies is the badger. In the 1980s there were fewer than 1,200 of them nationwide. Since the country began building under-road “badger pipes,” their numbers have more than tripled. Models by van der Grift’s team strongly indicate that the tunnels have a positive effect on population viability. But no robust scientific study has been carried out to prove it, he says. That would entail decades of population monitoring. The Netherlands is not alone in its limited assessment of the impact of wildlife crossings. “Even when we do enough, we don’t do the research for long enough, funded well enough—including a ‘before’ setting, including control settings—to be able to conclude that we actually reached our objectives,” Petrovan says. Many crossing projects don’t even reach the point of clearly defining the objectives they set out to achieve, he says. Jones strikes a more optimistic tone. “We are now at the stage where the data is coming in—it’s really coming through,” he says. He’s particularly encouraged by the ability to do genetic testing: “We’ve got very profoundly useful and effective ways to assess this stuff.” Historically, in the US, conservation has not been the point of animal crossings. Wildlife bridges have so far been seen almost exclusively as traffic safety tools: two dozen or so overpasses built at hot spots for migrating deer and elk. Threatened smaller species barely register among the diverse victims of the highway. “Amphibians? Reptiles? Please …” says van der Grift, summing up how such concerns are typically laughed away. Most studies of US crossings have tracked their impact on road collisions and insurance claims. There, they excel: “When sited correctly, with appropriate fencing, to the target species, we know what wildlife crossings work well over 90% of the time,” says Nina-Marie Lister, who leads the Ecological Design Lab at Ryerson University in Toronto. “They avoid 90 to 95% of wildlife vehicle collisions. That’s an astonishing number in the world of science.” Clockwise from top left: California’s mountain lions, Kenya’s elephants, Singapore’s pangolins, and the Netherlands’ amphibians are among the focal points of wildlife crossing developments. The reduction in property damage and human injury can be significant. In the mid-2010s, for example, a project on State Highway 9 in Grand County, Colorado, added two wildlife bridges, five large arch underpasses, and 10.4 miles of wildlife fencing at a cost of $10 million. The result was an 89% reduction in roadkill. The Center for Large Landscape Conservation, a nonprofit working on ecological connectivity, projected that the crossings would pay for themselves in approximately 22 years, less than a third of the structures’ planned 75-year life span. But if the goal is simply to stop animals from being hit by cars, there is no need for a bridge. “You simply could put a fence and prevent them from going entirely, and your mortality would drop to zero,” says Petrovan, who conducts research on wildlife crossings for Conservation Evidence, a database of scientific findings about conservation actions. “It helps us feel better, because we see fewer individuals killed. But for the population, it doesn’t actually give any benefits,” he says. Huijser says the US has been less inclined than his native Netherlands—and “almost anywhere else I’ve worked”—to think about conservation as a goal of crossings. But that is changing. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which was signed into law in November and has allocated $350 million for wildlife crossings for the next five years, ​​provides new federal funding for projects and research to reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions as well as connect fragmented areas of habitat. Although that amount is just 0.3% of the bill’s $110 billion budget for roads, road ecologists have hailed it as a landmark investment. There is now a publicly funded way to build crossings that target conservation goals, even though collision reduction remains the primary focus, says Rob Ament, senior conservationist at the Center for Large Landscape Conservation. The dedicated funding also means wildlife crossings are no longer competing with potholes for scarce tax dollars. “I think it’s actually a huge step forward,” Ament says. The bill acknowledges that we need to design infrastructure “with both things in mind: the needs of people—the movement of goods and people—but also the movement of wildlife,” he says. “And finally, we’re doing that.” But what to build? North America’s most influential examples of crossings lie along the Rocky Mountain Front in Canada.

However, a network of this magnitude and robustness doesn’t pop up overnight and enterprises and consumers are just beginning to realize the myriad use cases a 5G network can support. For example, consider the increased number of connected devices in a house like smart thermostats, security cameras, tablets, smartwatches, and mobile phones, of course. Raj Savoor, the vice president of network analytics and automation at AT&T Labs explains, “Currently we estimate the average consumer home footprint has about 13 connected devices, including mobile and other devices.” And although that sounds like a large number, he continues to explain the real scale, “That's going to increase to 30 to 40 devices over the next five years, so a really big increase.” And the real challenge he continues to explain is that, “This growth needs advanced network architectures to support, manage and provide fast, secure, and reliable services.” Bandwidth will also increase five times in the next five years, according to Savoor, as consumers adopt immersive interactive applications. Immersive experiences also require lower latency and jitter, and a lot more security and reliability. For a company like AT&T that supports a large existing network, building the next generation network requires an incremental approach. In fact, AT&T’s 5G network has been years in the making. “We look at it as a journey. There are a lot of steps that we've taken over the past few years to build on it, and we have prepared for the next step,” says Savoor. And as businesses and consumers transition to a 5G world, AT&T keeps looking ahead. “We are thinking about the next 20 and 50 years. Network investments take a long time, and we want to make those investments with economics in mind, but also very much ensuring the most reliable network offering,” says Savoor. TranscriptLaurel Ruma: From MIT Technology Review, I'm Laurel Ruma and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace. Our topic today is architecting networks. From cell tower to device, 5G is helping connect people and spark innovation with a reliable, fast, and scalable network. This means big opportunities for consumers and enterprises. Two words for you: next, next-generation. My guest is Raj Savoor, the vice president of network analytics and automation at AT&T Labs. This podcast is produced in partnership with Infosys Cobalt. Welcome Raj. Raj: Thank you, Laurel. I'm delighted to be here with you today. Laurel: AT&T Labs has a long history of innovation. How is it now building that next generation of networks in a cloud-driven, digital-driven world? Raj: Great question, and it's something we spend a lot of time thinking about. Every technology turn is different. We're certainly leaning into this change to 5G networks and a lot of increased fiber penetration in our networks, leaning back on our culture of innovation, of our history and legacy, and particularly adapting to change as we've gone through so many generational changes. It is a unique period. We are investing both in other 5G wireless network and at the same time expanding our footprint of fiber optics further into the network, closer to our consumers and businesses. We are seeing rapid adoption and unprecedented demand for bandwidth from our both consumer and enterprise customers. Usage for example, in the home, is increasing. It will increase five times over the next five years. We saw some of that during the pandemic. The number of devices in the home are rapidly increasing. Currently, we estimate the average consumer home footprint has about 13 connected devices, including mobile and other devices. That's going to increase to 30 to 40 devices over the next five years, so a really big increase. This growth needs advanced network architectures to support, manage and provide fast, secure, and reliable services. Our approach is evolutionary. That's primarily because we are an existing, very large network that has gone through so many generational changes. When we use the next-generation architecture, we have to be cognizant of the existing infrastructure and work that incrementally, so it's not like a brand-new, greenfield, overlay build. It is that incremental approach, and it's never a single switch. We look at it as a journey. There are a lot of steps that we've taken over the past few years to build on it, and we have prepared for the next step. Laurel: Some of those steps include making that network more stable and reliable and with great coverage to touch all those households, right? Raj: Correct. I think the foundation comes with our connectivity. To make sure coverage and reach of the network, be it the radio frequency coverage or the fiber optics to the edge begins there, but it doesn't stop there. There is a lot of additional elements to managing the reliability as well as attributes of that complete customer experience. We are shifting from just single dimensional views of connectivity to an experiential and secure and how we define reliability in a much broader context. That needs a lot more architectural forethought in how we design and deliver ultimately. Laurel: What will that shift to 5G mean for innovation for consumers and enterprises? Raj: Just to maybe step back, in our past generations of change and mobile talk wireless, in the first few generations it was all about mobility and basic connectivity for voice. Then we went to messaging and early data. Then when we went from 3G to LTE or the full generation, it was about speed. As we look at where we are in terms of where the customers are driving us at 5G, that is all about immersive experiences. This requires lower latencies, which is the actual time it takes for a video to start or a download to begin of your next application, or an interactive session that may be in high definition or in AR or VR mode. It also needs lower jitter, which means lower variability, in that experience. You also need a lot more security and reliability. The security because a personal device is basically an extension of our persona. Many of our lives are entwined in that device. So, privacy information, protection of that device, protection of the data in the device, become equally important over the network channel. Those are the requirements that our customers are demanding and that can really be met in the 5G network architecture. Besides the connectivity capabilities, it is bringing the cloud-native application platforms closer to the edge of the network. It's an architecture that does require a use of a lot more automation and infusion of AI- and ML-driven approaches to provide that customer experience that is needed. At the end of the day, we expect the consumers to be able to consume more of those immersive interactive applications rendered, say, in the cloud. This could be in a venue, it could be in their homes, it could be when they're using a 5G-powered wearable device. It could be in a connected car running in a smart city. When you look at all of these different use cases, there's also a need for seamless transitions from 5G to WiFi, and so on. That is part of the overall network design and thinking that goes into our perspective. Again, security is also paramount. We constantly hear from our customers how important that is, and that is a cornerstone of how we are approaching it. AI- and ML-based approaches allow us to provide these threat analytics and security for that experience. Laurel: Yeah, that's a really good point. The network is now much bigger than it ever was. It reaches to the edge, which is every single device that uses a connection, pretty much. When you are on your cell phone at a football or soccer game, you expect to be able to look up scores or watch the latest play. You also tend to expect that real-time access to that information, to those video streams, to the data. That is one example, but we're also talking about industrial uses as well. My favorite is reaching out to oil platforms or planes or ships. The edge could be so many different nodes that we actually have to broaden our definition of what network means, correct? Raj: Absolutely. We certainly see the adoption of 5G and the edge technologies beginning at the enterprise. I think the enterprise and industrial adoption then is driving it for the consumer. Different generations of technologies have either begun at the consumer or at the enterprise level. Because of the adoption of edge cloud capabilities, what we refer to as multi-access edge compute, 5G is effectively bringing cloud compute, storage, and analytics capabilities and applications closer to those industrial applications. This is an area that we've really focused on for multiple years. AT&T has a 5G innovation studio where we bring in our enterprise customers and their problem statements and use cases. We bring in startups and other partners to put together solutions to address those blind spots or problem statements in connectivity and applications. Those frequently make use of industrial internet of things. It's where automation and industrial robots need hyper precision on location, and the network actually enables that. Also, there's a lot of video analytics to do assessment of safety issues within locations. The video analytics can be run very, very close to the industrial application and provide that real-time feedback we talked about in the consumer space. It allows quality of service and speed and low latency of 5G as well as security compared to unlicensed spectrum and other network technologies as an enabler for those industrial use cases. Drones are another emerging area. There's a need for autonomous control with low latency. Again, the network is an enabler natively for that. Yeah, we do see adoption across various verticals: healthcare, transportation, manufacturing, smart cities—a lot of sensor, network-driven opportunities. Laurel: One of those examples is FirstNet, a way for first responders to connect during an emergency where other lines of communications may be down. Raj: Yes, it's an area we are very proud to support and be the network for our first responders. There's a FirstNet authority that manages this network. It's a nationwide dedicated platform purposefully built for the first responders and really the extended public safety community that includes our healthcare system. The mission is fairly unique, as you can imagine, relative to consumers or enterprises that have their needs. We were able to bring all those requirements into a common platform. It does have an element that is different where, from a mission-critical perspective, there is no higher priority than the public safety mission. The first authority kind of enables this by enabling specific devices that are customized for the FirstNet experience, as well as applications. It actually has an application developer program as well. One part of the mission that we are highly focused on is the resiliency of that network and the network resources needed not just on any normal day, but when you have that disaster impacting a lot of the infrastructure. In those cases, we have extended our network to take advantage of other resources. We have cell towers on light trucks that are mobile that are placed and then integrate seamlessly with the network. There's also some early work with drones to provide coverage. We're not just looking at tactically, we look at it strategically. Laurel: Part of this need for first responder innovation is because of the changes of climate and the pressures with environmental challenges that are being seen, not just here in North America, but around the world. Raj: Yeah, our network resiliency is one of those implicit goals for our network design and particularly for the public safety mission. We've been looking at a lot of historical data, natural disasters and the impacts, but also modeling for future and modeling in the future risks driven by climate change, where you can have events with a high wind, three-foot floods or higher. And what does that mean for the network? Where should we design and make design changes? Where would we build the next generation of cell towers? And how do you ensure an overall resiliency under those conditions? So that is an important part of the mission and we're thinking about network design and architectures. It is really not even for the next three years. We are thinking about the next 20 and 50 years. Network investments take a long time, and we want to make those investments with economics in mind, but also very much ensuring the most reliable network offering. Laurel: You mentioned artificial intelligence and machine learning in a previous answer. What are some ways that AT&T is using AI and ML, or thinking about deploying artificial intelligence? Raj: Great question and also a very timely one. As a company, we have had researchers working on AI for many years. With the advent of a lot more compute power and a lot more finer grain data, the opportunity has really opened up with the last, I would say, five years. It does play a very significant role at AT&T. Again, we have approached AI in an evolutionary way on how we infuse it. First, we think about AI as the engine, and the fuel is the data. It begins with how we want to collect data and learn from it. That's where a lot of the machine learning capabilities come in. We have been investing in a lot of big data management capabilities over the past few years, ensuring that those are well exposed to our AI engines. Our chief data officer in particular has worked very hard to establish a democratized ecosystem for both the data and AI capability. There's a step function here in complexity as the amount of data increases, particularly with 5G, and we get kind of finer grain visibility, and we have a lot more intelligent controls to then apply decisions. So, we're taking those steps in that evolutionary way. Internally we have many use cases, including how we can use AI for planning, functions, AI for design decisions, but also in real time to help our customers, as well as the network, under various scenarios to provide better efficiency, better customer experiences, detect security threats, the threat analytics, as well as how to use feedback loops to constantly optimize the network. So, a lot of use cases across the life cycle. Laurel: I'm speaking of that focus on security, which is top of mind for most executives these days. But not only security, AI and automation also are playing that really important role for 5G functionality.  What other ways is that coming into play right now with the capabilities of 5G? Raj: Again, this is very timely and a very active work area. Let me give you some context on how we are structured. In thinking about 5G, we think about it as day zero, day one, day two. Day zero is the planning activities and forecasting. I can see some natural ways where AI and machine learning can help you through your forecasting. There's your day one, which is actually building and designing your network. You want to do the greatest efficiency. Again, the feedback loops and reinforce learning kind of helps you do that as well as use of deep learning technology to analyze maps and geospatial data, to determine where you want to have buried fiber optics and where you want to place a small cell versus a macro cell. So, there's a lot of the building engineering where we rely heavily on AI, deep learning, and neural networks. Then there's a lifecycle, which we call day two. In that, there are opportunities, things like energy savings where we are trying to optimize the energy footprint of our equipment. Again, both a corporate priority, but also a societal priority on the carbon footprint. We see great opportunities for economics but also helping the planet. From a 5G technology perspective itself, there is an opportunity in what we refer to as beamforming. Beamforming is basically optimizing how the actual coverage for consumers is improved to mitigate some of the impacts of fading and path loss. The context-aware beamforming along with what we call MIMO [multiple-input and multiple-output], which is a very efficient way of transmission, requires us to understand where the demand is to determine where the customers who are consuming or using our service are located. We want to be hyper precise in that geolocation to optimize that beamforming. Is the consumer stationary? Is the consumer moving? Is he walking at three miles an hour or riding in a connected car? So that information to guide beamforming is a natural native 5G AI opportunity. Laurel: That is certainly part of this complex web that companies need to really start thinking about. So, there's an architectural challenge there to bring together cloud computing, edge computing, 5G, and then a focus on customer experience. As much as you have customers, you're also quite concerned about your customers’ customers and how they're experiencing these products. Raj: Yes. While we have a direct relationship with consumers, in many cases, it is a B2B2C where we have a relationship with a connected car company, and then they'll have relationship with the consumer. Or we would have the relationship with the transportation infrastructure provider, and they would have the relationship with similar other verticals. So that is inherently one of the opportunities that we are able to drive from this architecture. One of those capabilities is what we refer to as network APIs. We derive intelligence from our network and then make it available by APIs from that cloud infrastructure to an application platform for them to further optimize for their unique applications and their consumers. It's an emerging area, and it does require standardization. There's going to be many steps that we've got to mature this. We are pretty excited, and the early results tell us that the overall ecosystem is very hungry for the type of analytics and data to optimize those end user experiences. Laurel: The cloud has played such a pivotal role for numerous industries to build that kind of resiliency that we've been threading through this conversation, but then also drive innovation. When you think about, and you mentioned not just the next three to five years, for the next 30 to 50 years, in a smaller scope, what technological advancements excite you the most? What's on that horizon? Raj: First I think we've benefited from a few of the industry, I'll call them, laws. Certainly, Moore's Law, that we all enjoy increased computing power at lower costs, effectively where we are with growth in storage and cloud capabilities. Then there's the other part, which is the demand part—the consumer appetite for increased consumption. Some of it is behavioral. Some of it is autonomous as they adopt devices with higher resolution. Effectively that drives the consumption both downlink and uplink. Trends that I'm following and I'm expecting to be the drivers for the future is first, like I mentioned earlier, we are expecting usage to increase five-fold in five years. While I don't have a crystal ball quite beyond the next five years, I don't see any reason why that wouldn't continue, particularly bi-directional communication, especially with those immersive VR/AR [virtual reality/augmented reality] experiences. The number of connected devices and devices just around us, whether it's variables in our automobile, in our home, is going to double or triple. We expect that trend to also drive effectively the quality of our lives and really operating in every phase of our day. I see sensors increasing, and I think not just in the home, but also in smart cities and in the public domain. And a seamless opportunity between our home, work, transportation, and places that we visit. So it's going to be increasingly driving that seamless experiences that I'm excited about. It is going to be an exciting future. Laurel: It sure is. Thank you so much, Raj, for joining us on the Business Lab. Raj: Thank you, Laurel.

One part of the mission that we are highly focused on is the resiliency of that network and the network resources needed not just on any normal day, but when you have that disaster impacting a lot of the infrastructure. In those cases, we have extended our network to take advantage of other resources. We have cell towers on light trucks that are mobile that are placed and then integrate seamlessly with the network. There's also some early work with drones to provide coverage. We're not just looking at tactically, we look at it strategically. Laurel: Part of this need for first responder innovation is because of the changes of climate and the pressures with environmental challenges that are being seen, not just here in North America, but around the world. Raj: Yeah, our network resiliency is one of those implicit goals for our network design and particularly for the public safety mission. We've been looking at a lot of historical data, natural disasters and the impacts, but also modeling for future and modeling in the future risks driven by climate change, where you can have events with a high wind, three-foot floods or higher. And what does that mean for the network? Where should we design and make design changes? Where would we build the next generation of cell towers? And how do you ensure an overall resiliency under those conditions? So that is an important part of the mission and we're thinking about network design and architectures. It is really not even for the next three years. We are thinking about the next 20 and 50 years. Network investments take a long time, and we want to make those investments with economics in mind, but also very much ensuring the most reliable network offering. Laurel: You mentioned artificial intelligence and machine learning in a previous answer. What are some ways that AT&T is using AI and ML, or thinking about deploying artificial intelligence? Raj: Great question and also a very timely one. As a company, we have had researchers working on AI for many years. With the advent of a lot more compute power and a lot more finer grain data, the opportunity has really opened up with the last, I would say, five years. It does play a very significant role at AT&T. Again, we have approached AI in an evolutionary way on how we infuse it. First, we think about AI as the engine, and the fuel is the data. It begins with how we want to collect data and learn from it. That's where a lot of the machine learning capabilities come in. We have been investing in a lot of big data management capabilities over the past few years, ensuring that those are well exposed to our AI engines. Our chief data officer in particular has worked very hard to establish a democratized ecosystem for both the data and AI capability. There's a step function here in complexity as the amount of data increases, particularly with 5G, and we get kind of finer grain visibility, and we have a lot more intelligent controls to then apply decisions. So, we're taking those steps in that evolutionary way. Internally we have many use cases, including how we can use AI for planning, functions, AI for design decisions, but also in real time to help our customers, as well as the network, under various scenarios to provide better efficiency, better customer experiences, detect security threats, the threat analytics, as well as how to use feedback loops to constantly optimize the network. So, a lot of use cases across the life cycle. Laurel: I'm speaking of that focus on security, which is top of mind for most executives these days. But not only security, AI and automation also are playing that really important role for 5G functionality. What other ways is that coming into play right now with the capabilities of 5G? Raj: Again, this is very timely and a very active work area. Let me give you some context on how we are structured. In thinking about 5G, we think about it as day zero, day one, day two. Day zero is the planning activities and forecasting. I can see some natural ways where AI and machine learning can help you through your forecasting. There's your day one, which is actually building and designing your network. You want to do the greatest efficiency. Again, the feedback loops and reinforce learning kind of helps you do that as well as use of deep learning technology to analyze maps and geospatial data, to determine where you want to have buried fiber optics and where you want to place a small cell versus a macro cell. So, there's a lot of the building engineering where we rely heavily on AI, deep learning, and neural networks. Then there's a lifecycle, which we call day two. In that, there are opportunities, things like energy savings where we are trying to optimize the energy footprint of our equipment. Again, both a corporate priority, but also a societal priority on the carbon footprint. We see great opportunities for economics but also helping the planet. From a 5G technology perspective itself, there is an opportunity in what we refer to as beamforming. Beamforming is basically optimizing how the actual coverage for consumers is improved to mitigate some of the impacts of fading and path loss. The context-aware beamforming along with what we call MIMO [multiple-input and multiple-output], which is a very efficient way of transmission, requires us to understand where the demand is to determine where the customers who are consuming or using our service are located. We want to be hyper precise in that geolocation to optimize that beamforming. Is the consumer stationary? Is the consumer moving? Is he walking at three miles an hour or riding in a connected car? So that information to guide beamforming is a natural native 5G AI opportunity. Laurel: That is certainly part of this complex web that companies need to really start thinking about. So, there's an architectural challenge there to bring together cloud computing, edge computing, 5G, and then a focus on customer experience. As much as you have customers, you're also quite concerned about your customers’ customers and how they're experiencing these products. Raj: Yes. While we have a direct relationship with consumers, in many cases, it is a B2B2C where we have a relationship with a connected car company, and then they'll have relationship with the consumer. Or we would have the relationship with the transportation infrastructure provider, and they would have the relationship with similar other verticals. So that is inherently one of the opportunities that we are able to drive from this architecture. One of those capabilities is what we refer to as network APIs. We derive intelligence from our network and then make it available by APIs from that cloud infrastructure to an application platform for them to further optimize for their unique applications and their consumers. It's an emerging area, and it does require standardization. There's going to be many steps that we've got to mature this. We are pretty excited, and the early results tell us that the overall ecosystem is very hungry for the type of analytics and data to optimize those end user experiences. Laurel: The cloud has played such a pivotal role for numerous industries to build that kind of resiliency that we've been threading through this conversation, but then also drive innovation. When you think about, and you mentioned not just the next three to five years, for the next 30 to 50 years, in a smaller scope, what technological advancements excite you the most? What's on that horizon? Raj: First I think we've benefited from a few of the industry, I'll call them, laws. Certainly, Moore's Law, that we all enjoy increased computing power at lower costs, effectively where we are with growth in storage and cloud capabilities. Then there's the other part, which is the demand part—the consumer appetite for increased consumption. Some of it is behavioral. Some of it is autonomous as they adopt devices with higher resolution. Effectively that drives the consumption both downlink and uplink. Trends that I'm following and I'm expecting to be the drivers for the future is first, like I mentioned earlier, we are expecting usage to increase five-fold in five years. While I don't have a crystal ball quite beyond the next five years, I don't see any reason why that wouldn't continue, particularly bi-directional communication, especially with those immersive VR/AR [virtual reality/augmented reality] experiences. The number of connected devices and devices just around us, whether it's variables in our automobile, in our home, is going to double or triple. We expect that trend to also drive effectively the quality of our lives and really operating in every phase of our day. I see sensors increasing, and I think not just in the home, but also in smart cities and in the public domain. And a seamless opportunity between our home, work, transportation, and places that we visit. So it's going to be increasingly driving that seamless experiences that I'm excited about. It is going to be an exciting future. Laurel: It sure is. Thank you so much, Raj, for joining us on the Business Lab. Raj: Thank you, Laurel.

To address the skills gap, some companies are prioritizing upskilling and reskilling. But to be effective, learning and development itself must undergo a transformation. According to Daniela Proust, global vice president and head of global people enablement and growth at Siemens, learning and development is at the core of digital transformation. “In light of a major transformation that businesses are facing, either by new business models arising or new innovation and technologies driving a certain business area forward, you see that you need to accompany that structural change, that structural workforce transformation in order to drive business transformation,” she says. Traditional training methods need to also transform. Given the speed of technological change and need for business agility, multi-day offsite training (some of which may not even apply to the employee’s role) is no longer viable. Fortunately, the same technologies that are driving digital transformation in other areas of the business can also be leveraged to transform learning and development. “Now people learn more often, for shorter periods of time, but training is much more tailored to what they need in that moment, and that is enabled by technology,” explains Proust. In addition to delivering just-in-time training, a modern learning and development platform can provide valuable insights. “A platform-based learning ecosystem with a learning experience platform at the core enables you to gain insights that we never had in the past.” says Proust. This new approach to learning delivers benefits to both the business and its employees as they acquire the skills that help accelerate the company’s digital transformation and fuel their own career growth. This episode of Business Lab is produced in association with Infosys Cobalt. Laurel Ruma: From MIT Technology Review, I'm Laurel Ruma, and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace. Our topic today is learning and development. In every industry, businesses are eager to leverage technological advancements to bring innovations to the marketplace. Thanks to cloud computing, a lot of those technologies are within reach. The problem, however, is finding and retaining the people who know how to use them. Two words for you, upskilling, reskilling. My guest today is Daniela Proust, who is the global vice president and head of global people enablement and growth at Siemens. This podcast is produced in partnership with Infosys Cobalt. Welcome, Daniela. Daniela: Hi, Laurel. Laurel: According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report, upskilling and reskilling were the top priorities for 59% of learning and development professionals in 2021. Do you think that this is a trend we can expect moving forward? Daniela: Absolutely, yes. And to be honest with you, when I read this World Economic Forum’s report, I was surprised that it was only 59% of L&D professionals putting it as a top priority, because I was thinking it should be at least a hundred percent. But it may be because all the topics that were number two, three, and four, also had to do with how we can create an environment where people can learn and grow. Laurel: And some of that is predicated on the fact that learning is traditionally a back-office role, right? But you need executive buy-in to give their support to build out learning and development programs. Another interesting data point is the Workplace Learning Report in 2020 said only 27% of learning and development professionals felt their CEOs were active champions of learning. But then in 2021, we know what happened, right? Sixty-two percent are now champions of learning. So that's a massive jump in just one year. What is it that these CEOs are beginning to understand? What are they learning that we just may not know yet? Daniela: If you ask me, I think it finally gets on stage where it should be. So, it's spot on. And I'm very happy to see these statistics out there. When I reflect on the journey within Siemens, I also see over the years that learning has evolved from one important topic of HR to become a core topic of HR, to then become a core topic and be part of the overall business strategy. So, it has moved a lot in the sense of how important it is and also how much attention is given to the topic by executive leadership. Laurel: Being a champion to employees when it comes to learning and development is so important from executives, but what does it take to get to the point where learning drives business transformation? Daniela: I think it's a very important question, and that is one that keeps me up at night. I think that learning is absolutely driving business transformation. Why? Because we see that change is everywhere at a pace that we had never imagined. We simply don't know what the next jobs are to come tomorrow, in five years, 10 years. In order to be successful and drive successful business, you need to continuously adapt the roles that you have to drive your successful business. Right? And I see that in the talent acquisition space. I see that almost every job posting now is a new one. So if that holds true, we have new jobs, new skills, new competencies all the time. And therefore, we all need to continuously learn and grow. And only then can the business be successful. In light of a major transformation that businesses are facing, either by new business models arising or new innovation and technologies driving a certain business area forward, you see that you need to accompany that structural change, that structural workforce transformation in order to drive business transformation. So for me, it's at the core of it. Laurel: There's certainly many challenges when we're talking about digital learning and business transformation. And the covid-19 pandemic certainly had a significant effect on how and where people work. But it also caused employees, everybody to reevaluate that work life balance and their career goals. In turn, what kind of effect has all of this had on learning and the enterprise? And why is now a critical time for enterprises to look at their learning programs? Daniela: Yeah, I think the covid pandemic has accelerated a transformation that was already happening. I would say we had major drivers for change with regards to digital transformation on the whole that were already radically and disruptively changing the overall approach of learning or to learning to platform-based ecosystems, thinking in experiences and not just traditional courses that are delivered in a classroom environment. Technology is really enabling us to provide completely new personalized learning experiences at scale to our people. When the pandemic started, I was so happy that we were ready to then completely transform the way we bring learning to our learners in rapid time. To bring personalized learning experiences to our people that they can pick and choose what they want to learn at the moment of need integrated in the flow of work. I mean, these are words that sound easy, but it is a massive shift. We did a survey three, four years ago about what people were thinking about learning. Siemens as a technology company has always valued competence and expertise very, very much. But also we had a quite traditional approach to learning. We had a number of classroom trainings. And it was almost like an incentive that at the end of a year, you would discuss with your manager what has worked well in the course of the year, and then get a training course to help you continue on your journey. Now people learn more often, for shorter periods of time, but training is much more tailored to what they need in that moment, and that is enabled by technology. The pandemic made that happen so that people, I would say were even forced to try it out. These experiences that were created and delivered to them, they could try them out and see, ""Oh, actually it doesn't hurt. Oh, actually it's helping me. I should really engage in this."" And it was a turbo booster of cultural adjustment. It was a turbo booster of taking more ownership to be curious and find out what is relevant for you and then embarking on that journey yourself, but also in teams or with your manager. I think on the whole it has indeed significantly shifted in a very short period of time, in two years. And when you ask about how is that also causing an impact on the overall work environment, one thing is the overall topic of learning and development. Certainly, major shift is happening there. We also hear from our people that they are much more conscious. How do I want to work? What kind of environment do I want? How often do I actually really have to go to the office? Maybe twice per week is enough and everything else I can do in virtual settings and still be connected even at scale across the globe. So, I think this is probably the best outcome out of a difficult time that we completely reevaluate how we want to work and how we want to learn and grow. Laurel: That's a great way to kind of frame what traditional learning was. You'd gather in a classroom, perhaps you'd fly to a different city. You'd meet with colleagues, and you'd all take days-long learning classes, perhaps, away from work away from everything else. But now, as you say, with technology and with the ability to work where you are and learn where you are, that learning has kind of moved, not just from in-person, but to online and where you are in the flow of work. I think that particular idea is very unique and new to development and learning. Correct? Daniela: Absolutely. What I find so interesting is these concepts that we saw come out of industrialization in certain industries, and then all of a sudden you had, according to Porter, different strategies that you could pick. You would either be a mass provider of commodities, or you would differentiate through certain things that you can tailor and customize and therefore get a prime for it. And then, all of a sudden, these things like mass customization were starting. If you think of how jeans were then produced: you could order online, according to your complete body shape, and it would nonetheless be produced in the same factory environment. For me, that is kind of the same thing that is happening here: we have a huge array of learning opportunities, and we can tailor them through algorithms and matching mechanisms to the individual. It is really about personalized learning experience at scale. And for me, that is totally fascinating. Laurel: I also like that choosing of words very carefully, which is continuous learning, right? Learning isn't just something you do at a certain time and place. We are always continually learning new skills, new ideas, new ways of working. And to seamlessly integrate that into your work life certainly helps. But how, after two years of working from home battling digital fatigue, how do we make learning online interesting and exciting when it is being delivered via the technology? Daniela: That is a very good question and super important. At the end of the day, it's all about relevance so that you get the relevant learning opportunities to the learner at the moment of need. And that also the experience is really great for the individual. Sounds easy, it's really not so easy to do because everybody learns in a different way. You might enjoy podcasts most, somebody else likes videos or more hybrid interactions or a complete learning path. And you have the whole array at your fingertips so you can pick and choose what makes most sense for you, and I think that is what makes it so powerful. At the same time, I fully agree that we ramped up the technology and completely new experiences in rapid time. And people indeed are getting tired of being in front of the screen now so long every day with many, many more meetings. I don't know if you have read this. There’s a study. I think it was a 250% increase in the number of meetings in just one year. This is just craziness. And I must say, I can mirror it for myself. I feel that too. So, when you think about digital fatigue, that it is happening just because everything becomes so digital and virtual, what we are competing for is our people’s time. That becomes the most important factor and denominator. Therefore, for people to prioritize this kind of learning experience, it has to be a really good experience and has to help them and be relevant to them. So that is the success. It sounds easy, as I said, it is not so much. But that is where the technology comes into play. So yes, technology is revolutionizing learning, and the experience is really at the core of it. You have concepts like gamification that allow you to bring social components into the platform, put challenges out, have some rewards and recognition mechanisms, and all of that bundled together makes a great experience for the people. Laurel: What are the other benefits of a modern learning program? I've seen some companies do things like, as you mentioned, engineering challenges. Even hackathons could be considered a way to learn in a different way. Because everyone does, as you mentioned, learn in different ways. Do you feel that companies are looking at this way of distributed learning and continuous learning as a way to bring that change even to the way that we think of learning? Daniela: Absolutely. It's a total driver for innovation and it is also a driver to create something like a company memory of expertise and knowledge. Because you can bring together through one single point of entry, a universe of learning opportunities to the people. You have so many great people and organizations that can contribute with latest insights, topics that they want to position and bring to the people. We haven't had that in the past. Imagine a company like Siemens, a huge technology company active in so many industries. It means that we need to bring together learning opportunities from, let's say, a functional perspective. So, if you are in finance or in supply chain, we need to then also complete it by, we call it cross-functional learning opportunities, which are topics that are relevant for everybody like languages or communication. We also have a whole learning landscape available on technology topics, on product-specific topics, on market-specific topics. It’s a huge landscape of learning opportunities, and everybody needs a subset, and everybody needs a very individual specialized subset. That is a huge benefit to be able to tailor it to that. And by having such an approach, I must also say it's much more efficient and productive because it saves time and money. People can have access to a whole universe. They don't have to travel, don't have to then encounter programs where maybe only a certain percentage of it is relevant to them. It's really helpful also to drive the overall business success. Laurel: And part of that business success is digital transformation, right? Adopting and rolling out new technologies like automation and artificial intelligence. This will create a new division of labor between humans and machines, which will disrupt jobs globally. But as these jobs evolve, new roles will be created with people having specific advantages over machines and AI like managing and decision making and communicating and interacting — all of those things that humans are really good at. How can business people prepare and prepare their employees for this shift from automation? Daniela: Yeah, I think it is something that accompanied us already since quite a few years. But there, again, the speed and also the level of skills needed has increased so significantly. I would say it's almost like a bouquet of things that you can do and should do. You need to, as a company, create an identity and first of all, say that you really think learning and individual growth is super important. It is a priority for the company, and you need to give it a positive spin. It is there for you, it is there to support you, it starts with you. That is why we have initiated a company-wide campaign that we call MyGrowth. It's much more than a campaign, it's an overall concept and approach. But it is really meant to inspire and engage people to try out the different experiences that we provide and help them to navigate and give orientation what they should and can use. Then we have also initiated a target on learning hours because we really wanted to nudge people and say, ""Look, it's important that you take the time and that you take it as a priority."" With regard to the specific skills that you were mentioning around automation and digitalization, we then can include specific strategic topics that we push to our people. We drive awareness campaigns through learning opportunities. Those can be targeted for certain audiences because people also need different skill levels. Or we can push it at scale. This is a highly flexible system. If I may give you an example, we have one pocket in our businesses that is called Digital Industries Software. It fits very nicely to what you were mentioning. The CEO of that business last year said we are in a software business, so AI is a major driver for everything that we are doing. Therefore, my whole organization needs to understand what first of all, artificial intelligence is, let's say on a very generic level. But also, people need to understand how we are using it as a technology internally, but also as a driver for our business and software solutions. And then we created different learning paths for different expertise layers, and could therefore, bring the whole topic in a very comprehensive manner to thousands of people of our Digital Industries business. Laurel: So, you are doing two things. One, you're pushing out what you think that everyone needs to know and learn, artificial intelligence being a big topic. But then how do you then also do assessments of people and their skills to identify skill gaps and then align learning programs with the business strategy to basically not just get a return on investment? Of course, everything does come back to profit, but also return on investment on the employee's time and expertise. Because that is also something you're growing. Daniela: Yes. And the skills topic is a very hot one, I can tell you. It's all over the place and coming from very different lenses and use cases. Technology plays a major role. A platform-based learning ecosystem with a learning experience platform at the core enables you to gain insights that we never had in the past. We can see what interests people. We can see why and for what are they engaging in learning, what are they then actually learning or what are they not learning, and then therefore, leaving. If you then multiply that and you see that over the overall workforce, you see also what are hot topics, what are skills that are coming on the horizon. You can see that in certain communities. We have certain communities that are, for instance, we call them digital talents, like tech talents. And there, you already see what the next topics are that will come on the horizon. And then we can match as a learning function, do we already have the right learning opportunities for the topics that are being searched for? That is one thing. But that is more the bottom-up part of it that is super important. From a top-down perspective, we also have a very strategic approach to that, which we call NextWork where we see areas of major workforce transformation, and usually the levers are either disruptive new business models or/and technology that is driving change. And there, we do targeted workforce transformation analysis. We take a look at, okay, what are the jobs in that area today, where do we see those roles evolving? Potentially some of them being completely eliminated or completely new ones arising that we hadn't even known. Then we match that with our workforce and see how we can accompany our people from A to B. But there, you then need to go from a, let's say, conceptual level of the analysis that you do in the first step to then apply it to the individual to make it meaningful, and then match the relevant learning interventions and development path for the individual. And for that, assessments play a key role. In our learning platform that we call My Learning World, we have a functionality that we call My Skills. If, for instance, a manager says we have significant things happening in this area, you are becoming a software developer, then you can assign a role to that person and say, ""Look, why don't you check out whether this role is the next right approach for you.” And then you get a skill assessment where you can see the major needed capabilities, skills, and competencies for that role. Then you can self-rate yourself also in alignment with your manager and get very targeted learning interventions mapped. So it gives the individual a very good orientation where to start and where to focus. Laurel: What do you see as the future of learning and development? What excites you the most? Daniela: I'm really passionate about people. I think the whole topic is super exciting. And I think technology is such an opportunity to radically shift the world of learning and development. And it already is. For me, learning is simply never complete. We all have to continuously learn, to unlearn, and also to relearn. I think the more we bring this awareness across that people are aware that they are in the driver's seat of their own employability, that is really, really important. And it excites me. And I think there, you have to work with concepts like curiosity, work with people and inspire them, ignite a passion for learning. Because usually, people are by nature very curious. Laurel: At some point we'll have to talk more about what unlearning means, because that is certainly an interesting idea. We kind of go through life learning very specific things, and it is partly correcting the way we think about ideas and methods that perhaps are not the best way of learning it. But then also, it's a bit of a way to retrain the brain, isn't it? There’re better ways of doing math now than there were 20, 30 years ago. Daniela: It is. I think this topic of unlearning, people sometimes think it sounds a bit paradox, but it comes from the fact that when you have learned something, it is really ingrained in your brain and you start with the hypotheses of how you see the world and how you see things, how they should be. Right? Therefore, you will always start with that frame of reference. But if then the frame of reference would need to be changed just because the outside world is shifting so much, it means you have to almost delete what your first reaction would be and start completely fresh and be open to a new approach. And that is one that we all have to learn and do more probably. Laurel: Absolutely. Thank you very much, Daniela, for what has been a fantastic episode of the Business Lab.

To address the skills gap, some companies are prioritizing upskilling and reskilling. But to be effective, learning and development itself must undergo a transformation. According to Daniela Proust, global vice president and head of global people enablement and growth at Siemens, learning and development is at the core of digital transformation. “In light of a major transformation that businesses are facing, either by new business models arising or new innovation and technologies driving a certain business area forward, you see that you need to accompany that structural change, that structural workforce transformation in order to drive business transformation,” she says. Traditional training methods need to also transform. Given the speed of technological change and need for business agility, multi-day offsite training (some of which may not even apply to the employee’s role) is no longer viable. Fortunately, the same technologies that are driving digital transformation in other areas of the business can also be leveraged to transform learning and development. “Now people learn more often, for shorter periods of time, but training is much more tailored to what they need in that moment, and that is enabled by technology,” explains Proust. In addition to delivering just-in-time training, a modern learning and development platform can provide valuable insights. “A platform-based learning ecosystem with a learning experience platform at the core enables you to gain insights that we never had in the past.” says Proust. This new approach to learning delivers benefits to both the business and its employees as they acquire the skills that help accelerate the company’s digital transformation and fuel their own career growth.

Laurel: And part of that business success is digital transformation, right? Adopting and rolling out new technologies like automation and artificial intelligence. This will create a new division of labor between humans and machines, which will disrupt jobs globally. But as these jobs evolve, new roles will be created with people having specific advantages over machines and AI like managing and decision making and communicating and interacting — all of those things that humans are really good at. How can business people prepare and prepare their employees for this shift from automation? Daniela: Yeah, I think it is something that accompanied us already since quite a few years. But there, again, the speed and also the level of skills needed has increased so significantly. I would say it's almost like a bouquet of things that you can do and should do. You need to, as a company, create an identity and first of all, say that you really think learning and individual growth is super important. It is a priority for the company, and you need to give it a positive spin. It is there for you, it is there to support you, it starts with you. That is why we have initiated a company-wide campaign that we call MyGrowth. It's much more than a campaign, it's an overall concept and approach. But it is really meant to inspire and engage people to try out the different experiences that we provide and help them to navigate and give orientation what they should and can use. Then we have also initiated a target on learning hours because we really wanted to nudge people and say, ""Look, it's important that you take the time and that you take it as a priority."" With regard to the specific skills that you were mentioning around automation and digitalization, we then can include specific strategic topics that we push to our people. We drive awareness campaigns through learning opportunities. Those can be targeted for certain audiences because people also need different skill levels. Or we can push it at scale. This is a highly flexible system. If I may give you an example, we have one pocket in our businesses that is called Digital Industries Software. It fits very nicely to what you were mentioning. The CEO of that business last year said we are in a software business, so AI is a major driver for everything that we are doing. Therefore, my whole organization needs to understand what first of all, artificial intelligence is, let's say on a very generic level. But also, people need to understand how we are using it as a technology internally, but also as a driver for our business and software solutions. And then we created different learning paths for different expertise layers, and could therefore, bring the whole topic in a very comprehensive manner to thousands of people of our Digital Industries business. Laurel: So, you are doing two things. One, you're pushing out what you think that everyone needs to know and learn, artificial intelligence being a big topic. But then how do you then also do assessments of people and their skills to identify skill gaps and then align learning programs with the business strategy to basically not just get a return on investment? Of course, everything does come back to profit, but also return on investment on the employee's time and expertise. Because that is also something you're growing. Daniela: Yes. And the skills topic is a very hot one, I can tell you. It's all over the place and coming from very different lenses and use cases. Technology plays a major role. A platform-based learning ecosystem with a learning experience platform at the core enables you to gain insights that we never had in the past. We can see what interests people. We can see why and for what are they engaging in learning, what are they then actually learning or what are they not learning, and then therefore, leaving. If you then multiply that and you see that over the overall workforce, you see also what are hot topics, what are skills that are coming on the horizon. You can see that in certain communities. We have certain communities that are, for instance, we call them digital talents, like tech talents. And there, you already see what the next topics are that will come on the horizon. And then we can match as a learning function, do we already have the right learning opportunities for the topics that are being searched for? That is one thing. But that is more the bottom-up part of it that is super important. From a top-down perspective, we also have a very strategic approach to that, which we call NextWork where we see areas of major workforce transformation, and usually the levers are either disruptive new business models or/and technology that is driving change. And there, we do targeted workforce transformation analysis. We take a look at, okay, what are the jobs in that area today, where do we see those roles evolving? Potentially some of them being completely eliminated or completely new ones arising that we hadn't even known. Then we match that with our workforce and see how we can accompany our people from A to B. But there, you then need to go from a, let's say, conceptual level of the analysis that you do in the first step to then apply it to the individual to make it meaningful, and then match the relevant learning interventions and development path for the individual. And for that, assessments play a key role. In our learning platform that we call My Learning World, we have a functionality that we call My Skills. If, for instance, a manager says we have significant things happening in this area, you are becoming a software developer, then you can assign a role to that person and say, ""Look, why don't you check out whether this role is the next right approach for you.” And then you get a skill assessment where you can see the major needed capabilities, skills, and competencies for that role. Then you can self-rate yourself also in alignment with your manager and get very targeted learning interventions mapped. So it gives the individual a very good orientation where to start and where to focus. Laurel: What do you see as the future of learning and development? What excites you the most? Daniela: I'm really passionate about people. I think the whole topic is super exciting. And I think technology is such an opportunity to radically shift the world of learning and development. And it already is. For me, learning is simply never complete. We all have to continuously learn, to unlearn, and also to relearn. I think the more we bring this awareness across that people are aware that they are in the driver's seat of their own employability, that is really, really important. And it excites me. And I think there, you have to work with concepts like curiosity, work with people and inspire them, ignite a passion for learning. Because usually, people are by nature very curious. Laurel: At some point we'll have to talk more about what unlearning means, because that is certainly an interesting idea. We kind of go through life learning very specific things, and it is partly correcting the way we think about ideas and methods that perhaps are not the best way of learning it. But then also, it's a bit of a way to retrain the brain, isn't it? There’re better ways of doing math now than there were 20, 30 years ago. Daniela: It is. I think this topic of unlearning, people sometimes think it sounds a bit paradox, but it comes from the fact that when you have learned something, it is really ingrained in your brain and you start with the hypotheses of how you see the world and how you see things, how they should be. Right? Therefore, you will always start with that frame of reference. But if then the frame of reference would need to be changed just because the outside world is shifting so much, it means you have to almost delete what your first reaction would be and start completely fresh and be open to a new approach. And that is one that we all have to learn and do more probably. Laurel: Absolutely. Thank you very much, Daniela, for what has been a fantastic episode of the Business Lab.

","This is today's edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what's going on in the world of technology. How China’s biggest online influencers fell from their thrones No one had foreseen just how fast three of China’s most powerful influencers would fall. On June 3, Austin Li, a 30-year-old live-streamer with over 60 million followers, abruptly cut off a live stream after a tank-shaped ice cream dessert appeared on the screen. While he later posted that it was due to “technical difficulties,” most people understand it as having triggered government censors, who interpreted it as a reference to the Tiananmen Square massacre.Li isn’t known to have been arrested, and his account remains active, but he hasn’t streamed or posted on social media since. Fans suspect he may not be allowed to stream again.Live-streaming e-commerce in China is a massive industry worth over $180 billion. Influencers like Li have risen to rival the popularity of A-list celebrities, and have been known to facilitate billions of dollars worth of online purchases in one night.  But in Li’s and at least two other cases, these online empires were toppled overnight in what appears to be a government crackdown extending back to late 2021—suggesting a reckoning is well underway.  Read the full story. —Zeyi Yang The must-reads I’ve combed the internet to find you today’s most fun/important/scary/fascinating stories about technology.1 We’re still being kept in the dark about the origins of covidWe need more data from China, a new WHO report says.

","This is today's edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what's going on in the world of technology. Chinese hackers exploited years-old software flaws to break into telecom giants The news: Hackers employed by the Chinese government have broken into numerous major telecommunications firms around the world in a cyber-espionage campaign that has lasted at least two years, according to a new advisory from American security agencies.  How it happened: The hackers allegedly breached their targets by exploiting old and well-known critical vulnerabilities in popular networking hardware. Once they had a foothold inside their targets, the hackers used the compromised devices to gain full access to the network traffic of numerous private companies and government agencies, US officials said. They did not name those affected by the campaign, nor explain the impact it had.  What it means: The campaign is a warning about the need for better basic cybersecurity for some of the most important networks in the world, and a dramatic illustration of the danger software flaws pose even years after they’re discovered and made public. Read the full story. —Patrick Howell O'Neill The aviation industry can hit emissions goals, but new fuels need to take flight first Cutting carbon emissions from planes is going to be difficult—but not impossible, according to a new report by the International Council on Clean Transportation. The report outlines possible paths for aviation to reduce emissions enough to do its part in keeping global warming at less than 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, the target set by the Paris agreement. It says that about 60% of emissions reductions are projected to come from low-carbon fuels, with the rest coming from efficiencies, and lower demand.

A few minutes later, the screen showed the other ship back at the dock. Then it was in the channel and moving again, then back at the dock, then gone once more. Eventually, mystified, the captain picked up his binoculars and scanned the dockside. The other ship had been stationary at the dock the entire time.

Chinese hackers exploited years-old software flaws to break into telecom giants,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/06/08/1053375/chinese-hackers-exploited-years-old-software-flaws-to-break-into-telecom-giants/,2022-06-08,"<p>A multi-year hacking campaign shows how dangerous old flaws can linger for years.</p>
","Hackers employed by the Chinese government have broken into numerous major telecommunications firms around the world in a cyber-espionage campaign that has lasted at least two years, according to a new advisory from American security agencies.  The hackers allegedly breached their targets by exploiting old and well-known critical vulnerabilities in popular networking hardware. Once they had a foothold inside their targets, the hackers used the compromised devices to gain full access to the network traffic of numerous private companies and government agencies, US officials said. The advisory did not include the names of those affected by the campaign, nor did it detail the impact it has had. But US officials did point out the specific networking devices, such as routers and switches, that hackers in China are thought to have targeted repeatedly, exploiting severe and well-known vulnerabilities that effectively gave the attackers free rein over their targets. “These devices are often overlooked by cyber defenders,” the American advisory warned. They “struggle to maintain and keep pace with routine software patching of Internet-facing services and endpoint devices.” The new advisory is the latest example of a radical shift among US intelligence agencies away from a culture of silence and secrecy. The organizations now routinely speak publicly to issue cybersecurity guidance. The new document is designed to help victims detect and eject hackers who have been infiltrating their networks for years.  And it’s something bigger, too: a warning about the need for better basic cybersecurity for some of the most important networks in the world. Telecommunication firms are extremely high-value targets for intelligence agencies. These companies build and run on most of the infrastructure of the internet as well as many private networks around the world. Successfully hacking them can mean opening doors to an even bigger world of prized spying opportunities.  The United States has its own documented history of such attacks. The National Security Agency, for example, once infiltrated the Chinese telecom and internet giant Huawei, reportedly both to spy on the company itself and to exploit the networking and telecommunications products Huawei sells worldwide. Ironically, that operation was prompted in part by continuing American fears that Beijing could use Huawei’s hardware to spy on American interests. This is a big moment of turbulence and change for the hacking business. But the demand is here to stay. In the newly reported cyber campaign, the Chinese hackers allegedly exploited networking devices from major vendors like Cisco, Citrix, and Netgear. All of the vulnerabilities were publicly known, including a five-year-old critical flaw in Netgear routers that allows attackers to bypass authentication checks and execute any code they choose—an opening that allows for a full takeover of the device and an unfettered window into the victim’s network. The campaign’s success is a dramatic illustration of the danger software flaws pose even years after they’re discovered and made public. Zero-day attacks—hacks exploiting previously unknown weaknesses—pack a punch and demand attention. But known flaws remain potent because networks and devices can be difficult to update and secure with limited resources, personnel, and money. Rob Joyce, a senior National Security Agency official, explained that the advisory was meant to give  step-by-step instructions on finding and expelling the hackers. “To kick [the Chinese hackers] out, we must understand the tradecraft and detect them beyond just initial access,” he tweeted. Joyce echoed the advisory, which directed telecom firms to enact basic cybersecurity practices like keeping key systems up to date, enabling multifactor authentication, and reducing the exposure of internal networks to the internet. According to the advisory, the Chinese espionage typically began with the hackers using open-source scanning tools like RouterSploit and RouterScan to survey the target networks and learn the makes, models, versions, and known vulnerabilities of the routers and networking devices.  With that knowledge, the hackers were able to use old but unfixed vulnerabilities to access the network and, from there, break into the servers providing authentication and identification for targeted organizations. They stole usernames and passwords, reconfigured routers, and successfully exfiltrated the targeted network’s traffic and copied it to their own machines. With these tactics, they were able to spy on virtually everything going on inside the organizations.  The hackers then turned around and deleted log files on every machine they touched in an attempt to destroy evidence of the attack. US officials didn’t explain how they ultimately found out about the hacks despite the attackers’ attempts to cover their tracks. The Americans also omitted details on exactly which hacking groups they are accusing, as well as the evidence they have that indicates the Chinese government is responsible. The advisory is yet another alarm the United States has raised about China. FBI deputy director Paul Abbate said in a recent speech that China “conducts more cyber intrusions than all other nations in the world combined.” When asked about this report, a spokesperson from the Chinese embassy in Washington DC denied that China engages in any hacking campaigns against other countries.  This story has been updated with comment from the Chinese embassy in Washington.

How censoring China’s open-source coders might backfire,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/05/30/1052879/censoring-china-open-source-backfire/,2022-05-30,"<p>Many suspect the Chinese state has forced Gitee, the Chinese competitor to GitHub, to censor open-source code in a move developers worry could obstruct innovation.</p>
","On May 18, thousands of software developers in China woke up to find that their open-source code hosted on Gitee, a state-backed Chinese competitor to the international code repository platform GitHub, had been locked and hidden from public view. Later that day, Gitee released a statement explaining that the locked code was being manually reviewed, as all open-source code would need to be before being published from then on. The company “didn’t have a choice,” it wrote. Gitee didn’t respond when MIT Technology Review asked why it had made the change, but it is widely assumed that the Chinese government had imposed yet another bit of heavy-handed censorship. For the open-source software community in China, which celebrates transparency and global collaboration, the move has come as a shock. Code was supposed to be apolitical. Ultimately, these developers fear, it could discourage people from contributing to open-source projects, and China’s software industry will suffer from the lack of collaboration. “Code review in OSS is about improving the code quality and building trust between developers. Adding politics to the code review will hurt both, and eventually roll back the open-source movement in China,” says Han Xiao, the Berlin-based founder of Jina AI, a commercial open-source software company.  GitHub, founded in 2008 and acquired by Microsoft in 2018, is the go-to platform developers around the world use to publish their code and then critique and learn from each other. This publicly available code—as opposed to the proprietary code created by companies or individuals—is referred to as open-source software. Of the 73 million people using GitHub as of 2021, 7.5 million are based in China, making them the largest group outside the United States. But that level of dependence on the platform made the Chinese government wary, especially since American sanctions against Huawei in 2019 reminded it how much the nation still relies on certain foreign companies and services. GitHub is one of them. At least one open-source software project has had malicious code added which aimed to wipe computers located in Russia and Belarus. At the same time, the open-source industry was growing fast in China. Major companies like Tencent and Alibaba released their own version of GitHub, and Gitee, backed by the established open-source community OSChina, began to take the lead in the domestic competition. So in 2020, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology contracted a consortium of companies and universities, led by Gitee, to grow the existing repository into a “Chinese independent open-source hosting platform.” Gitee now boasts over 8 million users. Over time, some developers started to prefer Gitee over GitHub for a mix of reasons, from performance and cost to protection from foreign intervention.  For Daniel Bovensiepen Li, a Beijing-based research scientist who uses Gitee for both personal and professional projects, its main advantage is that it is based in mainland China, which makes its service faster and more stable. “Due to this proximity, the performance is dramatically better than GitHub or GitLab [a similar overseas platform],” he says. Li has 24 projects hosted on Gitee that were affected by the latest change.  Institutions with government ties are more likely to use Gitee. “The military, public universities, and state-owned companies—they are concerned with the fact that GitHub is eventually owned by Microsoft, an American company,” says Thomas Yao, the Shanghai-based founder of GitCafe, one of China’s earliest GitHub-like websites, which he sold to Tencent in 2016. Students and amateur developers can also be deterred from using GitHub by the costs and the difficulty of finding reliable VPN services in China, he says. For now, there’s little clue as to what prompted the change, but censorship of certain types of language—profanity, pornography, and politically sensitive words—has been creeping up on the platform for a while. On Gitee’s official and public feedback page, there are multiple user complaints about how projects were censored for unclear reasons, possibly because technical language was mistaken for a sensitive word. The immediate result of Gitee’s May 18 change was that public projects hosted on the platform suddenly became unavailable without notice. Users complained that this disrupted services or even ruined their business deals. For the code to be made public again, developers need to submit an application and confirm it doesn’t contain anything that violates Chinese law or infringes copyrights. Li went through the manual review for all his projects on Gitee, and so far 22 out of 24 have been restored. “Yet I assume that the review process is not a one-time thing, so the question is if the friction of hosting projects will increase in the future,” he says. Still, with no better domestic alternative, Li expects users to stay: “People might not like what Gitee is doing, but [Gitee] will still be required to get their daily job done.” In the long run, this puts an unreasonable burden on the developers. “When you are coding, you are also writing comments and setting up names for the variables. Which developer, while writing code, would like to be thinking whether their code could trigger the list of sensitive words?” says Yao. With almost every other aspect of the internet, the Chinese way of building its own alternative has worked well in recent years. But with open-source software, a direct product of cross-border collaboration, China seems to have run into a wall.  “This push to insulate the domestic open-source community from risks arising from the global community is something that very much goes against the core proposition of open-source tech development,” says Rebecca Arcesati, an analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies and coauthor of a report on China’s bet on open-source.  Technologists in China, she says, don’t want to be cut off from the global software development conversation and may feel uncomfortable with the direction China is heading: “The more Beijing tries to nationalize open-source and create an indigenous ecosystem, the less eager developers will be to participate in what they perceive to be government-led open-source projects.”  And cutting off its global ties prematurely may interrupt the fast growth of China’s open-source software industry before its benefits to the economy can be realized. It’s part of a broader concern that overshadows China’s tech sector as the government has ramped up regulations in recent years: is China sacrificing the long-term benefits of tech for short-term impact? “I struggle to see how China can make do without those global links with international open-source communities and foundations,” Arcesati says. “We are not there yet.” ","On May 18, thousands of software developers in China woke up to find that their open-source code hosted on Gitee, a state-backed Chinese competitor to the international code repository platform GitHub, had been locked and hidden from public view.

From smart devices…","In association withKeysight  The world is rapidly moving from human-directed manufacturing using computerized assembly lines to largely automated smart factories that manufacture more efficiently using real-time data. Considered by many to be the fourth industrial revolution, or ""Industry 4.0,"" this transformation requires a bevy of technologies to deliver on its promise of ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). From smart devices to machine-learning systems to pervasive communications, the need for ultra-high speeds and reliability requires technologies that can connect in a variety of situations while remaining compliant with regional regulations.  Technology and telecommunications providers have created a solution—5G private networks—to address the challenge.  The manufacturing industry is exploring 5G technology at an accelerated pace, largely to enable AI-driven use cases such as closed-loop manufacturing, adaptive manufacturing, predictive analytics for maintenance, and extended reality (XR)-based worker training and safety, says Jagadeesh Dantuluri, general manager for private and dedicated networks at Keysight Technologies. ""It's not about a static assembly line performing the same action time and time again, but one that can change based on their needs,"" he says. ""Private networks essentially enable new business models in manufacturing."" Yet, the benefits of 5G private networks extend beyond manufacturing. Because the technology offers more reliable connectivity, faster data rates and lower latency, and greater scalability, security, and network control than previous communications technologies, 5G private networks will drive innovations in many industrial and enterprise sectors. A private cellular network is built on 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-defined standards (such as LTE or 5G), but it offers dedicated on-premise coverage. This is important for remote facilities where public networks do not exist, or where indoor coverage is not robust. A private network also makes exclusive use of the available capacity; there is no contention from other network users, as on a public network. Private operators can also deploy their own security policies to authorize users, prioritize traffic, and, most importantly, to ensure that sensitive data does not leave the premises without authorization. ​​The dedicated nature of 5G private networks coupled with a customized service, intrinsic control, and URLLC capabilities provides more reliable industrial wireless communication for a wide variety of use cases, Dantuluri says “Applications include wireless, real-time, closed-loop control and process automation, and AI-based production and AR/VR-based design for onsite and remote workers,” he explains. “In addition, low-cost connectivity allows sensors to become easily deployed in a wider variety of scenarios, allowing businesses to create innovative applications and collect real-time data.” ​The industrial sector is driving toward a massive digital transformation, and the integration of information-technology (IT) systems with operational-technology (OT) systems will speed up this process.  Digital technologies will also enable many new use cases, such as automated manufacturing.   A 5G private network enables a facility to synchronize and integrate tracking data into its workflow, allowing production lines to be configured in real time, says Dantuluri. “Since the factory’s assembly lines and infrastructure, such as robotic arms, autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs), and sensors, are wirelessly connected, configuring or moving assembly elements on demand is much easier. This use case demands highly reliable, low-latency wireless connectivity and coverage, and potentially high data rates in both the uplink and downlink, and maybe support for Time Sensitive Networks (TSN) in the future. This use case application can only be achieved with 5G private networks.” Outside the industrial sector, 5G private networks enable mobile augmented-reality (AR) and virtual-reality (VR) applications, allowing, for example, engineers to view superimposed blueprints, soldiers to have heads-up displays, and businesses to have virtual meetings in the field or working remotely. ""If a machine has to be repaired, and a technician or a factory worker has AR goggles, they can have technical information superimposed on the real-world device to see what is wrong,"" says Dantuluri. ""And the data center can send instructions about how to do the repairs, step by step."" As enterprises realize the benefits of pervasive, low-latency, high-bandwidth, and secure connectivity, the applications of 5G private networks will expand. By the end of 2024, analysts expect investment in 5G private networks will add up to tens of billions of dollars. A separate analysis by the research arm of investment firm JP Morgan predicts that the global enterprise opportunity for 5G will exceed $700 billion by 2030. Better security 5G private networks have improved upon previous 4G standalone network security and are better able to address several existing security threats. Like most new technology, 5G private networks will likely have security issues that need to be addressed, but security has become a primary consideration in both developing the standards for 5G and in the implementation approaches. In addition, companies can further augment those security features with novel technologies, such as more robust encryption schemes and zero trust architecture, as private networks afford complete control to its owner—a benefit not possible on public networks. The focus on improving security will drive new and innovative applications, especially in high-security areas such as seaports and airports, says Dantuluri. ""Private networks provide the flexibility of movement that seaports require,"" he says. ""In airports, after a plane lands, engine data can begin downloading before the plane even docks to the gate, which saves a lot of time and helps airlines stay on schedule."" Wireless flexibility Most manufacturing robots are tethered to wired networks, but improved connectivity and better security means that connected devices can more easily move around and stay connected to necessary systems and data. In addition, 5G networks are built to allow devices to remain connected when moving between cells, whereas many Wi-Fi networks require devices to reconnect after moving.  This advantage pays off in scenarios where a large area needs to be covered by a wireless network, Dantuluri says. ""Facilities like mines, airports, and seaports require significant geographic coverage in the order of several square kilometers,"" he says. ""Other wireless technologies have very limited range, making them unsuitable for these use cases."" In addition, there are benefits for remote applications as well. Today, most offshore oil rigs, for example, rely on separate satellite communications and local networks. Not only are 5G private network connections more secure and interoperable, but they reduce the cost of hybrid communications, combining local area, cellular, and satellite networks. Industry has quickly evolved over the past two decades, from steam-powered machines automating manufacturing, to assembly lines simplifying production, to computerized systems creating more precise products. Machine learning and fast, reliable connectivity promise to make the next industrial revolution, Industry 4.0, possible.  Every industry will apply Industry 4.0 advances to help improve their operations. 5G private networks will be crucial to that effort. ""Today, automation is significant, but is all done with wires, so systems—industries, robotics, sensors—are difficult to quickly customize,"" says Dantuluri. ""As 5G private network adoption increases, all systems will be automated and connected with low-latency wireless, which will enable adaptive business models.""

Considered by many to be the fourth industrial revolution, or ""Industry 4.0,"" this transformation requires a bevy of technologies to deliver on its promise of ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). From smart devices to machine-learning systems to pervasive communications, the need for ultra-high speeds and reliability requires technologies that can connect in a variety of situations while remaining compliant with regional regulations. Technology and telecommunications providers have created a solution—5G private networks—to address the challenge. The manufacturing industry is exploring 5G technology at an accelerated pace, largely to enable AI-driven use cases such as closed-loop manufacturing, adaptive manufacturing, predictive analytics for maintenance, and extended reality (XR)-based worker training and safety, says Jagadeesh Dantuluri, general manager for private and dedicated networks at Keysight Technologies. ""It's not about a static assembly line performing the same action time and time again, but one that can change based on their needs,"" he says. ""Private networks essentially enable new business models in manufacturing."" Yet, the benefits of 5G private networks extend beyond manufacturing. Because the technology offers more reliable connectivity, faster data rates and lower latency, and greater scalability, security, and network control than previous communications technologies, 5G private networks will drive innovations in many industrial and enterprise sectors. A private cellular network is built on 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-defined standards (such as LTE or 5G), but it offers dedicated on-premise coverage. This is important for remote facilities where public networks do not exist, or where indoor coverage is not robust. A private network also makes exclusive use of the available capacity; there is no contention from other network users, as on a public network. Private operators can also deploy their own security policies to authorize users, prioritize traffic, and, most importantly, to ensure that sensitive data does not leave the premises without authorization. ​​The dedicated nature of 5G private networks coupled with a customized service, intrinsic control, and URLLC capabilities provides more reliable industrial wireless communication for a wide variety of use cases, Dantuluri says “Applications include wireless, real-time, closed-loop control and process automation, and AI-based production and AR/VR-based design for onsite and remote workers,” he explains. “In addition, low-cost connectivity allows sensors to become easily deployed in a wider variety of scenarios, allowing businesses to create innovative applications and collect real-time data.” ​The industrial sector is driving toward a massive digital transformation, and the integration of information-technology (IT) systems with operational-technology (OT) systems will speed up this process. Digital technologies will also enable many new use cases, such as automated manufacturing. A 5G private network enables a facility to synchronize and integrate tracking data into its workflow, allowing production lines to be configured in real time, says Dantuluri. “Since the factory’s assembly lines and infrastructure, such as robotic arms, autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs), and sensors, are wirelessly connected, configuring or moving assembly elements on demand is much easier. This use case demands highly reliable, low-latency wireless connectivity and coverage, and potentially high data rates in both the uplink and downlink, and maybe support for Time Sensitive Networks (TSN) in the future. This use case application can only be achieved with 5G private networks.” Outside the industrial sector, 5G private networks enable mobile augmented-reality (AR) and virtual-reality (VR) applications, allowing, for example, engineers to view superimposed blueprints, soldiers to have heads-up displays, and businesses to have virtual meetings in the field or working remotely. ""If a machine has to be repaired, and a technician or a factory worker has AR goggles, they can have technical information superimposed on the real-world device to see what is wrong,"" says Dantuluri. ""And the data center can send instructions about how to do the repairs, step by step."" As enterprises realize the benefits of pervasive, low-latency, high-bandwidth, and secure connectivity, the applications of 5G private networks will expand. By the end of 2024, analysts expect investment in 5G private networks will add up to tens of billions of dollars. A separate analysis by the research arm of investment firm JP Morgan predicts that the global enterprise opportunity for 5G will exceed $700 billion by 2030. Better security 5G private networks have improved upon previous 4G standalone network security and are better able to address several existing security threats. Like most new technology, 5G private networks will likely have security issues that need to be addressed, but security has become a primary consideration in both developing the standards for 5G and in the implementation approaches. In addition, companies can further augment those security features with novel technologies, such as more robust encryption schemes and zero trust architecture, as private networks afford complete control to its owner—a benefit not possible on public networks. The focus on improving security will drive new and innovative applications, especially in high-security areas such as seaports and airports, says Dantuluri. ""Private networks provide the flexibility of movement that seaports require,"" he says. ""In airports, after a plane lands, engine data can begin downloading before the plane even docks to the gate, which saves a lot of time and helps airlines stay on schedule."" Wireless flexibility Most manufacturing robots are tethered to wired networks, but improved connectivity and better security means that connected devices can more easily move around and stay connected to necessary systems and data. In addition, 5G networks are built to allow devices to remain connected when moving between cells, whereas many Wi-Fi networks require devices to reconnect after moving. This advantage pays off in scenarios where a large area needs to be covered by a wireless network, Dantuluri says. ""Facilities like mines, airports, and seaports require significant geographic coverage in the order of several square kilometers,"" he says. ""Other wireless technologies have very limited range, making them unsuitable for these use cases."" In addition, there are benefits for remote applications as well. Today, most offshore oil rigs, for example, rely on separate satellite communications and local networks. Not only are 5G private network connections more secure and interoperable, but they reduce the cost of hybrid communications, combining local area, cellular, and satellite networks. Industry has quickly evolved over the past two decades, from steam-powered machines automating manufacturing, to assembly lines simplifying production, to computerized systems creating more precise products. Machine learning and fast, reliable connectivity promise to make the next industrial revolution, Industry 4.0, possible. Every industry will apply Industry 4.0 advances to help improve their operations. 5G private networks will be crucial to that effort. ""Today, automation is significant, but is all done with wires, so systems—industries, robotics, sensors—are difficult to quickly customize,"" says Dantuluri. ""As 5G private network adoption increases, all systems will be automated and connected with low-latency wireless, which will enable adaptive business models.""

Pioneered in Japan and popularized by Toyota in the 1970s, the JIT method aims to avoid excess inventory by ordering products and raw materials only when needed to minimize costs and maximize efficiency. But manufacturers of products, from automobiles to consumer electronics, are seeing just how tenuous the JIT model is. When the covid-19 pandemic hit in early 2020, manufacturers of automobiles, electronics, and other tech products expected sales to decrease and so they reduced semiconductor orders. Two years later, the industry is still reeling from that decision. Reducing semiconductor orders resulted in a global shortage of chips that are used to power everything from artificial intelligence to medical equipment, causing some manufacturers to have to pause production. In the automotive industry, for example, US car inventory dropped to below 1 million units in the US in the second half of 2021—roughly one-third of the pre-pandemic level—according to automotive industry services provider Cox Automotive. For the JIT model to work, the quality and supply of raw materials, the production of goods, and the customer demand for them must remain in alignment. If any one of the links in the chain breaks, stalls, or falls out of sync, the impact on the supply chains that crisscross the world can be felt immediately. For companies, unable to deliver on orders in a timely fashion, they risk losing not only efficiency gains but also brand credibility, market share, and revenue. Now, companies are seeking new ways of managing their supply chains that offer greater flexibility and transparency. In the automotive sector, some companies including Nissan and JIT pioneer Toyota are increasing chip inventory levels, while others including Volkswagen and Tesla are trying to secure their own supplies of rare metals. But technologies, including Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, and business applications are also offering companies new ways to avoid disruption and respond to unforeseen circumstances. The transformation of the automotive supply chain is taking place in an increasingly-digitized world, beset with environmental concerns. As climate change concerns intensify, and governments across the world compel industries to switch to more environmentally-friendly practices, the automotive industry and its supply chain networks are undergoing a profound shift. Automotive manufacturers are moving away from internal combustion engines and large-scale manufacturing to zero-emission, carbon-neutral electric or autonomous vehicles with a focus on electric or hydrogen as energy sources. Autonomous vehicles, for example, are seen as “servers on wheels” that rely on batteries, wiring, laser technology, and programming rather than combustion engines. Tech giants such as Japan’s Sony and China’s Baidu have also announced plans for their own electric vehicles (EV), fueling an already heated race in the EV market. According to the International Energy Agency, global sales of electric cars hit 6.6 million in 2021, making up 8.6% of all new car sales: more than double the market share from 2020, and up from a mere 0.01% in 2010. Business insights provider IHS Markit estimates the number of EV models in the US will increase 10 times over, from 26 in 2021 to 276 in 2030. At the same time, charging stations alone will need to increase from 850,000 in 2021 to nearly 12 million in 2030. To meet the increasing need for battery-powered vehicles, manufacturers must establish a new ecosystem of partners that supplies the parts and accessories required for the successful manufacturing and operating of these alternative vehicles. According to research from Transport Intelligence, “the supply chain for the entire powertrain will be transformed and the types of components, the logistics processes employed to move them, the markets of origin and destination as well as the tiered character of automotive supply chains will change.” This has enormous implications for how the automotive supply chain is ordered. Meanwhile, everything in the automotive sector, from the automobiles themselves to entire factories, is becoming more connected, with the support of technologies such AI, IoT, 5G, and robotics. In recent months, Nissan has unveiled its “Intelligent Factory” initiative in its Tochigi plant in the north of Tokyo, which employs AI, IoT, and robotics to manufacture next-generation vehicles in a zero-emission environment. And Volkswagen has deployed a private 5G wireless network at its headquarter plant in Wolfsburg, Germany, to trial new smart factory use cases. As manufacturing becomes more digitized, so too does consumer behavior. Automotive brands are rolling out direct-to-consumer sales models, enabling customers to complete more and more of the sales process through digital channels. While new players are taking an online-only approach to the sales model, incumbents are embracing digital initiatives in partnership with dealers where fulfillment, after sales, and services are still provided through a dealer. In 2020, 69% of dealers in the US added at least one digital step to their sales process. And 75% of dealers agreed that they would not be able to survive long term without moving more of the sales process online. Both models require greater visibility into the supply chain to ensure inventory and availability are accurate. Ever more connected consumers, factories, automobiles, and supply chains generate a wealth of data. Gathering and analyzing this data can help enable manufacturers to reduce business risk and become more agile by identifying potential supply issues, increasing efficiencies, and giving customers more accurate timelines. Predictive analytics, for example, can help manufacturers answer the “What if?” questions and proactively reduce the impact of potential supply chain disruptions. Digital traceability enables companies to follow products and goods as they move along the value chain, providing them with exact information on the provenance of inputs, supplier sourcing practices, and conversion processes. “On the demand side, customers expect real-time visibility of when an automobile will be delivered to them, and the status of service, spare parts, and accessories,” says Mohammed Rafee Tarafdar, SVP and CTO, Infosys. In a bid to harness data and develop greater visibility across the business, manufacturers are employing a variety of technology solutions including business applications—suites of software designed to support business functions. Paired with cloud services, the right business applications can give organizations greater access to cutting-edge technologies, which can then be managed at scale and address the need for visibility, analytics, and cybersecurity. As everything becomes more connected and more autonomous, “there is a need to have technology that can scale with demand. This is where cloud and business applications have very important roles to play,” says Tarafdar, who adds that manufacturers are embracing both private and public cloud to create hybrid clouds, with the support of private 5G networks. As manufacturers modernize the supply chain with the hope of making it more agile and resilient, Tarafdar says that manufacturers will start moving toward a sentient supply chain; that is, a supply chain that can sense, process, and respond in real time. Sentience is applicable to a few areas within the supply chain, including planning, insight, traceability, analytics, and asset and inventory management. For example, the sentient supply chain can recognize if inventory needs to be moved between factories and take the appropriate actions or at least make recommendations subject to approval. “Some of these capabilities aren’t fully baked into the platforms that are currently available,” says Tarafdar, “But investments in cloud, AI, and technology that models the entire supply chain network into a graph, essentially enables us to create a digital brain that can make informed decisions or recommendations.” It’s hard to tell when such digital intelligence will be fully formed. But one thing that experts seem to agree on: the next decade could represent one of the biggest tech disruptions in the global automotive industry, as the line between tech and auto companies becomes increasingly blurred. The development of autonomous and electric vehicles will inject new players into the automotive industry and significantly alter its supply chain practices. Coupled with globalization, disruptive technologies, shifting consumer demands, and changes in manufacturing processes, the automotive supply chain is likely to face some bumps in the road ahead. To drive production efficiency and accelerate time-to-market, attaining optimal supply chain visibility is key. And automakers may need to adopt and adapt to new technologies in cloud, AI, data analytics, machine learning, and IoT to ensure that the new ecosystem of their suppliers will be transparent, agile, and resilient to global volatilities.

Russia hacked an American satellite company one hour before the Ukraine invasion,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/05/10/1051973/russia-hack-viasat-satellite-ukraine-invasion/,2022-05-10,"<p>The attack on Viasat showcases cyber’s emerging role in modern warfare.</p>
","Just an hour before Russian troops invaded Ukraine, Russian government hackers targeted the American satellite company Viasat, officials from the US, EU, and UK said today. The operation resulted in an immediate and significant loss of communication in the earliest days of the war for the Ukrainian military, which relied on Viasat’s services for command and control of the country’s armed forces.  The Viasat cyberattack is the biggest known hack of the war, says Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade, a threat researcher at the cybersecurity firm SentinelOne ""because it’s the most concerted effort to disable Ukrainian military capabilities.” It is also one of the first real-world examples of how cyberattacks can be targeted and timed to amplify military forces on the ground by disrupting and even destroying the technology used by enemy forces. The attack, on February 24, launched destructive “wiper” malware called AcidRain against Viasat modems and routers, quickly erasing all the data on the system. The machines then rebooted and were permanently disabled. Thousands of terminals were effectively destroyed in this way.  Soldiers and tanks may care about national borders. Cyber doesn't. Guerrero-Saade, who has been at the forefront of research into AcidRain, says that where previous malware used by the Russians was narrowly targeted, AcidRaid is more of an all-purpose weapon. “What’s massively concerning about AcidRaid is that they’ve taken all the safety checks off,” he says. “With previous wipers, the Russians were careful to only execute on specific devices. Now those safety checks are gone, and they are brute-forcing. They have a capability they can reuse. The question is, what supply-chain attack will we see next?” The attack has turned out to be typical of the “hybrid” war strategy employed by Moscow, say experts. It was launched in concert with the invasion on the ground. That exact kind of coordination between Russian cyber operations and military forces has been seen at least six times, according to research from Microsoft, underlining the emerging role of cyber in modern warfare.  “Russia’s coordinated and destructive cyberattack before the invasion of Ukraine shows that cyberattacks are used actively and strategically in modern-day warfare, even if the threat and consequences of a cyberattack are not always visible for the public,” the Danish defense minister, Morten Bødskov, said in a statement. “The cyber threat is constant and evolving. Cyberattacks can do great damage to our critical infrastructure, with fatal consequences.” In this instance, the damage spilled over from Ukraine to affect thousands of internet users and internet-connected wind farms in central Europe. And the implications are even bigger than that: Viasat works with the US military and its partners around the world. “Obviously, the Russians messed it up,” says Guerrero-Saade. “I don’t think they meant to have so much splash damage and get the European Union involved. They gave the EU pretext to react by having 5,800 German wind turbines and others around the EU impacted.”  Just a few hours before AcidRain began its destructive work against Viasat, Russian hackers used another wiper, called HermeticWiper, against Ukrainian government computers. The playbook was eerily similar, except instead of satellite communications, the targets were Windows machines on networks that, in those early hours of the invasion, would be important for the government in Kyiv to mount an effective resistance.  How effective these attacks have been remains an open question. A senior Ukraine official said the Viasat hack resulted in a “huge loss in communications in the very beginning of war” but offered no detail.  Cyber is supporting military operations, but it’ll be a long time before we get a full view of all of the operations in play during this war. It’s clear from the way AcidRain was built, though, that we will likely see it in action again.

It’s clear from the way AcidRain was built, though, that we will likely see it in action again.","['hour', 'russian', 'troop', 'invade', 'ukraine', 'russian', 'government', 'hacker', 'target', 'satellite', 'company', 'viasat', 'official', 'say', 'today', 'operation', 'result', 'immediate', 'significant', 'loss', 'communication', 'early', 'day', 'war', 'ukrainian', 'military', 'rely', 'service', 'command', 'control', 'country', 'armed', 'force', 'viasat', 'cyberattack', 'big', 'know', 'hack', 'war', 'say', 'andre', 'guerrerosaade', 'threat', 'researcher', 'cybersecurity', 'firm', 'sentinelone', '’', 'concerted', 'effort', 'disable', 'ukrainian', 'military', 'capability', 'also', 'first', 'realworld', 'example', 'cyberattack', 'target', 'time', 'amplify', 'military', 'force', 'ground', 'disrupt', 'even', 'destroy', 'technology', 'use', 'enemy', 'force', 'attack', 'launch', 'destructive', 'wiper', 'malware', 'call', 'acidrain', 'viasat', 'modem', 'router', 'quickly', 'erase', 'datum', 'system', 'machine', 'reboot', 'permanently', 'disabled', 'thousand', 'terminal', 'effectively', 'destroy', 'way', 'soldier', 'tank', 'care', 'national', 'border', 'cyber', 'guerrerosaade', 'forefront', 'research', 'acidrain', 'say', 'previous', 'malware', 'use', 'narrowly', 'target', 'allpurpose', 'weapon', '’', 'massively', 'concern', 'take', 'safety', 'check', 'say', 'previous', 'wiper', 'careful', 'execute', 'specific', 'device', 'safety', 'check', 'go', 'bruteforce', 'capability', 'reuse', 'question', 'supplychain', 'attack', 'see', 'next', 'attack', 'turn', 'typical', 'hybrid', 'war', 'strategy', 'employ', 'say', 'expert', 'launch', 'concert', 'invasion', 'ground', 'exact', 'kind', 'coordination', 'russian', 'cyber', 'operation', 'military', 'force', 'see', 'least', 'time', 'accord', 'research', 'underline', 'emerge', 'role', 'cyber', 'modern', 'warfare', '’s', 'coordinated', 'destructive', 'cyberattack', 'invasion', 'ukraine', 'show', 'cyberattack', 'use', 'actively', 'strategically', 'modernday', 'warfare', 'even', 'threat', 'consequence', 'cyberattack', 'always', 'visible', 'public', 'danish', 'say', 'statement', 'cyber', 'threat', 'constant', 'evolve', 'cyberattack', 'great', 'damage', 'critical', 'infrastructure', 'fatal', 'consequence', 'instance', 'damage', 'spill', 'ukraine', 'affect', 'thousand', 'internet', 'user', 'internetconnecte', 'wind', 'farm', 'implication', 'even', 'big', 'viasat', 'work', 'military', 'partner', 'world', 'obviously', 'mess', 'say', 'guerrerosaade', 'think', 'mean', 'much', 'splash', 'damage', 'get', 'involve', 'give', 'pretext', 'react', 'german', 'wind', 'turbine', 'impact', 'hour', 'acidrain', 'begin', 'destructive', 'work', 'russian', 'hacker', 'use', 'wiper', 'call', 'hermeticwiper', 'ukrainian', 'government', 'computer', 'playbook', 'eerily', 'similar', 'instead', 'satellite', 'communication', 'target', 'window', 'machine', 'network', 'early', 'hour', 'invasion', 'important', 'government', 'kyiv', 'mount', 'effective', 'resistance', 'effective', 'attack', 'remain', 'open', 'question', 'senior', 'ukraine', 'official', 'say', 'result', 'huge', 'loss', 'communication', 'beginning', 'war', 'offer', 'detail', 'cyber', 'support', 'military', 'operation', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'full', 'view', 'operation', 'play', 'war', '’', 'clear', 'way', 'acidrain', 'build', 'though', 'likely', 'see', 'action']"

                        Today, cloud is computing—a foundational resource for businesses and governments alike as they strive to harness emerging technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence, and the internet of things. 
                     
                                “The cloud is going to play a very important role in providing resilience, agility, and low latency for heavy workloads with millions of people accessing applications.” 
                             
                                “We select our cloud region locations based on customer demand to make services easier and faster for companies, and we also invest in those locations to make sure we have the right talent to serve our customers.”
                             
                                “The future is extremely exciting, almost unimaginably so, when we consider the metaverse and the future of digital business—and the cloud is a very important enabler of both.”
                             
                        The Global Cloud Ecosystem Index 2022 is a snapshot of worldwide cloud development and innovation. It ranks 76 nations and territories on the technology, regulations, and talent they use to promote cloud computing services. The Index consolidates scores given to each nation or territory across four themes, or pillars: infrastructure, ecosystem adoption, security and assurance, and talent and human affinity.
                     
                        The Global Cloud Ecosystem Index is based on the analysis of global macroeconomic, labor, trade, and technology data and primary research interviews with global technology developers, analysts, and policymakers. It quantifies the economies of 76 countries and territories along four separate pillars: infrastructure, ecosystem adoption, security and assurance, and talent and human affinity. 
                     
                        Within each pillar, a series of indicators—lists of qualitative and quantitative factors—were then selected and populated. Through trend analysis and research, weighting assumptions were assigned to determine the relative importance with which each indicator and pillar influenced a country’s cloud computing posture.
